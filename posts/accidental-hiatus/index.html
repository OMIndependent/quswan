<p>Why I held off on updating this site for so long was because I was transferring the data to my other computer. The transition was in the works since 2020, but it didn&#39;t go smoothly. After many attempts of getting this site to generate as I wanted it to, it finally fell into place once I installed other software (npm and nodejs especially), and put the dependencies for the site in properly. Though, there were still some hiccups, even as of now.</p>
<p>After that step, the last part to fix were the liveblogs&#39; inline links (the page/part links that appear below the title). They did not format as it did in the old computer. Since I couldn&#39;t figure out how to correct that bug, I didn&#39;t bother with finishing the transition at all and let this site sit.</p>
<p>I managed a fix earlier today when I saw that the newer version of the markdown package I was using for this computer did not parse markdown text inside any HTML tags. The devs working on the package&#39;s parser <a href=https://github.com/markedjs/marked>marked</a> considered it a bug and removed that feature years ago! So I moved an older version of the package from the old computer, unzipped the contents, moved it to the site&#39;s directory, and that did the trick!</p>
<p>In other news, I&#39;ve already finished liveblogging another game, which I&#39;ll post (along with other old liveblogs, if I ever get that done) in the near future. For now, more Terranigma stuff will be coming.</p>

Gong Xi Fa Cai!</p>
<p>After a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_2025_Southern_California_wildfires>disastrous start</a> to the new year, and a lot of, for lack of a better explanation (or excuse) for not updating this blog, transformations, I&#39;m back!</p>
<p>While browsing for an anime that was on my watchlist on the Crunchyrolls, I stumbled upon <em>Natsume&#39;s Book of Friends</em> again, and saw that there was a seventh season! I saw last year&#39;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVt6Dc1otME">announcement video</a>, and thought that another season was an impossible feat, or that it would take ample time for it to be released.</p>
<p>But it goes to show how fast a year can go by.</p>
<p>Anyway, now that the seventh season of that wonderful, warm show is back, it&#39;s given me slight motivation to start liveblogging again, though mentally tiring as the labor is, after 2 and a half years. I&#39;ll have to get myself acquainted again by rewatching a few episodes before starting up the new season. The <em>Natsume</em> liveblog index page has been updated to take account for that.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve just remembered that I need to transfer the domain name for this liveblog. The price for renewing it is getting too expensive, though the old domain hosts giving it away to another host--most likely because of updated <a href=https://icann.org>ICANN standards</a> a few years ago--are partly to blame for that change. Originally, under the old domain hosts, I would&#39;ve paid around $5.99/year for upkeep, now because of the change in hosting, it&#39;s $39.99/year! I found an alternative domain host, but the transfer process, if I get around to it, will take some time. Usually, domain transfers take around 5-7 days, and since this domain has been with the &quot;new&quot; hosts for a year, it&#39;s probably ready for a move.</p>
<p>As for updates on other stuff like the <em>Tales of Arise</em> playthrough, that will be uploaded soon, provided I have time to post the screencaps and edit my posts.</p>

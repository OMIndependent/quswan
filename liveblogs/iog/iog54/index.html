<p>Alright, after two weeks of inactivity, time to continue this game!</p>
<p>I visit the Jeweler Gem to check how much Red Jewels I&#39;ve collected: 18 so far out of 50. I&#39;m probably not going to get all of them on this playthrough, since I know I missed a few.</p>
<p>That&#39;s a nice detail the devs put in: a glowing lantern at nighttime.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/CJbXbCF.png alt="glowing lantern" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I wait awhile as the Lotus Leaf comes over to our side.</p>
<p>The raft is now crowded with a circle of people and a smattering of drinks.</p>
<p>The person in front asks if I want to join in on their &quot;game.&quot;</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/SGhJyFM.png alt="want to join" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I decide to do it.</p>
<p>He&#39;s shocked, asking us if we want to risk our (or Will&#39;s) young life playing that &quot;game&quot; of theirs.</p>
<p><strong>Man:</strong> &quot;This isn&#39;t just a game. You could lose your life.&quot; Lucky we have Gaia to revive us if things get bad...</p>
<p>He asks us again. I take a deep breath before saying yes.</p>
<p>The Opponent, the man says, is the man with the wide brimmed hat, facing north.</p>
<p><strong>Man:</strong> &quot;He&#39;s a seasoned veteran. I&#39;ve never seen a man so lucky.&quot;</p>
<p>He tells us to ask him for the rules on how to play this dangerous &quot;game.&quot;</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/1NxEger.png alt="someone lose" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I anticipated this a bit...</p>
<p>Some around the raft judge us for our decision.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Unfortunately, for the opponent, he forgot something...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/dPZ7nka.png alt="lucky kruk foot" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>He explains the rules to us.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/YloVzXs.png alt=poison width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>If the picture doesn&#39;t show, this is what the Opponent says: &quot;One of the five glasses contains poison. Drink each one in turn. The one left alive is the winner.&quot; Ooooo boy, a one-in-five chance. But who starts first?</p>
<p>The Opponent starts.</p>
<p>The Opponent yells out a BANZAI as the sped-up version of the battle theme plays.</p>
<p>He drinks...</p>
<p>...he&#39;s alive.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve now a 25 percent chance of surviving this...</p>
<p>I have Will drink the leftmost one...</p>
<p>That&#39;s three left...Opponent&#39;s turn...</p>
<p>...he survives.</p>
<p>Now two more! </p>
<p>I take the rightmost one.</p>
<p>Will notices something!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/cB3Qkpf.png alt="suspicious glass" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I have Will avoid the poisoned cup and drink the top left one instead!</p>
<p>Now there&#39;s one more glass left...</p>
<p>But someone intervenes!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/DPzkOIM.png alt="spectator stop" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Other spectators join in to tell the man to stop, as they know Will won fair and square.</p>
<p>But the Opponent&#39;s pride gets the best of him. He drinks...</p>
<p>The audience intervenes, but to no avail...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The next morning, we&#39;re at a woman&#39;s house, his wife&#39;s. Poor him and his family, though...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/0XlpE7X.png alt=surprised width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>She hands us his last will and testament...</p>
<p><strong>Opponent&#39;s Wife:</strong> &quot;&#39;There are four Kruks outside. Please use them.&#39;&quot;</p>
<p>She sends us off with a message that would not be out of place in a motivational painting.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/QS3sJTB.png alt="real joy love" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We head back down.</p>
<p>Now we have Kruks to ride on! Ho ho ho!</p>
<p>I read the Opponent&#39;s last will and testament:</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Even if I perish, don&#39;t mourn for me. Even if Russian Glass doesn&#39;t cost me my life, it&#39;s my fate to pass away soon. Six months ago, when I found out I was dying, I decided to amass as much money as possible.</strong></p>
<p>Oh my god... <img class=emojione alt=â˜¹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>&quot;<strong>I want it to leave it to my wife, and the child I&#39;ll never see. I made my fortune in spite of the unhappiness I have caused others. If I lose, I want to leave part of my estate to you. Please take care of my four favorite Kruk horses.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>I stop here.</p>

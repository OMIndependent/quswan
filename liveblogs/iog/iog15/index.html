<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>I leave Dark Space and double back to transform into Freedan.</p>
<p>The transformations more quicker than usual this time...</p>
<p>I take care of the rest of the monsters in this area and continue!</p>
<p>Freedan&#39;s more taller than the platforms on screen. Probably it&#39;s to indicate he&#39;s a legendary being of sorts, I think?</p>
<p>A one-way trip down the cliffs we go!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/E85Dcy6.png alt="larai outside" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I can&#39;t move!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/vE4M6Sa.png alt="singing statue" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The statue beneath us is singing, huh?</p>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/eXEGYjKVFK0>We hear the melody.</a></p>
<p>And we&#39;ve learned another tune: the <strong>Melody of the Wind!</strong> This probably might be a useful tune to open the Incan Ruins!</p>
<p>Still as Freedan, I double back to one of the chambers and take care of the floating head on the pedestal that Will couldn&#39;t reach. Defeating the head opened a path somewhere...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>No, it revealed a ramp! Looks like we can now reach the other side of the chamber!</p>
<p>Whoo, what a rush!</p>
<p>On the other side, where I take care of two ever-evasive slimes!</p>
<p>Now to finish off the rest of the enemies in this area...</p>
<p>When I press L or R, Freedan can also attract gems to him as well!</p>
<p>More upgrades yes!</p>
<p>Downstairs to face off against more statues...</p>
<p>Not counting the statue we defeated, there&#39;s <strong>twenty</strong> more enemies in this room!?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/dzoypL7.png alt=twenty width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>More enemies to take care of, and we leap across the moat using the ramps!</p>
<p>Up the stairs, where slimes and floting heads await! We make it to a chest guarded by another statue, and take the contents!</p>
<p>More statues downstairs to face, and our health is low...there goes another herb!</p>
<p>And we now have 200 gems so far, with 4 enemies left!</p>
<p>The last four are more statues, and after pressing the button at the end of the hall, they come to life!</p>
<p>We make it to the bottom of the cliff, where we take care of the last troops here again...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/diI5DxV.png alt="shortcut ladder" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>...and we&#39;ve opened up a shortcut for a quick getaway from here.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Inside the next room of the ruin now...</p>
<p>My goodness, when will we reach the end?</p>
<p>More slimes and statues!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/QcZIg4E.png alt="statues surround switch" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>This might be one of the most important decisions I have to make here.</p>
<p>I move the statues far away from each other as possible, and push the button.</p>
<p>After a short bout, I climb the stairs and rush quickly down the ramp.</p>
<p>I go down another set of stairs and fight some more.</p>
<p>I pick up a large, glowing blue gem, which also recovers some of Freedan&#39;s health!</p>
<p>After the area&#39;s clear, I go up to the northern passage, leading me back to the chamber with the cracked statues! </p>
<p>There&#39;s a Dark Space portal here...</p>
<p>I also notice another explorer, and read his journal.</p>
<p>The explorer&#39;s journal has more info about the Incas.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/mGQwa0P.png alt=explorer width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>&quot;<strong>I have succeeded in deciphering the Incan Melody of the Wind. &#39;Chant in the Golden Room.&#39; Does that mean to play the Melody of the Wind...?</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Now that we have two Incan Statues and the Melody of the Wind, we can probably solve the puzzle the Elder was talking about.</p>
<p>I climb the stairs, grab the second chest&#39;s contents (another Red Jewel!), and clear this area of enemies!</p>
<p>It seems I have to switch back to Will for this next part...</p>

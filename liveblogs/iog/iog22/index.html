<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> I looked at a playthrough of <em>Gaia</em> on YouTube, and it seems that I should&#39;ve talked to Seth and Erik outside on the Incan Ship before going to the stateroom. Seth had a Red Jewel to offer us...</p>
<p>Alright, it&#39;s almost been over a month since I last played through this. Let&#39;s explore this town!</p>
<p>Outside, I talk to the not-so-suspicious figures. They&#39;re asking if we saw a laborer escape...I say no.</p>
<p>The guy sitting down on the wall says &quot;a life lived honestly&quot; and full of &quot;fun and laughter&quot;. I wonder what he means?</p>
<p>A guy &quot;puts on a show&quot; by breathing fire in front of us, and ends up getting his hair on fire!</p>
<p>He runs away.</p>
<p>One guy blocking the alley east tells us to go home. I enter the next house, which is a labor camp...eeee...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/EDUzCPK.png alt=laborers width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>There are green-haired bearded people here.</p>
<p>One&#39;s an atheist, mentioning that if &quot;spirits&quot; did exist, class wouldn&#39;t matter.</p>
<p>The others feel like there&#39;s no hope for them... <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>

<hr>
<p>Back at the brighter side of town, a woman tells us the city was named after its flower, the Freejia.</p>
<p>In a house, a woman mentions worrisome mothers, mentioning her own mother&#39;s worries.</p>
<p>In another house, a woman warns us about the alleys, comparing the city to a rose, which has their thorns. Every rose has its thorn...</p>
<p>Climbing the stairs, we meet the Jeweler Gem on the blue rooftop next to the second house.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/RQDOkzJ.png alt="you have 3 gems" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>3 gems, huh?</p>
<p>I hand him our Red Jewel, and notice another typo!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/yKNFC6T.png alt=4jewels width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I then check his list of goodies. The next prize needs 5 Red Jewels!</p>
<p>I jump off the rooftop!</p>
<p>Noticing a man looking outside, I go back in the second house, go out, jump back down to the flowerbeds, and talk to him. He jumped at the sight of seeing us jump down!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/RMmUhx0.png alt="reward for you" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Slap!!!!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Jeez...</p>
<p>No prizes, huh?</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I go into the house, where he mentions that the upstairs is messy.</p>
<p>The moment I get upstairs, a lovey-dovey couple, the one I saw at the window kissing break apart.</p>
<p>They&#39;re denying that they kissed...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/2vszqea.png alt="something in eye" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We go to the end of the street, and head into a house.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/kaXiZck.png alt="not quite so neat" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The third house down is locked.</p>
<p>I go and meet up with Kara, who&#39;s talking to another local.</p>
<p>She tells us we&#39;re now at the hotel.</p>
<p>I go back to the alleyway and jump down past the adultist man.</p>
<p>Before I head out, I notice an entrance. South of there, a ladder going up to the hotel, where a woman in red is looking at the window.</p>
<p>A man sitting on the corner predicts what&#39;s to come.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/1E65ydQ.png alt="prophecy guy" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>He&#39;s right, but he thinks whoever predicted that is lying.</p>
<p>Inside the tunnel...</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/jVDbXDJ.png alt="labor market" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Oh my god.</p>
<p><strong>Man in front of us:</strong> &quot;When I think of myself in your position, I shudder. I&#39;ve no time to worry about what other people think, it&#39;s hard enough just taking care of myself.&quot; Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>The man on the right tells us something even worse...the laborers are as young as Will.</p>
<p>The hooded man, the trader shoos us, saying no children allowed. What ageism, what hypocrisy...</p>
<p>Outside, the woman in red at the window tells us more grim news.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/WLUBFwn.png alt="woman in red at window" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Unfortunately, downstairs, a man tells us that he&#39;s calling in one of the labor traders to take away the green bearded man in the corner. He&#39;s afraid he might get in even worse trouble.</p>
<p>The green-bearded man tells us not to tell the traders. He&#39;s more worried about the man at the table than himself...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ZGyDvWS.png alt="green hair man hiding" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>No wonder why the front door was locked from the inside...</p>
<p>Back before the inn, a man mentions other news.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/kXp3uXZ.png alt="tourism down" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I wonder why that is?</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Inside the inn, we see...</p>
<p><strong>Lilly!</strong></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/l0iqZk0.png alt="lilly back" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Kara asks if the girl&#39;s Lilly.</p>
<p><strong>Lilly:</strong> &quot;I was worried! It&#39;s been almost a month since we separated! I&#39;ve been working and living in this hotel.&quot;</p>
<p>She says Lance is in the room on the right.</p>
<p>I explore the upstairs first.</p>
<p>In the bedroom on the right, we find a <strong>Red Jewel</strong> in a vase!</p>
<p>I have Will send the Jewel over to the Jeweler Gem! Now that we have five, that means I get a defense boost!</p>
<p>I talk to the Jeweler Gem, who makes it official! We get our prize!</p>
<p>Back at the hotel, the gang&#39;s all here...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/hVsMXBc.png alt="the gang's here" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Kara&#39;s still worried about Erik and Seth. She doesn&#39;t mention them by name, saying she&#39;s glad everyone&#39;s okay.</p>
<p>Lilly notices Erik&#39;s missing too, saying she hasn&#39;t seen him &quot;since last night.&quot;</p>
<p>I talk to Lance.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/RxpCC69.png alt="lance don't remember" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Oh no...</p>
<p><strong>Lance:</strong> &quot;If I don&#39;t know who I am, how did I get here?&quot;</p>
<p>If Erik&#39;s gone, that means...</p>
<p><a name=6></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I head back to the labor market, then we ask the laborer if we could see some of the people at the front...he praises Will for his &quot;courage&quot; and lets him through.</p>
<p>I talk to all of them. The person on the left is Imas, who&#39;s from a country in Asia.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Fx3pU5E.png alt=imas width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>They mention they came from a hunting tribe, mentioning the animals there have died of an &quot;unknown disease.&quot;</p>
<p>The middle person is Remus, who mentions they had to be laborers in order to survive now that their livestock is gone...</p>
<p>The one on the right is the one who sent the message in a bottle while we were adrift.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/h3wMsp4.png alt="i am sam" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Sam he am. Does he like green eggs and ham?</p>
<p>The next thing he says, though, is revelatory.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ap3j2rm.png alt="erik rescued us" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Where did Erik go?</p>
<p>Sam mentions that he and his brothers were caught by the traders...</p>
<p>Sam tells us our next destination to rescue Erik.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/MhLVNnP.png alt="sam gives location to find erik" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I head back to the alley, and go to the leftmost house in the corner, where the definitely-not-suspicious labor trader tells us to leave. Will asks him if Erik&#39;s there.</p>
<p><a name=7></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We hear Erik&#39;s voice.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/JjkiszK.png alt="save erik" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>He gets silenced...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Q4o2bcb.png alt="will breaks down door" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I use Will&#39;s flute to break the door down. I can&#39;t go back, though.</p>
<p>Yay, Erik!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/8FAd81O.png alt="yay erik" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Erik&#39;s excited to see us! </p>
<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> I notice now it&#39;s literally been a month since my last session, and in-game, during our seafaring adventure with Kara, a month passed by!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/uw8EVOy.png alt="man ran away" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Erik:</strong> &quot;I tried to sneak into the camp to rescue three laborer brothers. I was discovered and now I&#39;m like this...&quot;</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/2njIyaR.png alt="diamond mine" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>A diamond mine?</p>
<p>He tells us to save the laborers there, and gives us our next destination to find the mine.</p>
<p>I save at this point.</p>

<p>Will sleeps...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/7e4aEFI.png alt="back in house" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>...and he&#39;s back in his grandparents&#39; house in South Cape!</p>
<p>We head downstairs, where we see a blond woman!</p>
<p>Could this person be Will&#39;s mother?</p>

<p><strong>Shira:</strong> &quot;Look in the sky. The comet is so beautiful. After years and years the comet approaches Earth, then recedes. Some say it&#39;s an unlucky star. Some say it&#39;s a lucky star...&quot;</p>
<p>She gives us a decision on what we think the comet is.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/u95Y40h.png alt="unlucky or lucky star" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I choose &quot;unlucky star,&quot; even though, like she says, it&#39;s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>Shira:</strong> &quot;All right...then hope that the bad luck doesn&#39;t come...&quot;</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/wGaFyWB.png alt="will i am watching over you" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Shira:</strong> &quot;Will...I am always watching over you.&quot;</p>
<p>End of the dream.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Now Lilly wakes Will up...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/TcMloFa.png alt=will! width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The boat&#39;s now ruined. Does this mean everything that happened before was just a dream too?</p>
<p>I have Will climb down the bunk and check the corpses of the Inca.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/thIoWr8.png alt="this was where" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>So the Inca have been gone for a long time...</p>
<p>And what is Lance doing here?</p>
<p>He notices that Will was &quot;acting strange,&quot; so he came along too. Then he met Lilly, and went into a &quot;strange town.&quot; Lilly is not amused.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/a6Eo997.png alt="don't call it strange" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Lance:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s invisible. I&#39;d call that pretty strange.&quot; Oh, Lance. I&#39;m guessing VLD!Lance would more or less say the same thing about Lilly&#39;s village, or he&#39;d find it &quot;awesome.&quot;</p>
<p>He tells Will not to go off without his friends.</p>
<p><strong>Lance:</strong> &quot;Since we&#39;re friends, we have to share good times and bad.&quot;</p>
<p>I talk to Lilly, who mentions that &quot;the Elder must have read his fortune&quot; because of Will&#39;s lateness.</p>
<p><strong>Lilly:</strong> &quot;He said that you were floating alone on the sea. I was so surprised.&quot;</p>
<p>So the Incas Will met were real, in a way.</p>
<p>The ship is still sailing...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/6hKK9HX.png alt="queen skeleton" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Oh my god!</p>
<p>I go down to the basement. All the barrels are open and empty...</p>
<p>Back to the stateroom...</p>
<p><strong>Kara:</strong> &quot;They perished waiting for the King&#39;s return...I can&#39;t stand anything that disrupts people&#39;s peaceful lives...&quot;</p>
<p>I examine the Queen. The ring is still on her finger.</p>
<p>Lilly walks over to us.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/biYU7SE.png alt="that ring" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Lilly:</strong> &quot;That ring must be one of the artifacts put on this ship. [The ring] is the most valuable of all the artifacts.&quot;<br>
<strong>Kara:</strong> &quot;Many people lost their lives trying to get rich by finding this ring.&quot; All of these explorers just came in the ruins, all for a ring...</p>
<p>Kara, however, wants the ring. Oh Kara...</p>
<p>Lilly dissuades her from taking the ring, thinking it&#39;s cursed.</p>
<p>Now there&#39;s a whole lot of shaking going on...it seems the ship&#39;s being fired on!</p>
<p><strong>Lilly:</strong> &quot;Maybe it belongs to Riverson!&quot;</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/44gz7nR.png alt=riverson! width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Riverson?</p>
<p>Lilly mentions the dangers of the sea, mentioning &quot;fish that are as dangerous as, well, sharks!&quot;</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Lance asks Will if he&#39;s alright.</p>
<p>More damage to the ship!</p>
<p>And a scream!</p>
<p>It&#39;s Seth!</p>
<p>So this must mean Erik&#39;s here too...</p>
<p>I head out after checking the basement again.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/bBp2mrH.png alt="it's seth" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>By the way Erik responded, things are not good...he&#39;s trying to get himself together...</p>
<p><strong>Erik:</strong> &quot;A huge enormous giant fish ran into the ship! [...] Seth fell in the water! He was swallowed!&quot;</p>
<p>Another shake!</p>
<p>Erik now sees the fish again!</p>
<p>Lance tells him to grab something from the ship!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/mL6pH6a.png alt="ship shaking" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The shaking gets harder as the trio is thrown off from the ship into different locations!</p>

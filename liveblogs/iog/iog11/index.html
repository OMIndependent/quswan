<p>Okay, time to leave this little seaside village!</p>
<p>Lilly and Kara are already at the table downstairs, Kara still optimistic.</p>
<p>After saying we&#39;re ready, Kara&#39;s still keeping her optimism. Lilly&#39;s not so sure...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/dmSFbVZ.png alt="more hardships" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>It seems Kara&#39;s tempting fate at this point.</p>
<p><strong>Kara:</strong> &quot;You&#39;re nitpicking.&quot;</p>
<p>Lilly gets closer to Kara&#39;s face.</p>
<p><strong>Lilly:</strong> &quot;...have you ever been outside the castle?&quot;</p>
<p>Hoo boy...This is <strong>not</strong> one of my favorite tropes playing out here.</p>
<p>Lilly questions Kara&#39;s ignorance yet again, and says Will&#39;s her friend.</p>
<p>Kara then asks Will if he&#39;s her friend. Yes.</p>
<p>She has Will take her by the hand.</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Together, the three set off for Lilly&#39;s village.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Back out to the world map, where Lilly&#39;s village lays dormant in the mountains northwest of Edward&#39;s Castle.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/HEKO9eu.png alt="itory enter" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I also notice there&#39;s a &quot;Moon Tribe Camp&quot; northwest of the village.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Here we are at last!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/6VBpArM.png alt="itory village" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Lilly tells us why the village looks empty.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/3EkFHic.png alt=surprised width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>She asks Will to play Grandma Grandma&#39;s melody.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t move anywhere, as Lilly tells me to play Grandma&#39;s melody where he&#39;s standing now.</p>
<p>Will does so.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s see what happens next...</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>The melody, carried on the wind, spread over the meadow.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>A flash of light later...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/zXfO1OF.png alt="village revealed" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>...and a cabin reveals itself!</p>
<p><strong>Lilly:</strong> &quot;Were you surprised?&quot;</p>
<p>She explains the barrier in the village again. Lilly then complains about Kara complaining. She then tells us to meet up with her at her house.</p>
<p>I go into the nearby cabin where a woman&#39;s there.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/kKxnSXL.png alt="woman inca" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Another mention of the Incas.</p>
<p>She mentions how they used melodies to deliver messages, and probably, tell tales.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a steep grass hill here that Will can&#39;t run up to...</p>
<p>Another woman tells us to be friends with Lilly, since there&#39;s no one else her age in the village. Poor Lilly...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>At the steps, we see...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/AKCwO9E.png alt="will over here" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Yay!</p>
<p>Grandma Grandma explained what happened to their house.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/48Brnyc.png alt=jackal width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Bill:</strong> &quot;[The Jackal] almost got us!&quot;</p>
<p>Grandma Grandma tells us Grandpa Bill panicked. She then mentioned how she took care of the intruding soldiers.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/zB94Gim.png alt="marsupial pie" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Hee...good old Grandma&#39;s cooking. I wonder where she gets her ingredients?</p>
<p>Grandma thanks Lilly for helping and for having Kara come around too. Lilly&#39;s not too friendly with Kara.</p>
<p>Lilly tells us we can go around the village to explore, but to go to her house once we&#39;re done.</p>
<p>Kara joins Lilly.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We go down the grassy ramp...what a fast descent!</p>
<p>I head outside a bit. Checking the map, it seems the Inca Temple that Will&#39;s father wants us to go to is northeast of the village.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/VZiJVp0.png alt=map width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I climb up the stone steps north, on top of where old ruins are.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/5alUfpy.png alt=messenger width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Hmmm, a messenger...</p>
<p>Up ahead, we see another doorway to Dark Space, covered by the ruins&#39; pillars.</p>
<p>A guy tells us to keep running down the steep stone slide here.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/2efGS2S.png alt="steep stone slide" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We do so...</p>
<p><strong>Whoa!</strong></p>
<p>We fly all the way to the other side, where we&#39;re now at a graveyard!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/aXFYdlz.png alt=voice width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Voice:</strong> &quot;<strong>You&#39;ve come, Will...</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>We ignore the voice and make it back to the village!</p>
<p>Inside a house, one man tells us about people making their way to the ruins looking for Incan gold, saying that no one ever made it out of there.</p>
<p>A woman shares my opinion on these invaders.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/2xfBtiB.png alt="robbery wrong" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Next stop: Dark Space.</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Looks like I might get upgrades if I approach that statue on the left...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/858Plzd.png alt="new dark space" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Gaia gives out more advice about Will&#39;s newfound power, which &quot;can destroy obstacles.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Gaia:</strong> &quot;Always be alert. If you find a suspicious place, try to destroy it.&quot;</p>
<p>I have Will go to the statue of himself, where he gains a new power: the <strong>Psycho Dash!</strong></p>
<p>Gaia explains Will&#39;s new power. In a way, it&#39;s basically a speed tackle.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/KZ53S3E.png alt="speed tackle" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I have Will go back out and make a running leap to the graveyard to take this screencap.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/1PKMKqV.png alt="fly will fly" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Whoo, Will&#39;s flying!</p>
<p>At the graveyard, there seems to be an apparition above the center grave.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/h7LIDZu.png alt=ghost width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I have Will ignore him and climb the ladder down to a cave.</p>
<p>What could be in there?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/QoVw2DK.png alt="cave entrance" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><a name=6></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Inside the cave are some unlit braziers. Nothing here so far.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/FXGd4oh.png alt="inside cave" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I go back up, where I talk to the apparition, the Elder&#39;s ghost.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/F4ioqU9.png alt="flower spirit" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>A Flower Spirit?</p>
<p>The Elder changes the subject.</p>
<p><strong>Elder:</strong> &quot;You really look like your father. It seems like only yesterday that he came to this village.&quot;<br>
<strong>Will:</strong> &quot;My father...&quot;</p>
<p>The Elder brings up Will&#39;s mother, Shira, next.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/vjkLIya.png alt=shira width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Elder:</strong> &quot;Your father fell in love with her and took her from the village. All of the Itory tribe have a strange power but Shira&#39;s was especially strong. She made a barrier to hide the town, but your father came through that easily.&quot;</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/SnzbZGs.png alt=unusual width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Now I&#39;m getting more interested in who Will&#39;s father, Olman, is. If he can cross through the barrier, what kind of power does he possess?</p>
<p>The Elder asks Will if he was &quot;summoned by his father.&quot; I answer yes.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/8k1d7P6.png alt="prophecy true" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>A prophecy? What did Grandma Grandma predict?</p>
<p>He asks us if we&#39;re going. Going to the Incan Ruins, I&#39;m guessing.</p>
<p>The Elder gives us an <strong>Incan Statue</strong>, the key to open the ruin.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/EOwtwRw.png alt="key to incan riddle" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Elder:</strong> &quot;One statue is enshrined in the cave below. Use all your skill to find it.&quot;</p>
<p>So he&#39;s not handing the statue to us directly, but giving us the way to get it.</p>
<p>Back to the village we go!</p>
<p><a name=7></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I check the menu, and the Dash we received from Dark Space is there!</p>
<p>I save and go to Lilly&#39;s house.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/hwFD3Sc.png alt="lilly and kara table" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>There&#39;s Lilly and Kara...</p>
<p>Lilly&#39;s a bit surprised by our visit to the Elder&#39;s grave.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/LGuLvLC.png alt="incan statue?" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>She mentions the Incan Statue located in the cave below the graveyard. Lilly then gives us a hint about how to access the cave.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Sh3TeRZ.png alt="wall different sound" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Lucky Will has that Dash power from Gaia.</p>
<p>Kara likes the breeziness of Itory. I wish she could actually help Will though...</p>
<p>I talk to Grandpa Bill, who mentions our trip in prison.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/gfwACfh.png alt="shiny silver stone" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Bill:</strong> &quot;There&#39;s a strange power in that stone. Even if defeated by an enemy, if you have 100 of them, you will live again.&quot;</p>
<p>So that explains the heart indicator on the HUD below the player. It&#39;s basically the number of lives Will has left before he has to go to the start of a level.</p>
<p>Grandma Grandma mentions her prophecy to us.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/vmNNzjR.png alt=prophecy width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Grandma:</strong> &quot;<strong>A child with a good heart who controls the Dark Power will set out to save the world... At that time, a huge comet will enter Earth&#39;s orbit, and a Dark Power will arise...</strong>&quot;</p>

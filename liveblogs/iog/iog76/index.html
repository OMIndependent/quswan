<p>I sink Shadow to the hub, and dash to the fifth chamber, or the second east room!</p>
<p>The number of enemies in this passages are slightly less than the ones in others...</p>
<p>Shadow&#39;s now strong enough to take the guards out in two swipes of their arm!</p>
<p>After a small trip downstairs, we come across our first obstacle for tonight&#39;s session!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/XFM52Fy.png alt="big chasm" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I look around to find any ways to get across the wide chasm, and have Shadow sink into the floor...</p>
<p>We land in between two security measures!</p>
<p>Going up the stairway leads to another stairway going down...say that five times fast!</p>
<p>I take to the west stairway, which is two sets of stairs.</p>
<p>After more security orb eliminations, we manage to make it to the other side of the chasm!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/uHz0vn2.png alt="other side" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Back to the stairway going up going to the stairway going down!</p>
<p>We encounter another wide chasm, where two invisible forces start throwing fireballs!</p>
<p>I go back up to the top, and sink into the floor. Before I have Shadow sink in, I notice another invisible fireball-throwing force!</p>
<p>At the bottom, I see another chest with a Red Jewel inside!</p>
<p>Since there&#39;s no way to return directly back up, I use the nearby portal to take us to the entrance.</p>
<p>The bricks below the floor are a good indicator of when to sink underground or not.</p>
<p>I have Shadow go to the west end of the passage, leading to the other side of the second gap.</p>
<p>Our prize for clearing the area is another health boost! Finally!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>There&#39;s <strong>more</strong> to this room!?</p>
<p>This time, our starting enemies are mummies!</p>
<p>Pressing L or R, Shadow doesn&#39;t twirl a flute, or shine a sword, but their flames flash and shake brilliantly fast! It nearly gave me eye strain, so I avoid doing this...</p>
<p>Downstairs, a quartet of mummies in single file await.</p>
<p>Heading further downstairs and into a tunnel...</p>
<p>This hallway is super long!</p>
<p>At the end, more guards try to stop our progress, but they&#39;re easily gone because we have Shadow...</p>
<p>Now we see the fifth hieroglyph before us!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/t0Yfunh.png alt="tablet no 5" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We take the tablet immediately and go back to clear the area of enemies!</p>
<p>Another boost to our strength is ours!</p>
<p>We put the tablet into its place and save before taking on the last passage.</p>
<p>This is a long dungeon!</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>In the final room, we meet more mummies and security orbs!</p>
<p>With Shadow, everything feels pretty easy!</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t notice that the recess in the middle where the mummy was had a staircase...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/R01pOw0.png alt="secret stairway" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Lucky there&#39;s bricks below Shadow&#39;s feet!</p>
<p>I have Shadow go back down and sink into the floor once again.</p>
<p>Back up from another tunnel and up to a mummy crypt...</p>
<p>Downstairs, we take care of the last of the enemies in this chamber and win another health boost! We now have 39 so far! One more to go!</p>
<p>Inside the second room of this passage, we now have to face 17 more enemies!</p>
<p>Bring it on, mummies!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/fej0Emd.png alt=mummies width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Down a long staircase, two more guards remain! Finally, we&#39;ve cleared the entire Pyramid!</p>
<p>After one last defense boost, and a small doubling back trying to find the hieroglyph room, we make it!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/UuKePUT.png alt="final tablet" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Our last tablet...</p>
<p>I save before putting in the tablet at the hieroglyph room.</p>

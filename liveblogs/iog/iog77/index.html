<p>As soon as we enter the hieroglyph room, a voice calls to us!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/WnkJ6s9.png alt="go left" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We do as we&#39;re told, though I almost stray a bit, as the voice commands us to go left!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/3rYQwnU.png alt="stay there" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>What the heck!? Kara!? And I&#39;m guessing the person holding her hostage is the Jackal!!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/zLZ1rqo.png alt="the jackal" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The Jackal doesn&#39;t waste time.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/74NGLmp.png alt="been seeing ur adventures" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I&#39;m sure you do.</p>
<p><strong>Jackal:</strong> &quot;I heard about an ancient bio-technology using the comet&#39;s light. I didn&#39;t know it was you.&quot;</p>
<p>Wait, hold on, what?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ufxG9JA.png alt="power to chg shape" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Jackal:</strong> &quot;People would bow at your feet. It&#39;s only natural that King Edward would trick you into this...&quot;</p>
<p>Wait, so King Edward was...</p>
<p>Kara&#39;s in shock!</p>
<p><strong>Jackal:</strong> &quot;Yes! After all, that&#39;s the way kings are. He would do anything to get the power. He might be more evil than a mercenary like me. Heh heh.&quot;</p>
<p>What&#39;s your game, Jackal?</p>
<p>The Jackal doesn&#39;t care about what happens next. He commands us to go back with him to Edward Castle.</p>

<hr>
<p>Now the next moments are going to be surprising...I just know it.</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>A voice whispers in Will&#39;s head...</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ocbzGtE.png alt="play flute will" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Will transforms back, and I have him play his Grandma&#39;s Melody.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/zLZ1rqo.png alt="will flute" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>This moment is giving me the chills...</p>
<p>As Will finishes the last note, the trap is activated!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/rT0K5ro.png alt="goodbye jackal" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Goodbye, Jackal!</strong></p>
<p>But as he burns, his flaming corpse crawls to Kara, trying to take her with him!</p>
<p>His hand shakes violently, trying to reach Kara...oh my god...this is one determined merc!</p>
<p>Kara moves close to Will.</p>
<p><strong>Kara:</strong> &quot;Will...Why must everyone hate each other...? I...I...&quot;</p>
<p>She reels back from Will, going near the immolated corpse of the Jackal! She apologizes for being &quot;upset.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Kara:</strong> &quot;You are doing your best to save the world. At first I just wanted to find my father...But somehow it got to be a trial...But me. I don&#39;t regret coming on this journey...<strong>Let&#39;s go and find the fifth Mystic Statue...</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>I talk to Kara again, still staring at the remains.</p>
<p><strong>Kara:</strong> &quot;<strong>The melody you played became the Jackal&#39;s dirge.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;m guessing Olman might have helped save Kara and Will&#39;s life back there. Or was it Will himself, or did his Grandma save him?</p>
<p>Oh my god, what a session!</p>

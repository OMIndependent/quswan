<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>Now for the east wing to clear, I have Will change back into the Ultimate Dark Warrior, Shadow, and we&#39;re off!</p>
<p>I send the Red Jewel on its merry way to the Jeweler and have Shadow sink into the Pyramid!</p>
<p>The first chamber we enter has a huge amount of security: <strong>35</strong> enemies!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/19zHcBJ.png alt="six orbs" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>But we power through them and climb deeper into the Pyramid...</p>
<p>After taking care of the seven orbs, we come across a long downward ramp. It seems that this will be a one-way trip...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/5ZXgdOU.png alt="downward ramp" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Whoo, we&#39;re flying!</p>
<p>We climb up the stairs, where we meet our first troop of mummies!</p>
<p>After taking care of the bandaged monsters, their bandages unwrap, revealing evil, glaring specters!</p>
<p>More stairs to climb, more mummies pull out from the walls!</p>
<p>There&#39;s two stairway tunnels going up, one on each end of the passage. Which one to take?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Hq2js2T.png alt="which stairway tunnel?" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I head into the western stairway, where I&#39;m faced with more mummies and security orbs!</p>
<p>And another fleet of the living dead greet me in the next passage!</p>
<p>The mummies continue to keep mummying, with their spear guards in tow!</p>
<p>In the next room downstairs, we face a quartet of invisible heads this time!</p>
<p>I backtrack all the way to the first tomb to the eastern stairway, where a mummy and a blue portal are!</p>
<p>Our prize for clearing the entire passage is another defense boost!</p>
<p>We float to the next passage...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Ignoring the staircase...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/frpQuxh.png alt="spiked ceiling" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Yikes! Spikes!</p>
<p>Past the descending second spike ceiling, there&#39;s a small incline and a set of stairs heading down...</p>
<p>I have Shadow take to the first flight of stairs near the entrance and take care of the enemies beyond!</p>
<p>Thatâ€™s a nice hieroglyph. It seems the short one at the end might be the pharoah...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/0rEtJ27.png alt="hieroglyph painting" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I am getting lost in this dungeon, the first time that&#39;s happened in in a while, I think.</p>
<p>Looks like it&#39;s Will turn to traverse this pyramid.</p>
<p>Shadow disappears in a swirl and sparkles of light...</p>
<p>Then I realize my mistake, and change back into Shadow to sink into the hub room below...</p>
<p>Run, Will, run!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/dbenufo.png alt="will descend ramp" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The spiked ceilings still look intimidating...</p>
<p>Ah, I get caught in them! Lucky it&#39;s not an insta-death right there!</p>
<p>But as soon as I Spin Dash, more spiked ceilings await our arrival!</p>
<p>At the end of the chamber, I notice there&#39;s a way east...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/LYWZnPY.png alt="way east" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I go downstairs instead, where we see a chest, and six mummies!</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>After taking care of them, we get our attack boost and get another Red Jewel from the chest!</p>
<p>I go back to the chamber of spikes...</p>
<p>Where did the remaining two security orbs on this ramp go?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/nTxvQ1u.png alt="orbs missing" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I go eastward this time, where more spiked ceilings await!</p>
<p>This is the worst part of this dungeon!</p>
<p>As more security continue their attacks, I&#39;m now stuck in between ramps!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/dyXbLe3.png alt=stuck width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I use up one of the herbs, since we&#39;re almost low on health, and send the Red Jewel away.</p>
<p>I take care of the orbs, and finally make it to the end of the hallway!</p>
<p>But I have Will carefully go back, and take care of the floating bird heads in one part of the room before proceeding...</p>
<p>I notice that whenever Will is performing a Spin Dash, the spikes don&#39;t touch him.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/6xhZCWQ.png alt=portal width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Should I stay or should I go forward?</p>
<p>I recover and save at the hub room before heading into that passage again...</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>After that nearly painful trek, we go inside the next room...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ushne27.png alt="different litho" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The lithograph is different here this time...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/wzkHJvD.png alt="try to remove" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Another Hieroglyph Stone to take...</p>
<p>Warping back to the entrance and into the hieroglyph room, the explorer&#39;s gone!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Iwvgjah.png alt="empty room" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>It seems we only managed to retrieve two of the six lithographs so far.</p>
<p>I reread Olman&#39;s journal to see the hieroglyphs again before placing the bird lithograph into the leftmost slot.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/WV6BVTQ.png alt="bird in" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Looking at Olman&#39;s journal again, it matches the order of the lithograph we have so far.</p>
<p>The second plate we found fits the fourth hole...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/lgpksmt.png alt="six hollows" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The plates still match whatever was written in the journal...</p>
<p>Now to get the remaining four tablets...</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Rechecking the second west chamber...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/FOwJTdl.png alt="sphinx wall" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I have Shadow dissolve into the floor beneath the Sphinx hieroglyph...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/XQdrsYp.png alt="third tablet" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>...and into a tunnel, where we find our third tablet!</p>
<p>Now for tablet number four inside the third west chamber...</p>
<p>This part I did not enter before...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/yBH4O0U.png alt="floor switch" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>And there&#39;s more enemies to face too!</p>
<p>I press on the floor plate, moving the wall upward or downward to another part of the passage!</p>
<p>For every area where a floor plate is, a group of security enemies are.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a battle royale of security orbs and floating heads so far...</p>
<p>Plus, it takes awhile before our next passage approaches!</p>
<p>At the second to last part of the elevator hallway, we take care of a group of six orbs, and an attack boost is ours!</p>
<p>I check Shadow&#39;s stats before proceeding: he has 28 attack power now!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/diPYodV.png alt="elevator wall" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>This elevator wall is taking too slow...</p>
<p>One flight of stairs and a tunnel later, we get our fourth hieroglyph tablet!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/IubZzDv.png alt="fourth plate" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Here&#39;s what we have so far:</p>

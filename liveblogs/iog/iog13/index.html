<p>That felt quite easy!</p>

<p><strong>Lilly:</strong> &quot;We&#39;ve arrived. This is the Moon Tribe&#39;s home.&quot;</p>
<p>We walk around a bit, and go up the stairs. As soon as we arrive at the center, a voice greets us.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/7W4PzdV.png alt="out for a stroll?" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Oh dear...</p>
<p>Will asks to see who&#39;s speaking.</p>
<p>The voice gives us some abstract words.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/76DOYG7.png alt=abstract width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Will asks who the Moon Tribe is, and we get three choices to guess.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/mO3KMU8.png alt="choices again" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>This is a bit of a tricky decision. I select &quot;Bird Man.&quot;</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ABn2Ygr.png alt=shadows width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>And out come the Shadows, or the Moon Tribe, skull-shaped ghosts!</p>
<p>I try to go back to the village, save, and return here, but Lilly tells us to come back.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I talk to one Shadow.</p>
<p><strong>Shadow:</strong> &quot;Wherever there&#39;s light, there are shadows. We, who were changed by being bathed in the light only once...will spend our future in a world without light.&quot;</p>
<p>More prophecies from another Shadow.</p>
<p><strong>Shadow:</strong> &quot;The comet is a vehicle of destruction whose evil light has changed all creatures. It&#39;s a remnant of a weapon from a terrible battle long ago.&quot;<br>
<strong>Will:</strong> &quot;The world will be unbearable?&quot;</p>
<p>The Shadow praises Will for his observation, but the Shadow tells him he has a long way to go.</p>
<p>I talk to a third Shadow, who mentions one of their members has been taken. He asks if we &quot;know [our] destination.&quot;</p>
<p>The fourth Shadow we speak to warns us about the comet, which &quot;comes once every 800 years,&quot; with this being the fourth comet.</p>
<p><strong>Shadow:</strong> &quot;The more light that reaches you, the stronger the Dark Power.&quot;</p>
<p>The fifth Shadow tells of their tribe&#39;s history.</p>
<p><strong>Shadow:</strong> &quot;We&#39;ve transcended time and have lived long...We saw the destruction of the Incan Empire.&quot;</p>
<p>The Shadow offers the Incan statue to us, but it&#39;s located at the cave below.</p>
<p>Their &quot;laughs&quot; were probably meant to be creepy.</p>
<p>I head inside the cave, where Lilly decides to wait for us.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The Moon Tribe speaks to us.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/8ruejmw.png alt="final shape of monsters" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Shadow:</strong> &quot;They are horrible creatures whose hearts are filled with hatred and destruction.&quot;</p>
<p>We have to fight more enemies!</p>
<p>We also have to defeat them in 20 seconds!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I fail at it the first time!</p>
<p>I try to go back to Itory, but Will stops me.</p>
<p>The second try, I manage to defeat them before the time limit! Now what&#39;s next?</p>
<p>That&#39;s it! After their creepy laugh, the Moon Tribe lowers the staircase to the statue!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ETTza4Y.png alt="statue get" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Now that&#39;s statue number 2!</p>
<p>Since we have both statues, Lilly asks us if we want to go to the Incan Ruins. I say no, or rather, not yet. That&#39;s enough for one session, though it&#39;s pretty short.</p>
<p>But Lilly gives us a &quot;but thou must&quot; option. Or not, as she says that Will has to go, whether he likes it or not.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/enIdORl.png alt="father summon" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/yeN1Mf8.png alt="i don't want to fight" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>That&#39;s why I sort of like Will, he&#39;s a pacifist at heart...</p>
<p><strong>Will:</strong> &quot;You don&#39;t really understand until you lose your parents...&quot;</p>
<p>Lilly calls Will&#39;s (what she thinks) excuses &quot;typical.&quot;</p>
<p>Lilly responds with &quot;typical.&quot;</p>
<p>Now our next stop is the Incan Ruins.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/YKSEJV4.png alt="inca ruins" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>

<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/TiKIaa3.png alt="ruin entrance" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Lilly:</strong> &quot;They say that this is where the puzzle of the Incan legend is hidden. I heard this story from the Elder when I was a child...&quot;</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/OKfbBaQ.png alt=invasion width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I wonder if this story took place in an AU of Earth of sorts? The game&#39;s description says that this game&#39;s timeline&#39;s set during the Age of Exploration, or a few years after...</p>
<p><strong>Lilly:</strong> &quot;They secretly built a huge ship and filled it with priceless gold artifacts. But there&#39;s no record of the ship leaving...that&#39;s probably the Incan Gold Ship in the story.&quot;</p>
<p>The ship probably sank, I&#39;m thinking...</p>
<p><strong>Lilly:</strong> &quot;I don&#39;t think the Elder has ever told that story to any outsider. I wonder what he wants you to do...&quot;</p>
<p>We can&#39;t go back...</p>
<p>And look who snuck off to find us!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/NZG7MXw.png alt=kara width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Kara calls us &quot;mean&quot; for leaving her behind!</p>
<p>Lilly tells her that it&#39;s &quot;dangerous.&quot; I hope they don&#39;t fight again... <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Kara asks an interesting question.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/XhCUR6e.png alt="what is will looking for?" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>What is Will going to find here? His father? Or is it one clue closer to finding him?</p>
<p><strong>Kara:</strong> &quot;I can&#39;t just wait around and eat while Will is working so hard. I&#39;m waiting here for Will to return.&quot;</p>
<p>Lilly&#39;s also going to wait for Will. I seriously wish these two were party members.</p>
<p>Before we&#39;re let go, Lilly gives us one more word from the Elder. Or rather, she repeats what the Elder said to us earlier.</p>
<p><strong>Lilly:</strong> &quot;&#39;<strong>Put the statue on the Larai Cliff below the ruins, where the spirits&#39; breath cannot reach. The valley wind will lead you to the Gold Ship.</strong>&#39;&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;m now allowed to return to the village and save! Next session, we face the ruins!</p>

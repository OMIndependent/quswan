<p>I have the flame send us back to Dao.</p>
<p>Erik and Neil are gone.</p>
<p>After some long enemy hunting at the Pyramid and Angkor Wat to max out Will&#39;s lives, we go upstairs and enter the silver doorway...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/nqofuSr.png alt=doorway width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Past the doorway, we see...no, is that...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/w4hAUXc.png alt=corpse width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I knew it all along! The one speaking to Will is not his father, or is it?</p>
<p>I check the corpse.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/B8wKgoA.png alt="a familiar voice" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/tq9VITg.png alt="it's me" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Olman:</strong> &quot;My body has decayed, but I live on like this...&quot;</p>
<p>A blue flame appears before the corpse...Will is in shock...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/yk6WKRe.png alt="father why" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/_CqZv5u8hgE>The music during rest plays again. It&#39;s such a calming tune</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Olman:</strong> &quot;There&#39;s a strange room in the Tower of Babel, filled with the light of the comet. Time goes so fast there that people evolve quickly...&quot;</p>
<p>Will wonders why it’s only him and Kara that are spared from the effects of time.</p>
<p><strong>Olman:</strong> &quot;<strong>Because you two are evolved humans.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Evolved? In what way? Kara wonders that too.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Olman continues.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/lnczJgj.png alt=biotech width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Technology from the comet!?</p>
<p><strong>Olman:</strong> &quot;People freely used the power to make plants and animals. For example, they made the camel...&quot;</p>
<p>But he elaborates even further.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/zsL9FS5.png alt="demons made" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>So that&#39;s why demons and the enemies we see in the ruins existed.</p>
<p><strong>Olman:</strong> &quot;At that time, the Knights of Darkness and Light were developed to decide the fate of humanity. They are your ancestors.&quot; Oh my god...</p>
<p>More wham histories dropped...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/lLyn0QR.png alt="statues made by knights" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Olman:</strong> &quot;The six Mystic Statues were made by the Knights. The last Mystic Statue is entrusted to you.&quot; <strong>What!?</strong></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/9Wl1TOh.png alt="final statue" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>By the wording of what Olman said, I&#39;m guessing either we had the last Mystic Statue all along, or maybe he&#39;s giving it to us...</p>
<p>His words of impending doom ring out once again.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/2yGsvyF.png alt="comet coming" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Olman:</strong> &quot;By then, the two of you must go to the roof of the tower. Close your eyes...&quot;</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We&#39;re now at the tower&#39;s rooftop.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/nEUEFie.png alt="ancients comet" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Olman:</strong> &quot;Those who bathed in the comet&#39;s light were given a strange power. The comet is called a spirit, but it&#39;s an unwelcome spirit. Evolving too fast brings destruction...As long as people have evil hearts, demons will be born.&quot;</p>
<p>He tells Will to open his eyes and look around...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/54m6caF.png alt="more souls" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>More souls emerge!</p>
<p>Kara remains completely silent. She&#39;s still processing what&#39;s happening around her...</p>
<p>Oh my god, we&#39;re in space...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Wh81yOw.png alt="in space" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I speak to one of the souls, who&#39;s Neil&#39;s mother. She can see the world but can&#39;t interact with it anymore. Neil&#39;s father is in shock at what Neil is doing; he wants Neil to expand the company, not change it.</p>
<p>I talk to the next flame: it&#39;s Seth.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/jlkkopC.png alt="seth again" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>So he&#39;s truly gone...poor Seth...</p>
<p><strong>Seth:</strong> &quot;Such a world. If I could talk of this at an academy, I&#39;d be a great scholar.&quot;</p>
<p>There’s Hamlet&#39;s soul, oinking at us.</p>
<p><strong>Will:</strong> &quot;Of course. There&#39;s no difference between humans and animals...&quot;</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We talk to another soul, who&#39;s unnamed here.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/rXB0xFj.png alt=immortality width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>&quot;But is there meaning in eternal life? I felt more alive when I had a terminal disease.&quot;</p>
<p>We talk to Olman&#39;s soul once more.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/9y3NijF.png alt="time is nigh" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>So the comet is truly coming...</p>
<p>He tells the souls around him to lend Will power to destroy the comet!</p>
<p>All the souls gather into Will...</p>
<p>I speak to Kara.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/6QFEWsA.png alt=fusion width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Here we go!</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>The Knights were brought forth. The Dark Knight&#39;s ultimate power, the</strong> Firebird<strong>, was released!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Kara fuses with Will...</p>
<p>The Mystic Statues circle around Will...as he kneels down...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/TX4Fsw0.png alt="statues circle" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>He&#39;s about to transform into Shadow once again...</p>
<p>Olman&#39;s soul speaks to us again.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/uTtOMX0.png alt="fate decided here" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Olman:</strong> &quot;Now you must go to the comet!&quot;</p>

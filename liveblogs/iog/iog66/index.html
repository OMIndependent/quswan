<p>Happy holidays!</p>
<p>Continuing Angkor Wat once more now that I&#39;ve got my controller plugged in...</p>
<p>As a warm-up, I take care of a few monsters outside the temple before heading in.</p>
<p>The floating heads are still as dangerous as I remember them...</p>
<p>Back at the second passage, I have Will use a spin dash to climb up the ramp, and take on the purple floating head. It turns out the head doesn&#39;t float, but slides along the edges of the wall.</p>
<p>The more damage the head takes, the faster the head moves, like a pinball!</p>
<p>Down the stairs, we meet a rock giant and a sentinel mounted on the wall.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/hcCm0C7.png alt=sentinel width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>When I have Will attack the sentinel, it spits out green, slimy worms!</p>
<p>Another set of purple heads await. I take care of them one-by-one with caution.</p>
<p>Two mounted sentinels are blocking the way this time. After they&#39;re gone, a small duct to slide into opens up!</p>
<p>What a big mouth that wall has!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/rh4dimI.png alt="big mouth wall" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>There&#39;s three more enemies in this area...</p>
<p>Another floating head! Aaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!</p>
<p>Two rock giants are also here...</p>
<p>But they&#39;re easy to take care of, as Will gets a defense boost!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Next area, seven monsters, and two of them are those purple sliding heads again!</p>
<p>There&#39;s only one way to go from here...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/YVCfd6x.png alt="one way to go" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>But as soon as Will lands, the floor drops!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/aFrfHXz.png alt=dahkness width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Where are we?</p>
<p>The light begins to catch up...</p>
<p><strong>What are those things moving on the floor?</strong></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/wlp9hPa.png alt="what are those?" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Ignoring that, we find a nearby set of stairs and make our way back to solid flooring...</p>
<p>...to where two more floating heads wave around!</p>
<p>More floating and sliding heads later, and we end up in front of a smiling wall face...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/DxXwtJh.png alt="smiling wall face" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>There&#39;s one enemy left here, but where is that enemy?</p>
<p>I immediately notice the wall sentinel, and afterwards, win a defense boost, and the staircase back up!</p>
<p>Before going to the south pssage, I take care of a floating head and four more wall sentinels nearly taking Will&#39;s health completely!</p>
<p>But we get another health boost, increasing Will&#39;s health to 33!</p>
<p>Going east now, taking a look at the big hole that sent us down...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/vSYvQ5t.png alt="big hole" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Next chamber, two rock giants jump and unleash the might of the ceiling on us, which we manage to avoid by sliding into the small crevice!</p>
<p>Knowing they&#39;re the greater danger, I take care of the rock giants here before going after the floating heads.</p>
<p>Another small space to slide into later, and we meet another set of rock giants!</p>
<p>Going after one, the second jumps down, causing a smattering of debris to crumble down!</p>
<p>Next, wall sentinels, and a chest containing an herb!</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I haven&#39;t used the herbs yet, now that I&#39;ve got three of them...</p>
<p>I have Will go behind the place where the chest is, and use another Spin Dash to leap to the other side!</p>
<p>I&#39;m guessing that this is not going to be good...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ctFbZjF.png alt="two rock giants" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>...and I&#39;m correct, as the giants make the ceiling rain!</p>
<p>But we get another strength boost after we clear the area.</p>
<p>We return to the entrance passage, and take care of the enemies on the other side of this temple.</p>
<p>The floating and sliding heads are still the trickiest monsters here.</p>
<p>Now for the wall sentinel that we couldnt reach when we entered...</p>
<p>We open some shortcut stairs after the wall sentinel&#39;s down! Plus, we get a strength boost for clearing the area!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/5SEOo5R.png alt="shortcut stairs" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Back to the village, where I have Gaia heal Will, and we continue onwards.</p>
<p>Hamlet&#39;s eaten already...</p>

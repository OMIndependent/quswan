<p>I talk to Neil after a triple check around Angel Village.</p>
<p>Neil warns us about how hot the Floating City is...is this place in the middle of the desert?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/E1EZGKH.png alt="into watermia" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>There&#39;s a lot of turning around on the world map...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/kcYXsuH.png alt="entering watermia" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The floating city&#39;s near the ocean...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/aGgF1P3.png alt="in watermia" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Technically, the &quot;Floating City&quot; is more or less a seaside city.</p>
<p>The camera hovers around the inhabitants and scenery of <strong>Watermia</strong>.</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>We went to the Water City, Watermia. A beautiful town with houses built on rafts.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>So the rest of the gang is situated to the house up north.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/sh2SEau.png alt=townsppl width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Will&#39;s narration points out Luke&#39;s house, calling him &quot;a lovable fisherman.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Luke:</strong> &quot;I am going out in a long fishing voyage. You can use my house while I&#39;m gone.&quot;</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/AtnNa8A.png alt="gang in table" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I talk to Kara, who mentions a &quot;terrible rumor&quot; about the village.</p>
<p><strong>Kara:</strong> &quot;They play games with human lives...Freejia was the same way but beautiful. Things always have another side to them...&quot; True.</p>
<p>Lilly says Lance went to meet up to meet with &quot;someone he knew in town.&quot;</p>
<p>Erik tells us he found something outside behind Luke&#39;s house.</p>
<p>Neil has a new idea after being inspired by the raft house.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The bobbing up-and-down movement of the camera threw me off a bit. The camera&#39;s imitating the movement of the rafts.</p>
<p>Behind the ladder entrance is someone&#39;s diary. Dangit me, why am I doing this?</p>
<p>I read it.</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>After a long journey we arrive in the floating city, Watermia. I was parched after our journey. Blisters on my feet, but I wrapped them in my handkerchief.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>They mention their character development on the course of this journey. Character development yay!</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>I&#39;m pleased that I can be so concerned with someone else. I&#39;ve heard this saying from a villager. &#39;If you wish over a lotus leaf on a full moon night, your love will notice you.&#39;</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>They&#39;re thinking of trying that.</p>
<p>Luke&#39;s out on the raft outside, looking at the horizon. Shouldn&#39;t he be getting ready for his trip?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/DcJ48B3.png alt="luke take care" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>There&#39;s a horned kangaroo (or is it a horned camel? Or both?) in one of the rafts.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/3yw7Nqm.png alt="kangaroo or camel" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>In the house west of here, we find Lance, and probably his grandpa!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/jiKnE4l.png alt="lance in house" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>He asks Will if he recognizes the man in the rocking chair. The music falls silent.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/x1Zxm8q.png alt="lance's father" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>What!?</strong></p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I talk to Lance&#39;s father. What is he doing here in Watermia?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/N5u0qK2.png alt="went w olman" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I talk to Lance again.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/eCrtTrP.png alt="memory loss" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>So Lance&#39;s father has amnesia!?</p>
<p><strong>Lance:</strong> &quot;I finally met my lost father, but...&quot;</p>
<p>As we turn to leave, Lance comes along.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/3BPYSnG.png alt="finish necklace" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>He wants to finish the necklace before Lilly&#39;s 15th comes around...</p>
<p>Lance heads back to Luke&#39;s.</p>
<p>I walk around the lilypads to talk to twins, where one of them mentions another real life landmark, along with snakes being there.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/SD5qwRD.png alt="snakes twins" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I continue walking around to talk to more townspeople.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/BZirKdG.png alt="sand fanger" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The Sand Fanger&#39;s fluid is medicine for most diseases, he says.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/4IkX4Tx.png alt="lotus leaf will come" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>A Lotus Leaf, huh? But where&#39;s the gambling house?</p>
<p>The inhabitants in a nearby house mention Lance&#39;s father, who know about his travels with Will&#39;s famous father.</p>
<p>From one of the citizens, they built rafts as part of the city because they &quot;love to move around.&quot;</p>
<p>The &quot;kangaroo-camel with horns&quot; I mentioned earlier has an in-universe name: a Kruk.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/vHkSMUx.png alt=kruk width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The Kruk is a desert crosser.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>East of here is the gambling house.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/VIJfDO2.png alt="gambling house ext" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I head inside, where there&#39;s a beer drinking contest going on. I find a <strong>Red Jewel</strong> in one of the vases in the northeast corner!</p>
<p>The battle music&#39;s playing. Looks like it&#39;s serious business in the gamble house.</p>
<p>One man tells us that there&#39;s money in a raft outside of the gambling house.</p>
<p>A woman tells us not to waste life on gambling.</p>
<p>The next man I speak to is our good friend, the Jeweler Gem!</p>
<p>We need 5 more Red Jewels.</p>
<p>Counting the one we have, we now need 4 more Red Jewels for the next prize.</p>
<p>The participants are almost at their limit...</p>
<p>Watermians use the seawater as their drinking, washing, and cooking water.</p>
<p>A lady across the gambling place tells us more about water&#39;s constant, changing movement.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/JMsq8DG.png alt="water moves" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The house behind her has this town&#39;s Dark Space portal!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/VWYdiMA.png alt="dark space" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I save here before heading out again.</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>There&#39;s a man on a lilypad, who tells us to wait for another one. He has all that room to himself there...</p>
<p>I find another Red Jewel in one of the vases near the woman.</p>
<p>I go back to the area of the gambling house, around to the right side, and find a lilypad to cross into parts unknown...</p>
<p>Where will this lilypad take us?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ek16dLD.png alt=lilypad width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>A fisherman tells us about another game. A &quot;most dangerous&quot; one.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/j0P1W6G.png alt="russian glass" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>As soon as I get off the lilypad to go back, it leaves us behind!</p>
<p>It comes back, but after waiting awhile, it&#39;s still not moving...</p>
<p>The fisherman also lands in the lily pad with us!</p>
<p>I seem to have found a bug...</p>
<p>...but with some maneuvering, I manage to make the lilypad take us back!</p>
<p>A child named Sabas mentions his father...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/n2D3Bo1.png alt=sabas width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>His older sister, Nana, mentions their father&#39;s been away for half a year now on his trip to the Incan Ruins...</p>
<p>Poor them. <img class=emojione alt=â˜¹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>A local fisherman says Lance&#39;s father came to Watermia two years ago.</p>
<p>I stop my session here for tonight!</p>

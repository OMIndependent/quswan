<p>What could we find here?</p>
<p>Wait. Maybe the vampires are waiting for us to get the Mystic Statue. If it&#39;s here, they&#39;ll know we have it and then they&#39;ll try to take it from us.</p>
<p>I decide to spring the trap, and find the statue.</p>
<p>I speak to the statue head.</p>

<p><strong>Rama:</strong> &quot;<strong>I am Rama, King of Mu.</strong> My body passed on long ago, but my spirit lives on. If you look closely, you can see wandering spirits.&quot;</p>
<p>The spirits begin to appear!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/zt5IrrR.png alt="spirits appear" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I talk to one spirit, who mentions a &quot;single ray of light... from the sky.&quot; They called it &quot;the light of the spirits.&quot; I&#39;m thinking that&#39;s the comet...</p>
<p>Another mentions what happened to the citizens of Mu. Different fates from turning to stone, to turning thin, to turning into water. So the enemies we&#39;ve been attacking were once Mu&#39;s population.</p>

<p>Oh my god...</p>
<p>One spirit mentions almost everyone gave in. Others decided to leave Mu. But there were no other places that they knew where to go to. Plus, they couldn&#39;t make a boat, as Mu was an island made of stone.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/qLWXZie.png alt="undersea tunnel" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>So the Seaside Palace was actually created by the people of Mu...</p>
<p>So that means Sam and his brothers used to live in this island.</p>
<p>We speak to Rama again.</p>
<p><strong>Rama:</strong> &quot;The underwater tunnel dug by man is inside. Please take this <strong>Mystic Statue</strong>.&quot;</p>
<p>A flash of light, and a tunnel appears behind Rama!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/QQoIgTg.png alt="mystic statue get" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>That&#39;s three statues, three to go.</p>
<p>Rama&#39;s gone, as are the spirits.</p>
<p>I save again before going inside, knowing we&#39;ll be facing the vampires next.</p>

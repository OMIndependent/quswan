<p>It&#39;s Freedan time!</p>
<p>After taking care of a few slimes, I have Gaia heal us and proceed.</p>
<p>Now where to go?</p>
<p>I head south, and avoid the obstacle to go to the next area, where we meet more enemies in the way!</p>
<p>I see another one of those blue pulsing rings...and a steep blue ramp. At the top is a sleeping rock giant.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/XNyWoAB.png alt=ramp width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I use the ring to suddenly build up speed...</p>
<p>...but I&#39;m figuring out how to get the giant from blocking our way. I use Freedan&#39;s fireball, waking the giant up!</p>
<p>After taking care of the giant, I finally make it!</p>
<p>Our old nemesis, the ever evasive phantom, is no match for Freedan!</p>
<p>Heading west now, to the area where we picked up the Statue of Hope.</p>
<p>I see another Dark Space portal in this area.</p>
<p>Up north, another slime to take care of, and another small crevice here...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Vr9AKRv.png alt="small crevice" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Back down, and southwards, as I enter a wide maze. I press the button nearby, lowering the spikes! I wonder if it&#39;s timed...</p>
<p>It is, as I go back, press the button and dash past the spike pit as quickly as possible!</p>
<p>I wonder what these crevices, or tunnels are for? But I worry about that later as a phantom teleports in!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/d3tNbsA.png alt="another crevice" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I head west, where more slimes and those flashing stretchable pillars of light await!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Yu8y3rn.png alt=pillars width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Northwards, where we&#39;re almost close to the next Dark Space portal!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/1BthFHX.png alt="another dark space portal" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Brushing one slime aside, I enter in. Let&#39;s see what&#39;s new...</p>
<p>There&#39;s a glowing ball of light in front of Will...looks like someone&#39;s getting a new Dark Power!</p>
<p>Will gains the Slider move. Gaia explains the move to us.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/CW9b95w.png alt="sliding attack" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>So those small crevices we saw earlier are meant for that new move, huh? In a way, it&#39;s similar to Dust&#39;s Sliding Move.</p>
<p>I approach Gaia for more healing and additional advice on Will&#39;s new power.</p>
<p><strong>Gaia:</strong> &quot;Be careful not to overlook the cracks in the cliff.&quot;</p>
<p>Outside, I demo Will&#39;s new move!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/TBqV8mS.png alt="will's new move" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I show off a few times escaping those flashing pillars in one of the mini mazes.</p>
<p>At the previous area, I use the move in front of the crevice!</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>After crossing, the slime above us makes a squirting sound!</p>
<p>Seeing a steep ramp ahead, I go west to a dead end to get the pulsing ring, and use the flute to move it before the ramp!</p>
<p>A set of rocks south blocks our way in taking care of the enemies there.</p>
<p>Northwards, more enemies show themselves!</p>
<p>I scale the area counter-clockwise and...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/zsUNr1H.png alt="rock giants" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Hoo boy...</p>
<p>I take on the rock giants one by one while avoiding the dangerous obstacle. It&#39;s a tense match, as I&#39;m nearly low on health again!</p>
<p>After taking care of the gray drops here, a statue appears!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/E6K5Y1V.png alt="statue head yay" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>At the south end of the area, I meet up with a pair of spikes!</p>
<p>We finally make it to the center of this area!</p>
<p>After the rock giant&#39;s taken care of, another statue, facing eastward, appears!</p>
<p>I get our boost, a strength boost, before figuring out where the next Statue of Hope is.</p>
<p>It takes a while to find the spot (there&#39;s no sparkle to make it easier), but we get the second Statue!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/X91GI4C.png alt="second statue" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>In a flash, I dash back to the first area using the small crevice as our shortcut!</p>
<p>The next statue is placed! The spectres appear once more, saying the same lines as before...</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Thanks to our efforts, the sea waters are almost receding!</p>
<p>I quickly get another Red Jewel from a chest in a previously flooded area, and slide back through the crevice.</p>
<p>A phantom spots us, but we make careful work of them...</p>
<p>Unfortunately, another phantom sees us and we take a few beams of their magic!</p>
<p>A lot of phantoms are appearing now. Apparently, they&#39;re not too happy to see us.</p>
<p>Ah, dang spikes and phantom magic!</p>
<p>I recover quickly at Gaia&#39;s interdimensional house and transform into Freedan again.</p>
<p>I suddenly realize I need to transform back into Will again...</p>
<p>On the way to next Dark Space portal, more phantoms keep warping to our location!</p>
<p>For some reason, I can&#39;t transform back into Will in this Dark Spce portal...</p>
<p>I clear out the last enemies in the canyon below, and get a health boost! Now that&#39;s 20!</p>
<p>Northwards, we&#39;re back at the first area, where I take care of the remaining enemies again, and get another health boost!</p>
<p>What&#39;s inside the chest?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/5mo4B0Y.png alt="rama statue 1" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Rama&#39;s Statue! Now all we have to do is to find where to place this...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/H61Ivwg.png alt="statue menu" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The statue looks like a golden idol.</p>
<p>It&#39;s mostly smooth sailing from here, as we enter the large tunnel...</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/oBUXOfG.png alt=pedestals width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>This might be the place where we need to put Rama&#39;s Statue.</p>
<p>But, feeling like I&#39;m missing something, I turn back.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/k1HxKFK.png alt="two rock giants & chest" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I end up in front of two rock giants guarding a chest. This might be where either an herb or another statue is.</p>
<p>Waking up a rock giant feels like waking up an Iron Knuckle.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s see what&#39;s inside...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/KyuV8KT.png alt="rama statue 2" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Knowing there&#39;s two pedestals, I&#39;m guessing we have the entire statue!</p>
<p>Traveling around the land of Mu can be quite confusing. Not enough to make me lost, though. Even when I dash, it feels too vast to get through.</p>
<p>I change back into Will and find the remaining enemies here.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/qKBu7z3.png alt=slimes width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Now let&#39;s see what boost we get...a defensive boost!</p>
<p>Two saves and tons of circling around later, we make it back to the shrine of Rama.</p>
<p>After placing the two Rama statues, the whole room begins to warp! What&#39;s going on!?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/XlqWuUP.png alt="burial ground" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>So we&#39;re at a graveyard for the citizens of Mu. But who buried them if there&#39;s no one alive here?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/YRMUaWb.png alt="large statue head" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The lone statue head at the north end stands out compared to the many ordinary markers here.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s see what&#39;s changed outside...no changes.</p>
<p>I save again. Save early and often!</p>

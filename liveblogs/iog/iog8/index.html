<p>We&#39;re now in our first dungeon!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/zFBOXmz.png alt="first room" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Unfortunately, Will doesn&#39;t have a weapon equipped, only a melody to hum...</p>
<p>Just like what Gaia said, when I press start, I see a display of the enemies I need to take care of...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ID0KwHN.png alt="enemies on screen" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Three Bats, but no weapon.</p>
<p>In the next room, where the prompt tells us that we&#39;re officially inside the &quot;inescapable&quot; Underground Tunnel...</p>
<p>There&#39;s 15 monsters here in this tunnel.</p>
<p>By pressing A, or circle, I can attack the Bats! I return to the previous room and take care of the monsters there.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/KScFM61.png alt="bat hit" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>They usually take two to three hits from Will&#39;s Flute to go down!</p>
<p>After taking care of the Bats here, I win a prize!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/7khaifd.png alt="heart orb yay!" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>It&#39;s a Health upgrade!</p>
<p>Will tells us the same thing Gaia said: if we take care of the monsters in one area, we win a Jewel!</p>
<p>Now to the next room...</p>
<p>A fireball tried to hit us as we go up the stairs to the other side of the canal, but it missed!</p>
<p>The fireball thrower&#39;s a green Dianoga-like monster in the water!</p>
<p>As soon as we take care of him, a shining light ascends and breaks through a cage, where a Skeleton is!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/8Fk4gBl.png alt="skeleton attack" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Now we continue as we have seven more enemies left in the tunnel...</p>
<p>I seem to do a lunge attack everytime I have Will dash.</p>
<p>A lunge attack delivers twice the damage to an enemy!</p>
<p>After I take care of the last monster, another Dianoga-like crawly, Will gets another Jewel, and a Strength boost this time!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>In the next room, we come across our first hurdle!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/wCDtgd8.png alt="statue head" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Not a problem...</p>
<p>There&#39;s a fluttering fairy (?) near the statue. Everytime I strike them with Will&#39;s flute, they respond...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/QuO8yZy.png alt="what r u doing?" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We pull the statues away and continue our escape.</p>
<p>The fairy seems to say something else to us as they fly away, but I miss it.</p>
<p>I find out the map only shows the surrounding enemies, not everyone in the area. Plus, I see there&#39;s treasure here.</p>
<p>Spiked balls make their return. I hope there isn&#39;t any complex puzzles in this game too.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/JcaHZW7.png alt="spiked balls" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>And as I take care of a Dianoga monster, Will takes his first hit!</p>
<p>I clear the rest, and Will grows ever more stronger!</p>
<p>I hit the red button, moving the spiked balls...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/gTCgLiU.png alt=switch width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Oooo, I wonder what&#39;s inside?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/mAlC9HW.png alt="treasure chest" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>As I recall Fidget&#39;s advice, I smash the chest open, or I approach it.</p>
<p>This <strong>Herb</strong>&#39;s going to be very useful...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/QfS0kXF.png alt="herb item get" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Into the next room, where after taking care of Dianoga monsters, another surprise awaits!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/V3fJ9GT.png alt="spears fall" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>If Grandpa Bill designed this part of the maze too...</p>
<p>More stairs to climb...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Qoa6WyL.png alt="spiked balls" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>A spear drops before the west exit! Treading carefully...</p>
<p>The red switch can&#39;t be pressed because it&#39;s &quot;rusty&quot;...</p>
<p>I head up, take care of more monsters there, and drop down to press that rusty button! A doorway opens, but I sweep the whole area of monsters before going in...</p>
<p>Up top, there&#39;s a Bat of a different color, with his four minions flying in formation!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/AAMM36w.png alt="red bat" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The red Bat takes slightly longer to take care of, but I do it, opening another doorway forward!</p>
<p>I use up the Herb from earlier, knowing Will&#39;s health is almost gone...</p>
<p>And now for the rest of the monsters here...</p>
<p>...and Will wins another Jewel!</p>
<p>Let&#39;s see what&#39;s in this tunnel here...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/oAWuwz1.png alt="what's in tunnel" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Inside is another chest, and a will-o-wisp (probably a prisoner&#39;s soul or Gaia herself?) in the corner. The wisp gives us more advice, mentioning <strong>Dark Gems.</strong></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/yI3qes8.png alt="dark gems they are" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>So that&#39;s what those small red things were! I thought they were money...</p>
<p>He adds that if we collect 100 of those Dark Gems, we get more health!</p>
<p>His last message is slightly encouraging, but still ominous.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/yt3zln4.png alt="you won't have to go very far" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We open the chest, and pick up our first Red Jewel!</p>
<p>We see the fairy, who runs and hides inside a dancing rose!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/F12emrK.png alt="dancing rose" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I&#39;m betting like in <em>Soul Blazer</em>, this rose can talk.</p>
<p>I check the menu first to see our reward, the Red Jewel&#39;s warm flame blazing in its core.</p>
<p>The rose gives out another tip.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/A1eJFxX.png alt="rose tip" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I hit the button, which bumps back up again.</p>
<p>So Grandma&#39;s melody is our next try. It works!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/1JZV3CI.png alt="will plays flute" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The tune&#39;s a bit calming, just like Grandma said.</p>
<p>Now something&#39;s happened, as someone gives us more advice.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/vVNYJu2.png alt="go to other side" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Will dashes to the other side.</p>
<p><strong>Voice:</strong> &quot;The door won&#39;t open unless you push this switch on the count of three. When I shout, push the switch. I&#39;ll count 1, 2, 3. Don&#39;t make a mistake.&quot;</p>
<p>The countdown begins!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/oRqdkun.png alt=countdown width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I fail the first time, though, as the voice tells I have to push <strong>both</strong> switches at the same time. Is that a translation error?</p>
<p>As soon as the display says 3, we hit the switch! It&#39;s all a matter of reflexes with this puzzle!</p>
<p>Now our ticket forward is open.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/O6R9Yhu.png alt="door to next area" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>But, I have a feeling there might be a boss coming up...</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>No boss yet, thank goodness.</p>
<p>However, there are 22 monsters to take care of in this area.</p>
<p>Four green Dianogas! Aaaah!</p>
<p>After taking care of the west flank, a flash of light destroys the blocks in the middle, and opens a door to Dark Space!</p>
<p>There&#39;s also someone new there!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/7EZ2Rf3.png alt=statue width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>It&#39;s a statue of a man with a sword. I have Will approach him.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/4JcBwSL.png alt="long time" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Long time?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/XXAEwL8.png alt="i am freedan" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Freedan:</strong> &quot;Let me help you on your journey. As time goes by, you&#39;ll come to understand my nature...&quot;</p>
<p>Now what&#39;s happening to Will? What is Freedan doing?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/00szWs7.png alt=transformation width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Oh my god!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/0UeO3UC.png alt="freedan now" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>As I control Freedan now, I talk to Gaia, who gives out more advice.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ob7dep1.png alt="temporary form" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>So this is more like a superhero form for Will of sorts, hmm?</p>
<p>I save and head back to the tunnel once more.</p>
<p><a name=6></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I wonder what Freedan&#39;s style of fighting is like?</p>
<p>I proceed to take care of the green Dianogas...Now that&#39;s quick fighting!</p>
<p>I head back into Dark Space, where the statue of Freedan has been replaced by a running Will.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/YYU5od5.png alt="will statue" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Now to transform back into Will...</p>
<p>But I&#39;m stuck, as I can&#39;t reach the button, and transform back into the &quot;Dark Knight&quot; Freedan.</p>
<p>Freedan&#39;s sword is long enough to reach the bridge button, and we can cross forward.</p>
<p>The next monster we face is no ordinary Skeleton. After we take care of it, a floating skull&#39;s left, and he&#39;s a quick one!</p>
<p>We continue our escape, still as Freedan, but another floating skull stops our progress short! Dangit!</p>
<p>I&#39;m now back at Will&#39;s prison cell...</p>
<p>...and I have to fight the monsters again! Plus, like in <em>Soul Blazer</em>, all of the Dark Gems that I collected are now gone!</p>
<p>Time to reclaim them back!</p>
<p>In the second Dark Space, I learn that Gaia can also heal wounds! Thank you, Gaia!</p>
<p>What a fun session tonight was!</p>

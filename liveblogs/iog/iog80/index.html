<p>We&#39;re flying again, yes!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/TrnI12g.png alt="plane ride" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The journey there seems slightly long...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/aOx9rRB.png alt="tower of babel" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>...but we make it!</p>
<p>Neil&#39;s now flying over the tower.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ofVFgQE.png alt="say hello to olman" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Hopefully, we&#39;ll meet Olman soon. Will sends Neil his thank yous.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/uJaAAcQ.png alt="will thanks" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Erik misses Will already, and tells him to go back to South Cape after Will&#39;s done reuniting with his father.</p>
<p><strong>Will:</strong> &quot;Thank you. I&#39;m glad we all made the trip together.&quot;<br>
<strong>Erik:</strong> &quot;On this trip, everyone found something. Lance met Lilly and found his lost father. Neil decided to take over his parents&#39; company. Kara started to really live, and saw a world outside the castle. I&#39;m going to excuse myself.&quot;</p>
<p>And Erik also has his personal character development too. Character development, yay!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/W8PPuDM.png alt=bathroom width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Neil:</strong> &quot;Ha ha ha. Just like Erik.&quot;</p>
<p>But Neil notices something too.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/RXpw9Aw.png alt="kara said nothing" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Neil:</strong> &quot;I won&#39;t see Will for a long time. I&#39;ll say goodbye to him.&quot; And soon, for me, to this game too...</p>
<p><strong>Kara:</strong> &quot;Hmmm. Right...&quot;</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Neil sees Babel in the distance.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/YGBjK5q.png alt="ready parachute" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Here we go!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/dCu71FU.png alt="parachute jump" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Will:</strong> &quot;I hadn&#39;t been there in a year and a half...&quot;</p>
<p>Now Will&#39;s back at the tower.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/8MJI8lf.png alt="tower of babel quiet" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/HhUCf6x.png alt="tower entrance" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Forward into the hallway, no monsters yet.</p>
<p>But we find golden statues of Freedan, and an empty pedestal.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/HrI6jRi.png alt=pedestal width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>So the flute was taken from that pedestal...</p>
<p>Our next obstacle is a spike pit, which Will easily sidles through...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/tznNtoj.png alt="spike pit" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The next passage is blocked by these lasers...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/tDJpnPF.png alt="laser blocked" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Will tries to go forward, but is zapped!</p>
<p>But something drops to the floor!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/iQZTkzq.png alt="crystal ring" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Ah, so this is how that King and the Jackal were tracking us, I&#39;m guessing.</p>
<p>Or maybe not?</p>
<p><strong>Will:</strong> &quot;I thought it was a decoration, but it had been hidden there...&quot;</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/tCFB3xm.png alt="crystal ring item" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>So the Ring that the King was looking for was hidden in the flute all along? Oh my god...</p>
<p>Who put that there?</p>
<p>I have Will equip the ring and we phase forward the lasers.</p>
<p>As we cross thru the hallway, someone&#39;s voice stops us...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/6sry1XY.png alt=wait width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>It&#39;s Kara!</p>
<p>So she&#39;s going to stay with us till the end, huh?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/LkVkHzA.png alt=sorry width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Will asks why Kara came along to the tower, and without the Crystal Ring.</p>
<p><strong>Kara:</strong> &quot;Could that be the ring...Didn&#39;t you find it in the Incan Gold Ship?&quot;</p>
<p>Will tells her the crystal on the ring is dark blue, not solid gold.</p>
<p>Plus, Kara has a ring with a light blue gem on it. Maybe that&#39;s why she was able to get in to the tower...</p>
<p><strong>Will:</strong> &quot;A light one and a dark one...&quot;</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/aFsyXhb.png alt="don't leave" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Now Kara tags along for the journey! Lucky there&#39;s no enemies yet...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/iS8Djyy.png alt="kara tags along" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>On our way forward, we come across another sculpture of Freedan.</p>
<p>A blue flame is nearby and speaks to us about the comet.</p>
<p>&quot;The light released from the comet has a profound effect on the growth of living things. When the star nears Earth&#39;s orbit, all living things experience a dramatic evolution...&quot;</p>
<p>After passing by a Freedan statue, more blue flames appear, explaining the comet, and evolution.</p>
<p>The comet that&#39;s coming &quot;is a demon of stars...&quot;</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/oJX6Abs.png alt="beyond imagination" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>That sounds a bit foreboding...</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We climb more stairs...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Eu5otHo.png alt="time is different" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Meaning that a number of years outside might be minutes, or seconds, inside the tower? Oh dear...</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>You&#39;re not normal human beings, because you can live here.</strong>&quot; What did the flame mean by that?</p>
<p>The next flame warns us about the room next to it.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ntctdtx.png alt=demons width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Looks like there&#39;s going to be more enemies to fight here!</p>
<p>On the right of the doorway, we see another Dark Space gate!</p>
<p>Beyond that is another Freedan statue, and the way up is barred by laser.</p>
<p>I save for now.</p>

<p>I notice on the file select screen that the map moves to the current location Will is in depending on which file, or diary, I&#39;ve selected. It&#39;s a nice detail there.</p>
<p>At the menu, the Incan statues&#39; eyes glow eerily.</p>
<p>I select one of them and the prompt comes up, giving us the hint the Elder told us.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/cBTNI8x.png alt="statue tip" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Okay, time to face those ruins!</p>
<p>After talking to Kara and Lilly, we make our way into the cave!</p>
<p>We&#39;re now at the <strong>Larai Cliff</strong>, before the entrance to those ruins!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Wn1pF2A.png alt="larai cliff" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/-H7waJPFd78>Here&#39;s the music for the area.</a></p>
<p><strong>Will:</strong> &quot;There&#39;s a tremendous wind at the Larai Cliff. That&#39;s probably what the [Elder] meant by the breath of the spirits...this is the cliff with no wind. My heart beats fast.&quot;</p>
<p>So the wind, in a way, isn&#39;t coming from the wind, but rather, from the spirits of these ruins.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Ojnho7f.png alt="spirit head" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Inside the next tunnel, where walking mudmen roam the ruin!</p>
<p>Moving forward, there&#39;s also a spinning cylinder of faces that can shoot darts if it sees us!</p>
<p>They can also be taken care of too...</p>
<p>Down the steps, as more spinning faces await on the sides of the end of the stairs.</p>
<p>But I avoid their darts and empty the chamber of enemies!</p>
<p>South of the area, where the doorway to the next room is, I see a pit of spikes! Yikes!</p>
<p>I get a defense boost as a reward for clearing out the area!</p>
<p>I take off to the western room...</p>
<p>...where there are 17 enemies!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>More creepy-crawly roly-polies to clear out here...</p>
<p>That&#39;s seriously a long way down...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/JrabKfQ.png alt="long way down" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I climb up the blue ramp, no good. It&#39;s a one-way trip.</p>
<p>I take the stairs near the entrance to this area, and fetch more gems, gaining an additional life!</p>
<p>Circling around the area, and taking care of more mud monsters and spinning faces as I go...</p>
<p>Last monster gone, and I get a health boost!</p>
<p>Plus, the quick way back opens up!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/fgUPrzh.png alt="quick way opens" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Back outside now...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/rJBXyW3.png alt="chest what inside?" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Opening the chest, we get...a <strong>diamond-shaped block</strong>. </p>
<p>I wonder what this could be used for? Maybe it&#39;s for the diamond-shaped slot on the floor we saw earlier. Maybe if we put this in, it could lower the spikes...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>These three pedestals probably might be important...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/jmzLkpu.png alt=pedestals width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We go back to the room and place the diamond on the recess in the floor!</p>
<p>With a little bit of shaking going on, a set of platforms drop on top of the spikes!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ztEuCVk.png alt="platforms lower" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Outside at the cliffs again, we climb down the ladder, as we see more monsters!</p>
<p>Eastwards we go!</p>
<p>With another ladder to climb down to, I check the map. The majority of the enemies here are located down below us.</p>
<p>Inside the second floor of the cliff ruins, I notice a skeleton.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Eq5vlBG.png alt=explorer? width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Will notices a charm on the skeleton&#39;s hand, and inside the charm is a note: &quot;<strong>Father, please come back alive. Nana.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>So this man was a father, huh?</p>
<p>Another reads: &quot;<strong>When you find the Gold Ship, buy a Kruk. Sabas.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Up the stairs we go, where we find more statues...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/1ZHVZ6K.png alt=statues width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>These statues flash when Will hits them. Maybe Dashing past them could work...</p>
<p>I try moving them with Will&#39;s flute, which pulls them closer to us...</p>
<p>I have Will Dash next, destroying some of them!</p>
<p>Opening the chest here gives us another <strong>Herb!</strong></p>
<p>Now I&#39;m stuck again...</p>
<p>But I also learn that by twirling the flute, I can pull gems over to Will!</p>
<p>I try and see if there&#39;s any way of crossing to the other side of the blocks in this maze.</p>
<p>I wonder if the statues are the key to going forward?</p>
<p>With no luck, I head back outside and see an opening, which I have Will jump down from!</p>
<p>This is probably where we need to go next...and it is!</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I take care of more spinning faces flanking the perch.</p>
<p>Down more stairs, I have Will tackle out another cracked statue blocking our way!</p>
<p>Another strength boost for Will, yes!</p>
<p>Down into the basement of the cliff&#39;s ruins, where slimes form from the floor!</p>
<p>I check around the perch before sliding down the west ramp.</p>
<p>Now a spinning statue head rises from its pedestal and runs circles around us, with more slimes as backup!</p>
<p>Outside again, we come across another explorer who couldn&#39;t finish the trip...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/W0pi0BN.png alt="move gold statue" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>After accidentally jumping down back to the previous part of the ruin, I head inside the next room.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/eQeu6bZ.png alt="gold statues" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Checking the map, these gold statues are also enemies too.</p>
<p>And one of them comes to life!</p>
<p>The warrior shoots fire at us from his spear!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/GQZX2vL.png alt="warrior shooting fire" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I am not too comfortable with the unfortunate implications of this enemy...</p>
<p>He also has a lot of health too!</p>
<p>Stepping on one of the gold tiles, a prompt tells us each one makes a sound, and that they activate something when all four are pushed at the same time. I realize that we might need those statues to go forward into the next room.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they awaken whenever I get close to them...</p>
<p>Oh, wait a minute!</p>
<p><a name=6></a></p>
<hr>
<p>When I use Will&#39;s flute, they move like any other statue!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/YnZTDij.png alt="move statue" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I carefully move the statues to the golden tiles...</p>
<p>I mess up on the first try.</p>
<p>I decide to move the top statues first...</p>
<p>I&#39;ve now placed three statues on the tiles so far. The last one&#39;s going to be tricky to move without waking up the others...</p>
<p>And we open the door! Easy!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Ay90Vt1.png alt="doors open" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Down the corridors we go...</p>
<p>...And we meet another failed explorer who fell for a trap. I have to avoid stepping on the gold tiles in this room.</p>
<p>Now a pit of spikes block our way. Maybe I should press on at least one of the tiles...</p>
<p>The leftmost one here lowers a platform to cross over the spike pit!</p>
<p>I&#39;m running low on health too. Lucky we have two Herbs!</p>
<p>After crossing two more spike pits and taking care of more enemies, we finally make it to a Dark Space doorway!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/htybykB.png alt="dark space door" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Freedan&#39;s also here too!</p>
<p>I save and stop my session here.</p>

<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/dVoHUjF.png alt="letter arrives" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Yes! The letter&#39;s from Grandma Grandma and Grandpa Bill! Plus, we also get <strong>Will&#39;s father&#39;s journal</strong>!</p>
<p>The snake charmer tells us that the house were staying at is a hotel.</p>
<p>I have Will read the letter.</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Have you been OK? Neil told us that he was in Dao, so I&#39;m sending this letter. I heard the reason why. Grandpa and I are looking forward to seeing you. When we looked in your father&#39;s luggage, we found a journal written about the Pyramid.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>This is interesting...</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>I thought it would help you, so I sent it along. Take care.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Now I read Olman&#39;s journal.</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>I&#39;ve deciphered the hieroglyphs. No one has ever done it before. It says there&#39;s a key to solving the riddle of human history in the Pyramid.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/HtqsM7A.png alt=hieroglyph width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>&quot;<strong>The first part says, &#39;</strong>The Sun Spirit rises from the horizon.<strong>&#39; I went to the Pyramid and found the same inscription. So...</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>A page of the journal is torn out.</p>
<p>Probably we might find more when we get into the Pyramid.</p>
<p>I go inside the carpet-weaving house, and talk to the man with the cane.</p>
<p>He explains that these carpets take nearly four decades to complete...</p>
<p>What he tells us next is quite shocking.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/rmTOUkH.png alt="woman worked" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Oh my god...</p>
<p>His next remark is also quite chilling: &quot;Remember, little man. Some are born to misfortune.&quot;</p>
<p>I try my hand at the whack-a-snake minigame again.</p>
<p>The charmer&#39;s impressed by our score: 58 snakes!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/6Xsau3k.png alt="two red jewels" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>He sends the two Red Jewels to the Jeweler, meaning we have <strong>31</strong> so far!</p>
<p>Now that we have over 30 Red Jewels, Freedan&#39;s Dark Power increases!</p>
<p>We&#39;ve nearly crossed out every prize on the list except for the Jeweler&#39;s secrets. Since we missed some, however, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll get to see the Jeweler&#39;s secrets.</p>

<p>Since I have extra time tonight, I decide to play on and see what happens next...</p>
<p>One of the young villagers is gazing to the northeast. He&#39;s asking for the map, but I don&#39;t give it to him just yet.</p>
<p>He looks lonely... <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Kara tells us she learned one new word in the villagers’ language.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/29VlEBu.png alt=ramapoe width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Ramapoe</strong>&quot;...</p>
<p>Erik states the condition of the village now.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/VvfGsPE.png alt="lost so many" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog> </p>
<p>Erik wonders how they managed to survive.</p>
<p>I have Will talk to one of the villagers.</p>
<p>I&#39;m asked if I could stare back at him. I say no.</p>
<p>I take one of the villagers&#39; hands walking around the Hamlet bonfire. We seem to agree, according to the prompt.</p>
<p>Poor them...</p>
<p>Will sniffs. Is he crying for Hamlet?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/OdlFNGy.png alt=snort width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Will:</strong> &quot;The air is filled with the aroma of roasting Hamlet.&quot;</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>One of the men offers food for us. I have Will try it.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/A5hj0ZI.png alt=dumplings width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Eeee...</p>
<p><strong>Will:</strong> &quot;My heart was filled. It seemed as if we understood each other.&quot;</p>
<p>I have Will stare at one of the villagers.</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>The man seems to look right into your heart...we don&#39;t understand each other&#39;s language but a seed has sprouted...</strong>&quot; I wonder if he sensed that we knew Sam and his brothers?</p>
<p>One of the boys wants to lead us somewhere. But not yet.</p>
<p>I save before I talk to the first boy.</p>
<p>The first boy draws our next location on the map: <strong>Angkor Wat</strong>!</p>
<p>My PS3 controller&#39;s out of power now, so I use the keyboard.</p>
<p>The boy wants to take us to the temple. He senses that we need the Mystic Statue there.</p>
<p>Talking to the second boy, he leads us to a nearby skeleton...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/hAHrTYM.png alt="skeleton famine" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s his father, or a friend. </p>
<p>It <strong>is</strong> someone he knew, and he starts crying... <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>

<p>Time to face Angkor Wat!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/JOaZ8Af.png alt="angkor wat map" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We appear before the gates of the temple. The place has scattered shrubbery around...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/COnuz3D.png alt="door to angkor wat" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Will:</strong> &quot;Through the jungle, three days journey from the native village, there is a huge temple.&quot;</p>
<p>We survey around the perimeter, and see a bush crawling superfast!</p>
<p>Knowing it&#39;s an enemy, I have Will take care of it!</p>
<p>Next enemies are a fly, and an invincible colossus strongman with a long, extendable neck!</p>
<p>There&#39;s more enemies around the outside of the temple!</p>
<p>I figure out how to beat the colossus! After taking out the head when it&#39;s stretched, their weak point, a big eye, is exposed! They run in fright afterwards!</p>
<p>The decor of the overhang here looks a bit intricate.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/qu4Wtsn.png alt=overhang width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We explore around the outside a bit more, and take care of the remaining enemies here.</p>
<p>Our health is now up to 32!</p>
<p>It turns out the colossi&#39;s &quot;heads&quot; are their mouths, and those mouths remind me of Xenomorphs for some reason...eeee...</p>

<hr>
<p>Inside Angkor Wat proper, where <a href=https://youtu.be/57hzpBiBdCE>a new tune plays</a>.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/jZV4XVM.png alt="outside passage" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We&#39;re at the Outside Passage...</p>
<p>The first enemy we encounter is a disembodied head that can split into two, and are invincible when they do so...the quick ones are always the hardest to take care of...</p>
<p>Heading east, a pair of stones form a stone giant that can swing their arms in a circle...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/6xinMca.png alt="swinging stone giant" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>They&#39;re invincible when they perform this attack, but they&#39;re easy to take care of.</p>
<p>Avoiding another floating temple head, I spot a chest, which has a Red Jewel inside!</p>
<p>A sentinel on the wall is also one of the new enemies here!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/kCYDVgO.png alt="insect sentinel" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Proceeding east after taking care of the floating head, two stone giants stop our progress!</p>
<p>Low on health, I return to the village to save.</p>
<p>The village music is now the same music I heard in both Angel and Lilly&#39;s Village.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a miracle I survived Angkor Wat so far! And without using the controller!</p>

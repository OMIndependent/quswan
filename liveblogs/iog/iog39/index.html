<p>We make our way back...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/fGx4Bor.png alt="gang returns" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>...and the rest of the gang comes!</p>
<p>It might be because of the vampires vanishing that they returned.</p>
<p>Neil asks Will if he&#39;s alright. Lance asks where Lilly is. Lilly flies out of Will&#39;s pocket, and turns back into a human.</p>
<p>Neil points out Will&#39;s character development. Character development, yay!</p>
<p>Kara doesn&#39;t think that matters at this point. She&#39;s thinking about how to escape Mu. Erik unties himself, and walks over to Will.</p>
<p>Lilly and Will explain about what Rama, the leader of Mu, and the ghosts of the citizens, told them.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/BcGooVd.png alt="it so sad" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Kara:</strong> &quot;...separated from those with whom they lived. Others remaining underwater...&quot;</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/WBmMyPM.png alt=mainland width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Lance:</strong> &quot;Good idea. Let&#39;s get out of here!!&quot;</p>
<p>The gang crosses deeper into the tunnel...and gather around a campfire...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/78zI9cd.png alt="seaside tunnel camp" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Will:</strong> &quot;Five days have passed since we entered the tunnel. The same scenery goes on and on. It&#39;s hard to keep track of time...&quot;</p>
<p>Neil decides to rest. Erik&#39;s everything is completely tired from the five days of endless walking...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/mvTxznd.png alt="500 miles" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Lance can&#39;t believe all the walking they had to do...</p>
<p>Kara tells Lance &quot;[he&#39;s] been tired ever since [they] started this trip.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Lilly:</strong> &quot;Lance&#39;s right, Kara. I think all of us feel the same way!&quot; Lilly decides to eat something. Everyone scatters from the campfire.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Erik&#39;s off in the corner, and tells Will not to look!</p>
<p>Lance wonders how long this tunnel is...</p>
<p>Neil explains more about the underground tunnel.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/fBgOfVP.png alt="people walked tunnel" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/hOpQoJx.png alt=insignificant width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We are but insignificant beings in the annals of history...</p>
<p>Lilly next...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/nTTru5I.png alt="longer we travel" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Lilly:</strong> &quot;Maybe all ancient people were that way.&quot; That&#39;s probably true.</p>
<p>Kara still wants high quality stuff like steak and a salad, and mentions her dry skin from all of the food she&#39;s been eating so far. Hee, oh Kara...</p>
<p>I have Will wander eastward, where we see a stray mushroom. </p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/qx4CsLi.png alt=mushroom width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I hope it&#39;s not poisonous.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/7kFyLTh.png alt="mushrooms only food" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/8fnwKhm.png alt="yesterday baked" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/1eAt4mv.png alt="boiled mushroom" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Will:</strong> &quot;<strong>Before that raw. Awfully tasteless... we can&#39;t ask too much. I&#39;ll do it to live. We have to eat...</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Returning to camp, Kara&#39;s not happy about eating more mushrooms for dinner.</p>
<p>Now I&#39;m thinking of making mushroom burgers from scratch. </p>
<p>&quot;<strong>In this way, another day passed slowly...</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Now we&#39;re at a pond, or a body of water...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/yBB3wIL.png alt="eighth day" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Will:</strong> &quot;Unable to sleep, I stared at an underground river.....&quot;</p>
<p>Lilly sees Will, knowing he can&#39;t sleep.</p>
<p><strong>Will:</strong> &quot;No. I&#39;m looking for more mushrooms, just kidding.&quot; Oh, Will...</p>
<p>Lilly mentions Will&#39;s character development again.</p>
<p><strong>Will:</strong> &quot;I don&#39;t understand it myself, but...I can use some strange power, and my body has changed to the body of a warrior. The change seems to have started when my father went to the Tower of Babel. I&#39;m just starting to understand that power.&quot;</p>
<p>He asks Lilly why she joined this journey.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/jEpszie.png alt="for fun" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Oh, Lilly...</p>
<p>Two weeks have passed, and everyone&#39;s still in the tunnel! Where&#39;s the end???</p>
<p>Kara mentions an &quot;odd sound&quot; coming from the tops of the tunnel. Lance points it out too, but he&#39;s too tired.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/hIQqk0S.png alt="too tired" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>That should be a reaction pic.</p>
<p>There&#39;s the sound!</p>
<p>Is that a boulder? No, there&#39;s now a whole lot of shaking going on...</p>
<p>The battle music plays again. Erik thinks it&#39;s the Riverson monster again!</p>
<p><strong>Kara:</strong> &quot;Oh no! We&#39;ve got to run!!&quot;<br>
<strong>Lilly:</strong> &quot;Run? Run where?!&quot; Yeah, where?</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The sound begins to soften a little. Neil tells everyone to be quiet. He&#39;s familiar with the sound...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/GeN3TA8.png alt="morse code" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Does this mean Samuel Morse exists in this universe?</p>
<p>Neil decodes it.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/u6RaTCY.png alt="seth speaks" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Seth&#39;s speaking to us in Morse code! Oh my god, he&#39;s alive!</p>
<p><strong>Seth:</strong> &quot;I was swallowed by Riverson...when I came to, the form of my body had that&#39;s to Riverson&#39;s. This Riverson is a creature who lives in the ocean. I don&#39;t know if its human or not.&quot;</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/HHsEOeM.png alt="comet warning" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>A comet? Could that be the one that&#39;s been prophesized?</p>
<p><strong>Seth:</strong> &quot;I wanted to continue the journey with you, but not in this body. You must figure out this riddle of the comet and the ruins...&quot;</p>
<p>That&#39;s it. </p>
<p>Kara&#39;s getting creeped out...</p>
<p><strong>Lance:</strong> &quot;This guy must have studied Morse code...Seth, too, did a good thing.&quot;<br>
<strong>Erik:</strong> &quot;But Seth didn&#39;t have a human form!!&quot;</p>
<p>Neil tells Erik not to jump to conclusions yet.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/8v7VOGo.png alt="human shape is best shape" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Rough translation typo here?</p>
<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> I&#39;m going to guess that this Riverson &quot;creature&quot; isn&#39;t a creature at all (I thought of Riverson as a leviathan in earlier sessions), but maybe a fast moving submarine?</p>

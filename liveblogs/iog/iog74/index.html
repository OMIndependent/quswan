<p>I&#39;m probably going to be posting less for this week and for the weeks afterward since I got the new <em>Zelda</em> game for Christmas and I&#39;m enjoying it a lot!</p>
<p>Let&#39;s just hope I finish this game in two weeks&#39; time!</p>
<p>I have Will transform into Shadow for the first time...</p>
<p>As we approach the statue, Shadow introduces themselves to Will.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/J0wW4Ms.png alt=waiting width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>How long have you been waiting, Shadow?</p>
<p>He doesn&#39;t answer that question.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ubzDfw8.png alt="light of the comet" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The light of a comet? Oh no, did Shadow come from the same comet that&#39;s about to fall soon?</p>
<p>Looks like this game is getting serious...</p>
<p><strong>Shadow:</strong> &quot;My body has no shape. This body appears only when the human consciousness evolves. <strong>The comet that now approaches Earth is also a consciousness without form.</strong> My body is the only thing that can confront the comet and bring it to an end.&quot;</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/mBW84x8.png alt="close your eyes" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Let&#39;s see what Shadow looks like...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ReHI3Am.png alt="shadow form" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Shadow doesn&#39;t walk or run, they float!</p>
<p>I use the Aura to dissolve Shadow under the floor before the hierolgyph room...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/zrd8NLi.png alt=melt width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Nothing&#39;s happening. Am I doing something wrong or am I at the wrong place?</p>
<p>I go back to the main hall, where I use the Aura, and Shadow finally goes underground!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/CrJLZ9M.png alt="hub room" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We save at the Dark Space gate there.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Now we can switch either to Freedan or to Will in this area.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/5iljvl1.png alt="will o freedan?" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>But I stay as Shadow and head into the west passage.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/UbqOG4N.png alt="which passage?" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Now which passage should I enter?</p>
<p>I take the leftmost west tunnel.</p>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/0XjvvTJC2gY>The music changes into a piece that would not feel too out of place in an epic set in the desert.</a></p>
<p>Shadow&#39;s weapon is their hand!</p>
<p>They easily take care of the security orb west of this room!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Shadow can&#39;t float up ramps...</p>
<p>Going downstairs, we meet up with two more security orbs, and at the foot, and an eagle guard armed with shield and spear!</p>
<p>We end up at a dead end and we take to the middle tunnel back at the hub room.</p>
<p>Security laser orbs galore in this room...</p>
<p>After encountering another dead end downstairs, I use the Aura power to dissolve Shadow through a set of bricks to enter another chamber!</p>
<p>Now for this room downstairs, three more security orbs and a bird guard lie in wait!</p>
<p>We win another defense boost and move into a tunnel west...</p>
<p>There&#39;s 19 enemies total in the next chamber!</p>
<p>We power through the security orbs and guards and float down more sets of stairs...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/oJmhrXw.png alt="more stairs" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We make it to the bottom floor, where there are two guards left here. Our prize for clearing the area is an attack boost!</p>
<p>At the end of the long chamber, we win another Red Jewel!</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Six flights of stairs, and a drop into an opening later, we make it back to the hub room to heal...</p>
<p>I notice a swirling blue pool at the end of the east wing here. Does it lead anywhere in the Pyramid?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/7isAqGe.png alt="blue portal" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>After healing, we go into the last tunnel in the west wing...</p>
<p>...filled with more orbs and guards!</p>
<p>I notice a ramp and a wide abyss...</p>
<p>Down more stairs later, we come across another dead end, but it&#39;s not empty...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/aeQSX4u.png alt="invisible enemies" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>For some reason, we get hurt by more enemies, fireball-casting and invisible!</p>
<p>They reveal themselves as floating bird heads!</p>
<p>We sink into the floor, down into another chamber with stairs in both directions!</p>
<p>West goes into a tunnel, and to the east, there&#39;s two buttons...activating one of them makes a sound but nothing visible&#39;s happening...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/F4gfrXE.png alt="two buttons" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Further east is another tunnel going up.</p>
<p>While taking care of another security orb, I realize what the buttons on the edges of the gap are for: they&#39;re for an elevator!</p>
<p>I press the button upstairs and wait for the floor to rise as we head back...</p>
<p>It seems that I&#39;ll have to bring Will here for this part.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/PIu9wo0.png alt="ramp need will" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I stop here for now.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Alright, let&#39;s see how far we can go for tonight&#39;s session...</p>
<p>I switch back to Will and use his Spin Dash on the ramp in the first room that we entered...</p>
<p>After Spin Dashing on another ramp, and leaping past a wide gap, we come across more security orbs!</p>
<p>After taking care of the last orb, we win a defense boost!</p>
<p>Down the passage we continue on...</p>
<p>Well, this is a handful...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Z5perHM.png alt="six orbs a handful" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>It seems the Spin Dash can attack enemies too...</p>
<p>We take two passes with the Spin Dash to take care of the six orbs here.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a high, steep ramp blocks our way through to the passage ahead...</p>
<p>We turn back and go to the third room in the west wing, Spin Dashing our way to another chest with a Red Jewel inside!</p>
<p>After the last enemy here has been taken care of, we win another defense boost! This is probably the game&#39;s way of compensating for all those health boosts in Angkor Wat...</p>
<p>We make a second attempt at scaling the steep ramp deep in the first room...and we make it!</p>
<p>By starting a Spin Dash on top of the smaller decline, we scale the larger ramp easily!</p>
<p>For clearing the area of security forces, another defense boost is ours!!</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>At the end, we&#39;re greeted with another stairway leading down and a small ramp.</p>
<p>On the other side of the chasm, there&#39;s another blue pool and another tunnel forward...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/qT20VOG.png alt="tunnel and blue pool" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I have Will check on the pool.</p>
<p>This pool, or portal, seems to lead us back to the hub room.</p>
<p>I decide to stay and press on for a bit. Let&#39;s hope this next tunnel doesn&#39;t have a boss, or more enemies...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/xskMoky.png alt="hieroglyph room" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Yes, I&#39;m right this time!</p>
<p>I have Will check up on the framed bird hieroglyph...</p>
<p><strong>Will:</strong> &quot;<strong>There&#39;s a lithograph on the wall. I heard in Dao that it&#39;s a hieroglyph...</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Will decides to take out the tablet from the wall! Knowing how these scenarios play out, I would&#39;ve been against the idea...</p>
<p>But as Will picks up the <strong>Hieroglyph Stone</strong>, nothing happens! That was close...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/9uPL0TO.png alt="hieroglyph get" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We use the portal, which returns us up to the surface.</p>
<p>That&#39;s it for tonight!</p>

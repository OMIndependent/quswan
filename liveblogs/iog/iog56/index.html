<p>With Kruks mounted, we set off to the northwest for the city of Euro!</p>

<p>Entering the city, the place looks as lively as the Imperial cities (Northtown and Southtown, I think?) in <em>Secret of Mana</em>...</p>

<p>The camera pans west, glossing over the sights of Euro, where many green and blue haired people walk about.</p>
<p><strong>Will:</strong> &quot;We crossed the desert and finally arrived in the village of Euro. Euro was a bustling city, larger than I had imagined.&quot;</p>
<p>There&#39;s a long row of merchants selling their wares at a long street.</p>

<p>So that means Will is well-connected indeed...</p>
<p>The camera stops at a museum-like building. This is probably Neil&#39;s parents&#39; manor.</p>

<p><strong>Will:</strong> &quot;Neil hadn&#39;t been there for three years. His parents welcomed him home. They set off fireworks. There were dancers. It looked like a festival had started [...] We were shown to the guest room.&quot;</p>
<p>Inside the house now, where background music from Edward&#39;s Castle plays. The music&#39;s nice for vast explorations.</p>

<p><strong>Neil:</strong> &quot;Well, make yourself at home. I want to talk to my parents. It&#39;s been three years.&quot;</p>
<p>Erik&#39;s worried about getting lost in the manor since he doesn&#39;t know where the bathroom is.</p>
<p>Karaâ€™s amazed at the size of the house.</p>
<p><strong>Kara:</strong> &quot;...The townspeople seem to be richer than the King...&quot;</p>
<p>This makes me wonder, how did Neil&#39;s folks attain their wealth? Exploitation of other people?</p>

<hr>
<p>We leave for the hallway of the manor.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/mbcahpW.png alt="parent house" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The place is vast but looks comfy to live in. The warmth of the house can be felt even in the hallway.</p>
<p>Where to next?</p>
<p>I decide to cheat a bit and look at a map of the city this time since I&#39;m in a rush to find a Dark Space portal and stop my session for tonight.</p>
<p>The portal&#39;s inside a small house southeast of the city.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/QeP2KZg.png alt="shrine house" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>My goodness, Neil&#39;s parents&#39; house looks like a holy chapel of sorts!</p>
<p>There&#39;s a line outside to go into a building...</p>
<p>Entering the door next to the long line, I get pushed out by a clerk saying that I entered an exit!</p>
<p>My god, what a large city!</p>
<p>I check the online map again. The portal&#39;s on the second floor of the first house I entered.</p>

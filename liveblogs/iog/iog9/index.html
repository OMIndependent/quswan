<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>I have Will transform into Freedan and continue onwards in the dungeon!</p>
<p>Now we meet the enemy that finished us off last time!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/GFfMCSd.png alt="skeleton old nemesis" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I make careful work of the skeleton, staying away from his range as best as possible.</p>
<p>Once I take care of the floating skull, the pathway forward is clear!</p>
<p>Now for the remaining enemies in this area...</p>
<p>...and I win a Defense Boost!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as Freedan, I can&#39;t play Grandma&#39;s melody, as he doesn&#39;t have a flute to play.</p>
<p>I organize the Red Jewels before proceeding back to Dark Space, to have Gaia heal us, and save at this point.</p>
<p>Into the next doorway, where I&#39;m in a castle hallway. A prompt tells us something:</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/KtN2056.png alt="goodbye freedan" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>So once all the enemies are taken care of, it&#39;s goodbye, Freedan...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/d4aUbCS.png alt="freedan kneels" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>...and Freedan kneels down, turning back into Will!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/TFn5nec.png alt="back as will" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Nothing in the barrels to pick up.</p>
<p>Ahead, we see someone...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/hTYJzJ0.png alt="who is this?" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Could this person be friend or foe?</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We walk towards the person, it&#39;s a girl!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/BBrdpaw.png alt="you change chg shape" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>So she can also change form as well, huh? She introduces herself.</p>
<p><strong>Lilly:</strong> &quot;<strong>I&#39;m Lilly. An Itory girl protected by the Flower Spirit.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>By the color of the font, this girl was the fairy, or the dandelion, we hit while moving the statue! She might&#39;ve also been the one who helped us open the door in the button puzzle!</p>
<p>But she has other questions to ask Will...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/GNY1YN5.png alt="how do you knwo abt melody?" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Will explains about his Grandma teaching him that melody.</p>
<p>Lilly mentions she had her pie. Grandma Grandma, always the experimental chef...</p>
<p>Will&#39;s in shock that Lilly knew his Grandma!</p>
<p><strong>Lilly:</strong> &quot;Actually, she asked me to rescue you!&quot; <strong>What?</strong></p>
<p>We hear a warping noise...</p>
<p>That&#39;s a call from the Elder of Itory. Lilly leaves to meet him. She greets Will goodbye.</p>
<p>Lilly turns back into a flower and flutters away...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Back at Edward&#39;s Castle again...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/2IzBbRc.png alt="back in celler" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>By the darker shade of the castle walls, it&#39;s nighttime...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/BmRrT7K.png alt="more patrols" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>More patrols, dangit!</p>
<p>There&#39;s a maid on the second floor, but she doesn&#39;t stop us. I&#39;m betting she knows there&#39;s something different with the King.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/0pPWjXo.png alt="take kara" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The romantic couple&#39;s still hanging out before the tower.</p>
<p>Looking at the scenery at the wall, it&#39;s pretty nice at night!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/GaJLXA4.png alt="nice scenery" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>But I make it to the Princess&#39;s room, where the patrolman guarding the room is sleeping...</p>
<p>The Princess is overjoyed to see us!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/D9LIDMU.png alt="of course you've come" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Kara reveals the guard&#39;s nickname. Hee...</p>
<p><strong>Kara:</strong> &quot;Was the guard asleep outside? His nickname is &#39;Old Snorehead.&#39; Sleeping again.&quot;</p>
<p>Will mentions Hamlet with Kara.</p>
<p>Kara introduces her pig to Will. She calls Hamlet &quot;cute.&quot; She also mentions another quality of Hamlet&#39;s.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/3aaWXsZ.png alt="pig power" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>&quot;Pig power&quot;?</p>
<p><strong>Kara:</strong> &quot;Please, take me out of here!&quot; Will do.</p>
<p>Together, with our new ally, we make our way downstairs.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/h1lRWdS.png alt="will and kara" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I notice that whenever I have a Red Jewel equipped and I use it, they go straight to the Jeweler Gem!</p>
<p>I do the same with the second Red Jewel.</p>
<p>So Kara has no stats...</p>
<p>As soon as we get down, I find a typo of Kara&#39;s name as Kara stops us...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/kqrudEK.png alt=karen width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>She asks us to come along to the cellar to get some food.</p>
<p>We do so, and inside an open barrel, we find more food.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ABLEn6i.png alt="large leg of yak" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I&#39;ve never tasted yak before...I wonder how large the roast yak leg is?</p>
<p>Kara tells us we should head out asap.</p>
<p>I feel like we need to bring more food...the leg of yak might not be enough.</p>
<p>We finally make it back to the front doors again...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/kfwcAcv.png alt="at last we leave" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Kara suggests going back to South Cape to visit Grandma Grandma and Grandpa Bill.</p>

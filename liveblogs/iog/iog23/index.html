<p>I visit Erik back at the inn, where the gang&#39;s almost back together again!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/mppP3Vu.png alt="good to be friends" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Poor Erik...</p>
<p><strong>Erik:</strong> &quot;My tears have all been cried...&quot;</p>
<p>Lilly thinks that Lance should stay at the inn until he remembers everything.</p>
<p>Our next stop is the diamond mine...</p>
<p>Will walks a long ways southeast of the continent, and into a peak.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/7EbHU3E.png alt="diamond mine map" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Here we are! In another dungeon we go...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ugMdaZo.png alt="diamond mine" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Before heading in, Will monologues again.</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>The Diamond Mine was as quiet as a tomb. A chill ran down Will&#39;s spine when he heard the screams from the back of the cave.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>I strike at the lizardman first! Then the lizard creature unleashes their whip!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/RI20XJj.png alt="lizard fight" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We swiftly dodge and take care of him.</p>
<p>Up ahead, a burrowing worm pops out of the ground!</p>
<p>More lizards and worms are on patrol as we continue our way in the mine!</p>
<p>As a reward for clearing the room, Will gets a health boost! Now Will&#39;s health is up to 14!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>In the next room, after taking care of a lizardman, I have Will read a sign. The sign shows an elevator entrance south of the sign.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/oIKzwT8.png alt="sign to elevator door" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The elevator is locked, though.</p>
<p>There&#39;s one laborer shackled to a chain ball in the mine here...time to free him!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/H5YrMO0.png alt="lizard and laborer" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>After taking care of the lizardman, I free the laborer! The laborer gives us more info about the mine.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/t8XKPHB.png alt="eight people to rescue" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>It turns out this is another &quot;rescue the people from the mines&quot; quest.</p>
<p>Checking the pause screen, there&#39;s 21 enemies left in this shaft.</p>
<p>Ahead, I meet a one-eyed floating creature!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/XCKcnAu.png alt=gorgon width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The creature can shoot beams from their eye, and turn into stone!</p>
<p>I continue to clear the shaft of lizardpeople and gorgons here! I also need to watch Will&#39;s health here!</p>
<p>Taking care of a nearby worm, we open up the gorgon duo&#39;s pen!</p>
<p>More monsters later, I&#39;m nearly low on health, but I&#39;m saved by a health pickup dropped by a worm!</p>
<p>I also free the laborer from his chains when trying to take care of the reptilian patroller guarding him!</p>
<p>Talking to the laborer, he gives us a secret.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/YMoichl.png alt="secret passage" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Hmmm...a secret passage...</p>
<p>He tells us that in order to find it, we need to watch for a breeze blowing through the cracks in the wall. I need to watch carefully at Will&#39;s animation. If his hair is blowing in front of a wall, then we&#39;ve found the passage.</p>
<p>Heading south, more monsters to take care of! Plus, I get an herb from a chest, yes!</p>
<p>I continue clearing out the horde of monsters in the shaft...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Up the stairs we go to a higher part of the shaft, where I activate a button nearby. Down south, another button!</p>
<p>The worms guarding it nearly take down Will&#39;s health...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/8PPT1KW.png alt="another button" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>West, a lizardman&#39;s watching over the last button.</p>
<p>I take care of him, gaining another boost!</p>
<p>Up north, I activate the last button, and open the trapdoor leading deeper into the mine.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/0RSFpdU.png alt="trapdoor open" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Six enemies here in this shaft...</p>
<p>I circle this shaft and descend.</p>
<p>After finishing off the enemies here, I gain access to another Dark Space portal!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/rBj5nSs.png alt="dark space portal" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Looks like it&#39;s still Freedan here.</p>
<p>I recover and save before turning into Freedan and heading out again.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>In the next shaft, I notice a long rope above us.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/L1fs0kn.png alt="long rope" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>That must be the mine&#39;s delivery system.</p>
<p>Ahead, we come across two ramps...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/nLIDyt6.png alt="two ramps" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I have Freedan climb the stairs and run down to get to the ledge across.</p>
<p>I descend again and take care of more creatures here...</p>
<p>There&#39;s only one enemy left, but they&#39;re unreachable for now.</p>
<p>In the next room, more gorgons!</p>
<p>One opens the passage forward.</p>
<p>This passage is cramped with tons of fencing and enemies!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/JFKVA1J.png alt="cramped fences" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Ahead, another Dark Space portal awaits us! This feels a bit too easy here...</p>
<p>I recover and change back to Will...</p>
<p>The second laborer we freed earlier mentioned a secret room in the mine. Since Will&#39;s hair is blowing here, this means...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/GshRVov.png alt="secret wall" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>After a dash, we open the room!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/TWUVZKh.png alt="room open" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Ahead, there&#39;s another Dark Space portal. My goodness, this game&#39;s getting generous with us!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/wPPMoxm.png alt="another dark space" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>At Freedan&#39;s statue, something is glowing in front of him...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/WR59nHx.png alt="statue glowing" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Looks like Freedan has a new power: <strong>Dark Friar!</strong></p>
<p>Gaia explains what <strong>Dark Friar</strong> is, and how Freedan can use the power.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/s45wxP7.png alt="dark friar" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We talk to Gaia again, who mentions that the <strong>Dark Friar</strong> is a long range attack.</p>
<p>I demo the new power, where Freedan&#39;s aura glows red. Once I let go, a fireball comes out!</p>
<p>Going back to the unreachable enemy, it takes me a few tries to charge the power!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/7nvhJ7y.png alt="facing unreachable enemy" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Defeating the enemy breaks the fence blocking the ramp!</p>
<p>I have Freedan start on a dash down the ramp...</p>
<p>We make it!</p>
<p>Inside the upper room, we free a third laborer, who tells us more laborers were forced to work in the deeper parts of the mine. He gives us a key that opens the elevator!</p>
<p>I go back to Gaia and save at this point.</p>
<p>I wonder if we&#39;re going to find Seth here?</p>

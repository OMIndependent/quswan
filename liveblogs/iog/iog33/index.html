<p>After unlocking the door to the tunnel, Lilly speaks to us.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/PvRwQOn.png alt="phantom land" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I&#39;m thinking by the way she used the word &quot;phantom&quot; to describe Mu, she&#39;s probably warning us...</p>
<p>We go inside, where the interior of the tunnel&#39;s different. For some reason, the color of the flooring reminds me of the Endless Staircase anteroom in <em>Super Mario 64</em>...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/xgEYZv7.png alt="long corridor" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>It&#39;s a pretty long walk...</p>
<p>In the middle of the passage Lilly gives us more warnings...or not, as she&#39;s wondering whether this directly leads to Mu.</p>
<p>After a short walk, there&#39;s an entrance...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/zJaYcSK.png alt=mu width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We&#39;re at <strong>Mu!</strong></p>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/GGSoIFxzAO4>Here&#39;s the music for the land of Mu.</a></p>
<p><strong>Will:</strong> &quot;Lilly and I set foot on Mu. They will probably welcome us after waking from a sleep of thousands of years...&quot;</p>
<p>It seems 19 other enemies are wanting to welcome us too.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>A new enemy, a <strong>rock colossus</strong>, or an iron giant, awakens!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/WI7TvRV.png alt="rock giant" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>His greeting is to throw rocks at us!</p>
<p>This rock giant has lots of health!</p>
<p>Before his health is gone, he retreats into his resting self! After waking up, I take care of the giant.</p>
<p>I cross to the lower parts of the land. The passage down the slope, however, is flooded!</p>
<p>We need to find a way to drain the water...</p>
<p>Going through the long south passage now...</p>
<p>After taking care of another rock giant, the passage eastwards opens!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/5uwFOwC.png alt="blue slimes ahoy" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>There&#39;s plenty of blue slimes around Mu.</p>
<p>Up ahead, two rock giants bar our way. With careful dodging, we take care of them!</p>
<p>From the map, there&#39;s six enemies left in this area. I&#39;m guessing after we drain the water here, we can probably clear the place!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/TlseEyG.png alt="to next area" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>In the east, there&#39;s 26 enemies in this area!</p>
<p>As I walk forward, a <strong>phantom</strong> suddenly appears! They&#39;re getting ready to cast their magic.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/9Kz2knv.png alt="phantom magic" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>And their magic hits Will square in the face!</p>
<p>It becomes a game of chase with the phantom...</p>
<p>...but I manage to take care of him!</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/W45myJ3.png alt="rock giant guarding chest" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Southeast, there&#39;s a rock giant guarding a chest...</p>
<p>The giant&#39;s only invincible when he wakes up, but when angered, the giant spreads rocks in his line-of-sight!</p>
<p>Plus, this giant&#39;s faster at throwing rocks compared to his other cousins in the previous area now.</p>
<p>But it was all for nothing, as we get nothing in the chest!</p>
<p>Up northeast, there&#39;s a pulsing ring of blue near some blue slimes...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/GucHKE3.png alt="blue slimes ahoy" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>And another phantom comes in!</p>
<p>Like the last one we faced, it takes patience to take care of him...</p>
<p>Touching the pulsing ring, it pushes Will super-fast! But I can move it by hitting the ring with the flute! If I have Will perform his dash on it...</p>
<p>Nothing happens, except Will gets pushed back!</p>
<p>I also learn that while twirling the flute, the rings can be drawn to Will!</p>
<p>South, more rock giants! And another pulsing ring!</p>
<p>Farther southwards, the gray drops make their return as I cross a maze of rocks...</p>
<p>But Will gets KO&#39;d and kicked back to the start of the area after getting hit by more rock giants&#39; projectiles!</p>
<p>I decide to move the blue rings to the flooded area...no good either.</p>
<p>Back to taking care of the remaining enemies...</p>
<p>Will&#39;s almost low on health again.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/TK1UOBC.png alt=spikes width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Yikes! Spikes!</p>
<p>Knowing we&#39;re spent, I have Will dash back to the Seaside Palace and save once more.</p>
<p>What do those rings do? Or rather, what are they for?</p>

<p>Crossing the platforms, we face the next boss!</p>
<p>Each piece of the bridge begins to crumble as we continue forward...</p>
<p>We make it to the platform, where our next boss is a statue head with wings!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/aK5fGcF.png alt="second boss" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I also have to be careful of the falling debris!</p>
<p>The statue head shoots out crystals from their mouth!</p>
<p>I manage to get a few hits on the boss!</p>
<p>I suddenly notice Freedan&#39;s health is almost low. </p>
<p>Knowing I&#39;m finished, I do my best to survive this boss...</p>
<p>This boss also has a few surprises! They can shoot feathers like arrows!</p>
<p>And the boss finishes us off quickly!</p>
<p>I recover at Dark Space before take two at the flying statue head!</p>
<p>Since this is a flying boss, they can also blow gusty drafts at us with their wings!</p>
<p>The debris, I find out quickly, isn&#39;t hurting us at all! It&#39;s only the boss!</p>
<p>I use up a herb, and a brief moment later, with careful dodging and timing, I watch the mini-fireworks display!</p>

<p>A <strong>Mystic Statue</strong>!?</p>
<p>The menu shows us the Mystic Statues we currently have so far...there&#39;s four left to obtain.</p>

<p>Freedan transforms back into Will...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/sdzWodM.png alt="neil calls to will" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Neil:</strong> &quot;Will! You&#39;re falling to the ground!!!! Grab the airplane, and we&#39;ll fly out of here!&quot;</p>
<p>I have Will jump down the falling platform...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/qAKDVV7.png alt="will jumps down" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>...and into the body of Neil&#39;s airplane!</p>
<p>But, Will misses the landing!</p>
<p>Will&#39;s going to fall!</p>
<p>Kara chastises him for missing Will. Lance encourages Neil to try again!</p>
<p>Neil descends...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/hoa6GDL.png alt="neil tries again" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>...and Will makes it!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/OkHc7H5.png alt="that was close" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>No kidding...</p>
<p>Kara and Erik are weeping at the close call...Lance tells them to calm down. Lance, let them cry...</p>
<p>Lilly compliments Neil and his airplane for saving Will.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Now we have to find ruin number three. Maybe the next ruin is in Sam&#39;s country.</p>
<p>Neil gives us a hint on where the next ruin is.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/3FZvwUx.png alt=mu width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Neil flies to the ocean, mentioning the temple of Mu around there.</p>
<p>The Mode 7 graphics in this game look so excellent...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/97YuMGu.png alt="ocean mode 7" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I wish we could control the airplane...</p>
<p>We hear a &quot;Bam bam bam!&quot;</p>
<p>Did the airplane explode, or did something shoot at it?</p>
<p>Everyone&#39;s parachuting down to the ocean...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ognYxd8.png alt=parachute width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Neil&#39;s a good inventor, but it seems there&#39;s always something missing in his inventions...I guess nobody&#39;s perfect, including Neil.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Will wakes up in a room in front of a fancy locked door...</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>The next thing he knew, Will was standing in a huge palace.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Will:</strong> &quot;I couldn&#39;t remember anything since the water landing...Is everyone safe?&quot;</p>
<p>Yeah, is everyone alright? And where are we?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/66NEjAW.png alt="fancy door" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Going east, we see a skeleton!</p>
<p>By the looks of the temple outside, and the waves above, we must be underwater!</p>
<p>Checking the map, I see a blue dot. We&#39;re near a Dark Space portal yes!</p>
<p>Striking at the skeleton, he freezes!</p>
<p>Inside the portal, I save and stop my session for today.</p>

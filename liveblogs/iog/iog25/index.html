<p>I find the nearest Dark Space portal and transform back into Will.</p>
<p>After long backtracking, we head back into Freejia.</p>
<p>Imas, Remus, and Sam are gone now...</p>
<p>Back at the inn, I have Will use the Memory Melody from Sam to help Lance...</p>

<p>This game does have an <em>Ocarina of Time</em> feel to it...and this was released five years before that game.</p>
<p>Now we&#39;re inside a Dark Space of sorts, as the stars begin to rise up...<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wneh3m88xkM">the calm music</a> begins playing again.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/H4xHoKY.png alt="what is this?" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Kara:</strong> &quot;Somehow I feel a little homesick...&quot;<br>
<strong>Erik:</strong> &quot;I feel like I&#39;m back in the womb...&quot;<br>
<strong>Lilly:</strong> &quot;Everything that&#39;s happened and the people I&#39;ve met are pouring into my head...&quot;</p>
<p>Lance recites his origins...</p>
<p><strong>Lance:</strong> &quot;When my father didn&#39;t come back from an expedition...the most important thing in my life was gone. I didn&#39;t know what to do.&quot; So his story is the same as Will&#39;s...</p>
<p>Kara mentions her reason for going on this quest with us: her hatred of her father because of his obsession of conquering other lands.</p>
<p><strong>Kara:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s awful when someone loses their life. What had taken years to put together was destroyed in one moment.&quot;</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/bABvFQK.png alt="is seth alright" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I&#39;m wondering that too, Erik. Where is Seth?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/QwpPKCK.png alt="people live on" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The Dark Space is gone, and Lance looks around the room. He wonders what he&#39;s doing, and where everyone is now.</p>
<p>Lilly points out Lance has regained his memory!</p>
<p>Talking to Erik again, he mentions someone again.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/0rjFHAZ.png alt=inventor width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> (ciphered for <em>Soul Blazer</em> spoilers) V jbaqre, vf guvf vairagbe gur qrfpraqnag bs Qe. Yrb?</p>
<p><strong>Erik:</strong> &quot;I think his name is Neil...&quot;</p>
<p>Will internally pulls the elevator stop button after he hears that name.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/XsptnTq.png alt="did you say neil" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Will:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s the same name as my lost cousin!!&quot; How many family members does Will have?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/IBTvMqJ.png alt=airplanes width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>There&#39;s airplanes in the Age of Exploration!? Unless that airplane is similar to da Vinci&#39;s helicopter concept...</p>
<p>I reset the game since I forgot to talk to Kara and Lilly.</p>
<p>As I replay through the mine, I notice that the first mine key could be found as a sparkle on the ground in the morgue...</p>
<p>I notice as I returned to Freejia on the map, Freedan changes back to Will!</p>
<p>I listen through the memories and motivations of Will&#39;s friends once again...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/6tafQFb.png alt="will you're crying" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Will&#39;s not crying, you&#39;re crying...</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>So Will and his group went to the inventor&#39;s house.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>It looks like a fellowship&#39;s making their journey here.</p>

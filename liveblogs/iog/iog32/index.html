<p>Back to the deeper parts of the palace, the monsters have resurrected!</p>
<p>Going to the eastern stairway, I&#39;m in a room in front of three coffins...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/l0fCcny.png alt=coffins width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I examine each one from left to right.</p>
<p>On the leftmost coffin, Lilly asks if there&#39;s a hole in this one, and flies to examine the coffin herself. She goes in, and opens it!</p>
<p>She found something in there!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/p7KPC9X.png alt="strange stone" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>It&#39;s the <strong>Purification Stone!</strong></p>
<p>I examine the second coffin, letting Lilly have a look.</p>
<p><strong>Lilly:</strong> &quot;Strange...there&#39;s a key fastened inside this coffin. No wonder it didn&#39;t open.&quot;</p>
<p>The third coffin&#39;s empty. It must be for the vampire that got out...</p>
<p>Heading down and to the western passage, a gray slime drops down from the ceiling! There&#39;s a lot of slimes in this palace!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/5Bxw7Ie.png alt="gray slime" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I have Will go to the end of the corridor, where two more gray slimes drop!</p>
<p>up the stairway we go...</p>
<p>...where we get another Red Jewel inside!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I go down the middle stairway and head west...</p>
<p>...to a room where both Lance and Neil are! Or rather, their ghosts!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/SeFMsam.png alt="lance & neil ghost" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Lance is groaning like a zombie...so&#39;s Neil.</p>
<p>And the monsters have regenerated!</p>
<p>Back outside, I come across one blue slime and a gray slime parade!</p>
<p>In the far right stairway, we&#39;re now in a room covered with vines with a pool of that looks like a gray void in the center!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/GYxF9uR.png alt=fountain width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Lilly:</strong> &quot;Could there be a connection between this and the rock...?&quot;</p>
<p>I decide to take care of the enemies here first before thinking about using the Stone of Purification in this pool...</p>
<p>I manage to take care of every enemy but five invisible ones above before going back to the fountain.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/IFiUPeB.png alt="massive fountain" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Nothing happening here, so I have Will move to the north end of the fountain.</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>The stone began to glow, then disappeared into the spring.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/AAFs3GI.png alt="stone rises" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I don&#39;t know if this is a good sign or not...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Flashes of light...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/QU6pRvo.png alt="fountain pure" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The water in the fountain&#39;s turned pure again...</p>
<p>Back upstairs, the map isn&#39;t showing up anymore when I pause! More proof that everything&#39;s okay is that there&#39;s people now!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/CV3Zmql.png alt="demon changed" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Lilly:</strong> &quot;What!? All the demons we saw before were human beings...?&quot;</p>
<p>So the skeletons in the upper chambers of the palace were people? Oh my god!</p>
<p>A blue haired woman feels relieved to be freed from being a demon, saying that &quot;death is terrifying!&quot;</p>
<p>I go west to see if Lance and Neil are alive...</p>
<p>They&#39;re gone...</p>
<p>Upstairs, there&#39;s a trader who was going to be carted off to prison for trafficking people, but was given away to the vampire instead!</p>
<p>Another man implies the vampire might be a woman...the blue-haired woman next to him says the vampire was a &quot;nice guy!&quot; It&#39;s the last time she&#39;ll trust men.</p>
<p>One trader upstairs in the coffin room thinks that vampire slept in one of the coffins...</p>
<p>A man says there are <strong>two</strong> vampires who live in the palace!</p>
<p>He explains their process of luring people into the palace. They turn their victims into demons, and use them for labor! Eeee....</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Another woman gives us more info about the vampiric duo.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/QCXTHhl.png alt="vampires looking" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Are they trying to look for the third Mystic Statue, or do they have the statue?</p>
<p>I wonder, did the vampires take Lance, Neil, Erik, and Kara?</p>
<p>From another woman, we learn that they don&#39;t have the statue yet.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/57kY69y.png alt="mystic statue in mu" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>That brings up the question: <strong>Why do the vampires need the statue for?</strong></p>
<p>At the dead end room, we see a man at the corner, who stole the key from one of the vampires!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/9TsJtDV.png alt="key get" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Yes!!!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/DSbwTie.png alt="passage to mu top floor" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>So that means the locked door where Will first woke up leads to the mainland.</p>
<p>A couple in one of the floors of the palace wonders what they&#39;ll do now since they&#39;re stuck in the underwater palace. The woman thinks of taking over the palace as their home.</p>
<p>Erik&#39;s gone...</p>
<p>At the floor where the Dark Space portal is, Kara&#39;s also missing...</p>
<p>I save before opening the door to <strong>Mu Tunnel</strong>.</p>

<p>In the house on the left of the Jeweler...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/tG05x7C.png alt="three guys" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Are these guys familiar?</p>
<p>One of them, Max, after getting lost in Mt. Kress, wonders where they&#39;re going next.</p>
<p>The other blue haired guy, Rudy, is in awe of the ruins.</p>
<p>Their boss, the man in the middle, is an explorer named Friezer. He seems to be pretty ambitious.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/XRMInbx.png alt="tower of babel look" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Good luck.</p>
<p>Next street onwards, covered by an alleyway, I have Will climb a ladder into the eastern entrance of the Rolek manor.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/MHFMTI9.png alt=shrine width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Nintendo probably changed this line from a church, I&#39;m guessing.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/YGIDR4W.png alt="inside shrine" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Referencing the map online, I press A in front of the Mother Mary statue.</p>
<p>Will notices a breeze before I notice a shape of a doorway behind the statue soon after.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/IdCcBcL.png alt="wind blowing" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Curious, we look at what&#39;s behind the statue.</p>
<p>Downstairs...</p>

<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/fItnk11.png alt=laborers width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Holy heck!</p>
<p>One laborer mentions a skeleton that used to be his friend. He was ordered to carry his friend&#39;s body to the end of the hall!</p>
<p>Another laborer &quot;misses wanting to speak [his] own language&quot; and is forced to fight...</p>
<p>A third laborer mentions the stone-turning disease again that&#39;s spreading from Asia. He&#39;s made up his mind to run away...</p>
<p>Some of the people here know a bit of Will&#39;s language.</p>
<p>At the southeastern barrel of the room, we find another Red Jewel!</p>
<p>Good luck to them! I hope they find their freedom soon...</p>
<p>I climb back down and enter another house. Its entrance is not visible in-game, as it&#39;s blocked by the roof of the house in front of it.</p>
<p>As a reward for finding the house, the man rewards us. </p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/0Vzjp1U.png alt="secret house" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>But with what? I have Will go over to the barrel. Nothing. He tells us to go.</p>
<p>From reading the guide, it turns out we get a Strength Boost!</p>
<p>We head back to the Jeweler, knowing we have 20 Red Jewels so far.</p>
<p>Will&#39;s abilities get a power boost as a reward.</p>
<p>I check the Jeweler Gem&#39;s list again.</p>
<p>If we get 30 Red Jewels, Freedan&#39;s powers get a powerup!</p>

<p>I go over to merchant&#39;s row to look at the wares. One of them is selling a teapot of women&#39;s tears, another is selling a book Rofsky wrote.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, someone&#39;s also catching up to us...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/sj0DbsL.png alt=jackal width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>A blue-haired woman asks if we believe in fortune tellers. I say yes. She repeats the same prophecy we heard back in Lilly&#39;s village, mentioning the descending comet, and Earth&#39;s impending doom.</p>
<p>Corn meal, drinks, and fish, along with fruits are being sold.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/TXLpTYp.png alt="apple juggle" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>That&#39;s a nice animation.</p>
<p>One woman offers an apple to Will for free!</p>
<p>A man in front of the green fruit stand still likes the Roleks and their company, despite their...questionable actions. *shudders*</p>
<p>I have Will fall in the long line east of merchant&#39;s row, leading into a building.</p>
<p>The woman in front of Will&#39;s curious about the line too.</p>
<p>A man two spaces after her points out why they&#39;re lining up.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Z1vrC0x.png alt="life medicine" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>A <strong>Life Medicine</strong>?</p>
<p>I go back and wait in line...</p>
<p>The line moves...</p>
<p>Slowly...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/MOF5Hlx.png alt="line moving slowly" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I wonder who thought of adding in this feature in the game?</p>
<p>Let&#39;s hope the waiting was worth it...</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>As we enter the shop, one of the clerks asks us something.</p>
<p><strong>Clerk:</strong> &quot;Aren&#39;t you Neil, from this village? Rolek manages this store too.&quot;</p>
<p>She tells us to get whatever we need without paying. Yes!</p>
<p>She follows Will around...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/b3vgYXB.png alt="two potions" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>There&#39;s two potions in front here. But which one is the Life Medicine?</p>
<p>I have Will drink the left potion. It&#39;s the <strong>Life Medicine!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Will:</strong> &quot;That taste makes my mouth pucker.&quot;</p>
<p>And we get a health boost!</p>
<p>The potion on the right is <strong>Dark Medicine</strong>. I have Will drink that one too.</p>
<p>The potion smells and tastes foul!</p>
<p>However, Freedan gets a boost in his powers!</p>
<p>In a house on the west side of merchant&#39;s row, a blue haired woman points out hearing &quot;groans&quot; coming from the &quot;luggage&quot; that the Rolek company delivers.</p>
<p>We head next door, on the far left, where the Rolek office is.</p>
<p>Upstairs, two men are talking...</p>
<p>One of the men wants in on the business, saying he &quot;can get anything [he wants]&quot; by working for them.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/hxc8Gck.png alt=anything width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Even unpaid help?</p>
<p>The employee confirms it, but he&#39;s &quot;not allowed&quot; to mention that. Oh my god...</p>
<p>We go talk to them. The employee shoos Will away because he&#39;s a kid. <strong><em>Ageist!</em></strong> <em>hiss</em></p>
<p><a name=6></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Now for the last house, Rofsky and Erasquez...</p>
<p>They&#39;re arguing about &quot;true genius.&quot;</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/EjxILrI.png alt="true genius" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Erasquez implicitly calls Rofsky a liar.</p>
<p>Rofsky is arguing about a teapot from Mt. Kress.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/tna6D5V.png alt=teapot width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Erasquez senses a &quot;strange power&quot; from Will.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/vZgmCyu.png alt="can sense what can't be seen" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Is Erasquez the proto-Natsume? Or a proto-exorcist?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/NfKGEC2.png alt="look at teapot" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Now we have a new location to explore: <strong>Mt. Kress!</strong></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/h4i4yAK.png alt="spirits tears" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>After that, we head back to the Dark Space portal and save! Whew, though it was short and covered only the city, tonight&#39;s session was still an adventure!</p>

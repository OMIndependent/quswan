<p>We follow the trade route northwest to the desert village Dao, which Will labels as such.</p>
<p>We&#39;re now inside a house, or an inn.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/QCUwJpC.png alt="town shining" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Kara says that the village doesn&#39;t look like a place famous for labor trading...</p>
<p>Erik&#39;s not leaving the house because of the sandstorm.</p>
<p>Taking a look outside, it&#39;s pretty windy...</p>
<p>A snake charmer outside the house asks Will if he&#39;s Will. I say no first since I have to check out the village.</p>
<p>The Dark Space gate is west of the snake charmer in an alleyway. That&#39;s very convenient.</p>
<p>One of the villagers mentions that &quot;children (Will, Kara, and Erik) don&#39;t come to places like [Dao] very often.&quot;</p>
<p>One of the native villagers is in a cell, following Will, while the man with the cane is tapping his foot. I&#39;m thinking the man&#39;s not a happy person.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/uCjE96S.png alt="caneman and child" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The man with the cane tells us to shoo.</p>
<p>Will tries to talk to the boy, but the language barrier between the boy and Will is high.</p>
<p>Inside the house, a man there refuses to take Will&#39;s money to free the villager, citing something decent and turning it on its head.</p>

<hr>
<p>We meet the Jeweler Gem again, and check how much Red Jewels we have so far: <strong>29</strong>.</p>
<p>Inside the house next to ours, we meet an old friend...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/4hgDT11.png alt="yay neil" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Will asks if he&#39;s doing his duties as Rolek&#39;s president. He is. Neil&#39;s trying to stop the labor trade with pepper spices.</p>
<p>Neil gives us more advice on where to find the next Mystic Statue.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Y4SImcE.png alt="pyramid next statue" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>A pyramid? Hmmmm....</p>
<p>Nice to see you again, Neil.</p>
<p>Outside, I notice a blue haired woman behind the white wall in the corner.</p>
<p>There&#39;s another Kruk!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/IdYWg8P.png alt=kruk width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The Kruk&#39;s hopping alongside a carpet merchant!</p>
<p>Talking to a merchant near the fountain, we get a brief history of where Edward Castle got its carpets.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/4xm31p6.png alt=carpets width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>40</strong> years!?</p>
<p>Another merchant tells us about a &quot;freedom movement&quot; started up by Neil.</p>
<p>I go to the blue haired girl, who gives us a &quot;sheet of paper,&quot; or a photo of someone...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/cqFjFgE.png alt=jackal! width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Oh no, he&#39;s here too? Will&#39;s also concerned.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ac5iYWC.png alt="will tense" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The dialogue cursor sound that plays whenever a letter crosses the screen, I notice, is completely absent. Little touches like that from the game devs are pretty good at heightening the tension.</p>

<hr>
<p>There&#39;s a snake charmer in the corner with 5 blue snakes in each basket.</p>
<p>He asks us if we&#39;ve ever heard of a minigame concerning snakes.</p>
<p>A man with a cane across the street from the house with the cell holding the villager tells us about a pyramid and the treasures there.</p>
<p>Inside the house near him are explorers wanting to get some loot from the pyramid. Another&#39;s surprised the pyramid hasn&#39;t sunk into the sand.</p>
<p>The third man in the middle gives us more info about the pyramid.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/MftldGG.png alt="not for the living" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Explorer:</strong> &quot;These are the words...The pyramid is a big tomb. The living can&#39;t go in? Hmmm...&quot; Wait, does that mean someone has to be taken care of before entering the pyramid?</p>
<p>Inside another house, the music changes. This is where they make the carpets...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/KuP4rSq.png alt="carpet house" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The women are too busy (and probably frightened?), and don&#39;t say anything.</p>
<p>I head into the house next to Neil&#39;s and play some games with actual snakes.</p>
<p>It&#39;s basically a whack-a-mole game.</p>
<p>Our initial score is 42.</p>
<p>I&#39;m guessing we win a Red Jewel if we get fifty.</p>
<p>I save again and stop my session here since I&#39;m running out of power on my phone.</p>

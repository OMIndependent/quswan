<p>The enemies are back again!</p>
<p>Lucky I&#39;m now at full health as I clear the area once more!</p>
<p>The second area&#39;s still pretty tough to get through, though, not least because of the floating golden skull heads.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/D5imGpg.png alt="cross formation" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Now that&#39;s an unusual sight...</p>
<p>I face off against the floating flute flame summoners again, taking care of both of them.</p>
<p>And now I&#39;m stuck!</p>
<p>I wander around the maze of plant stalks a little bit. I attempt to perform a spin dash near a raised vine next, but I&#39;m trying to remember how to do one...</p>
<p>Looking back on my comments on how to perform the Spin Dash, I have Will start.</p>
<p>It takes me one or two tries, but I make it!</p>
<p>While trying to take a screenshot of my progress, I accidentally shut down the game again!!!</p>
<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> I pushed Select and Start instead of Select and the triangle button to bring up the menu to take pics!</p>
<p>Here we go again...</p>
<p>I finally make it this time!</p>

<p>It looks like our old friend, the dark knight, has come to help us!</p>
<p>I record our progress here and take a break before continuing on...</p>

<hr>
<p>Here we go! I don the role of Freedan this time.</p>
<p>I take care of the flutist and the &quot;cross&quot; formation of enemies ahead, winning a defense boost!</p>
<p>Next area, there&#39;s a chest with 14 more enemies...</p>
<p>Using the east stalk, I leap forward and land in the middle of a nest of spiders and skull heads!</p>
<p>I make my way around the area, looking for enemies.</p>
<p>Holy heck, Freedan&#39;s Dark Friar power looks different this time! The fireballs spiral away instead of shooting forward.</p>
<p>I try to repeat that effect on other enemies, but no good.</p>
<p>As a reward for clearing the area, Freedan&#39;s health has now gone up to 29!</p>
<p>The chest in this area&#39;s hard to reach...</p>
<p>I go east, and turn back.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Orq1nqK.png alt="east path" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Taking the west path past the red caps...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ylYhuke.png alt="26 enemies!?" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Oh my god...this game is not messing around this time...</p>
<p>Let&#39;s hope this game does <strong>not</strong> have 99 enemies in the later dungeons.</p>
<p>Taking the middle path west leads to another path blocked by a giant mushroom.</p>

<hr>
<p>The giant mushrooms here make this plant maze a bit of a walk, but not frustrating, since Freedan&#39;s power makes up for it.</p>
<p>I perform the powerful version of the Dark Friar again! It turns out I needed to keep charging for a certain period of time...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/HNz5lrt.png alt="dark friar power" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>There&#39;s a lot of floating skull heads in this area...</p>
<p>I end up spamming the poweful version of the Dark Friar in front of a line of skull heads!</p>
<p>My reward is another health boost! I&#39;m now at 30!</p>
<p>Now let&#39;s see what&#39;s in this chest...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/lzHClxw.png alt="mushroom drops get" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Mushroom Drops</strong>? Hmmm...</p>
<p>I try using this on the nearby giant mushrooms, but nothing&#39;s happening.</p>
<p>Reading the drops&#39; use from the menu, it seems they only work on empty stalks, like this one in the screenshot below.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/nc054D0.png alt="empty stalks" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The stalks grow into a bridge for us to cross!</p>
<p>I save my session for tonight since I&#39;m running out of power to type here...</p>

<p>Crossing the plant stalk bridge up to the north passage, where more enemies are on the prowl!</p>
<p>My DP is almost reaching its maximum. I wonder what will happen if we have 999...</p>
<p>I end up clearing half the enemies in this area before going southeast, since there&#39;s no way to move forward here.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/GZbI3vE.png alt="no way fwd" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The next area is a den filled with numerous red caps, and fire-summoning flute players...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/j6PgDiN.png alt="red cap land" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Before crossing, I take care of a row of golden floating skulls with Freedan&#39;s superpowered Dark Friar.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a chest and an enemy on the northwest side of this area, but they&#39;re unreachable for now.</p>
<p>After stepping over a few red caps, I finally make it to that area, and get more Mushroom Drops!</p>
<p>I clean up the area, which has a fire summoner and a trio of spiders remaining.</p>
<p>Looks like our health goes up again!</p>
<p>I go back to the plant stalk in the previous area and use the drops!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/F2xEaEP.png alt="mushroom drops use" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>There&#39;s still some unreachable parts in this area. I have Freedan take to the east passage after recovering at Dark Space.</p>
<p>We now have 999 DP!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Fu3eBUH.png alt="999 dp yay" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>After reaching another mushroom roadblock, going south, there&#39;s more golden floating skull heads!</p>
<p>It takes a few tries, but we manage to aim the Dark Friar true.</p>
<p>After taking care of the last of the spiders near another Dark Space portal, we win a strength boost!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I save again and transform back into Will.</p>
<p>Whoo, I&#39;m bouncing!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/W4B4a78.png alt=bouncing width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Wait a minute...if I were sprinting, I could reach that chest in the area west of here.</p>
<p>I end up trying a number of ways to get to that stray chest. Transforming back into Freedan didn&#39;t work. Maybe if I used a Spin Dash...</p>
<p>That didn&#39;t work either.</p>
<p>At the risk of spoilers, I read an unmarked map of the Mountain Temple. It seems there is a way to reach that chest.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/9NYLTZs.png alt="long walk" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>That&#39;s a lot of sprinting I have Will do!</p>
<p>But we find it!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/hDcH4aS.png alt="we find treasure" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Another Red Jewel is ours! So that&#39;s about 23 we&#39;ve got so far...</p>
<p>We take the quick, bouncy way back, and transform back into Freedan.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t realize how huge this dungeon is until now...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Further northward, we make it into an area infested with 39 enemies!!!</p>
<p>Thank goodness I brought Freedan instead of Will, his attacks wouldn&#39;t have reached those floating skulls...</p>
<p>I manage to cut the number of enemies down to 24 and use another stalk ramp to make it to another Dark Space portal!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/kaGIPTS.png alt="another dark space" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Let&#39;s see what&#39;s different this time...</p>
<p>It looks like Freedan&#39;s getting a new power!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/qTGeBAL.png alt="aura barrier yes" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Gaia:</strong> &quot;Use the power of the Aura to put the barrier around you. Use the Attack and LR buttons for power.&quot;</p>
<p>Approaching Gaia, she gives us more advice on how to use the barrier, some obvious.</p>
<p><strong>Gaia:</strong> &quot;Freedan&#39;s power is the <strong>Aura Barrier</strong>. It puts a layer of Aura around his body. Enemies at the mountain temple are strong. If you use this power, your battles will be easier.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh dear...</p>
<p>Outside, I test Freedan&#39;s new power.</p>
<p>Raising his flaming, flashing blue sword, Freedan summons two swirling monoliths around him!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/25Sb5xS.png alt=monoliths width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>But, the barrier has a short life...</p>
<p>The barrier takes care of the enemies near Freedan easily.</p>
<p>But where&#39;s our next stop?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/gapr4JN.png alt="should we go here?" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I have Freedan go east, using the barrier to take care of some of the unreachable enemies.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>It&#39;s a battle of the swirling projectiles, with the fire-summoning flute player losing!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/rJE8bWS.png alt="battle of barriers" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Enemies clustered on the map look a bit intimidating to face...</p>
<p>After taking care of them, I have Freedan bounce on the mushrooms this time...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/hMUlG42.png alt="freedan bounce" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>...ending up in front of another chest full of Mushroom Drops!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/zZSlkKl.png alt="to the west" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>There&#39;s only one way to go from here: to the west...</p>
<p>I take care of the last of the enemies here with our new Dark power, winning another defense boost!</p>
<p>After saving and recovering, I use the drops on the stalks, and continue on once again.</p>
<p>Clearing this area, I win another defense boost!</p>
<p>This next area might lead us to more enemies, or to a boss...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/gCivg6f.png alt="a boss?" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I go all the way back to the dungeon&#39;s first Dark Space portal to save before entering.</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Eight monsters in the next area, not bad!</p>
<p>But most of them are fire summoners or floating golden skulls.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/0W8KBHR.png alt="nice view" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>This looks like a nice view...</p>
<p>After the last fire summoner is gone, we win another strength boost!</p>
<p>This area up ahead may probably be the temple proper.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/8MrjORN.png alt="is it a boss?" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>There&#39;s one chest in this area...</p>
<p>I slowly make our way up the long aisle of red caps, wary of a boss fight...</p>
<p>...but there isn&#39;t, and we leave with the treasure!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/uwg8hlF.png alt="you found teapot" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I wonder how Rofsky and Erasquez will react once they see this...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/LRG0LsO.png alt=teapot width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Now for the long way back to Euro...</p>
<p>Tbh, that temple didn&#39;t look like a temple, or maybe it was etched into the mountainside?</p>

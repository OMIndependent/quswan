<p>Okay, it seems the map and my save file spoiled me for our current location: we&#39;re at the <strong>Seaside Palace</strong>, near the continent of Mu!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/jW9x5sK.png alt="seaside palace" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Let&#39;s see what&#39;s here...</p>
<p>As soon as we venture east, Will notices something!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/2xi1fkh.png alt="kara near chest" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Near a chest, we see an apparition of Kara! What&#39;s going on here? Is she...or is Will...</p>
<p>I check the contents of the chest: a Red Jewel, which I send off to the Jeweler Gem immediately!</p>
<p>Like all apparitions, I go through Kara! She&#39;s asking where Will is...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/gtqOzoW.png alt="kara will where" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I go back to where Will woke up. The door&#39;s still locked!</p>
<p>Heading down the stairs, down two floors below!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/fHRh9Iv.png alt="soft voice?" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Hmmm...it seems some of our allies might be alive...</p>
<p><strong>Strange voice:</strong> &quot;This is the <strong>Palace of Vampires</strong>...The fountain in this palace produces demons continuously...&quot; The heck is going on?</p>
<p>There&#39;s plenty of skeletons walking about, but no signs of life...</p>
<p>At the end of the corridor, there&#39;s two sets of stairs...I take the one going up.</p>
<p>Upstairs, Will hears someone in the room west of him.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>There&#39;s Erik, or rather, a ghost of Erik!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/yjStDzD.png alt="erik ghost!" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Is Erik&#39;s ghost trapped in the palace?</p>
<p>This must mean Lilly, Neil, and Lance are also stuck as spirits in this palace...</p>
<p>At the other end of the hall, I get another Red Jewel!</p>
<p>Back up and down to the next set of stairs, Will hears more voices...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/dPBLeWw.png alt="vampire fountain" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Why is the vampire talking about the fountain in this palace? Are they asking us to free them?</p>
<p><strong>Strange voice:</strong> &quot;The stone is there...Hurry! Hurry!&quot;</p>
<p>A stone?</p>
<p>I head to the far end of the hallway...where I see...</p>
<p>Lilly! Alive and well!</p>
<p>She jumps in fright at the sight of Will!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/L8gWU5u.png alt=lilly! width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Lilly:</strong> &quot;I practically had a heart attack!!&quot;</p>
<p>She mentions that she saw Erik in the same room we went to. She knows that Erik&#39;s see-through too.</p>
<p><strong>Lilly:</strong> &quot;And he seems to be unconscious, as if his spirit is lost...Let&#39;s stick together. We don&#39;t know what will happen.&quot;</p>
<p>She transforms into a fairy and flies into Will&#39;s pocket.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>There&#39;s two staircases, both going down.</p>
<p>The first one leads into a dead end...</p>
<p>The architecture of the palace looks pretty nice, though it feels haunted. Plus, the underwater seascape outside adds onto the mysterious beauty here.</p>
<p>We haven&#39;t seen Neil or Lance yet in the palace. Could they, or their ghosts, be deeper in the palace?</p>
<p>Taking the second set of stairs down, and another set, going deeper in the Seaside Palace...</p>
<p>Downstairs, <strong>that voice</strong> talks to Will again.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/j6fJ8g0.png alt="purification stone" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The vampire wants a Purification Stone. To cure their vampirism? Or to have us destroy it for them?</p>
<p>I have Will run around the hall of this floor. There&#39;s only one way down...</p>
<p>We&#39;re now at the bottom of the palace.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/62RBcg8.png alt="bottom of palace" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Climbing down the long stairway to the sunken bottom...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/RiQkmup.png alt="long stairway" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We meet our first monster in the palace: a Blue Slime!</p>
<p>Checking our map, there&#39;s a population of enemies here!</p>
<p>After enemy number 2, I decide to turn the long way back to recover and save at the Dark Space portal before facing them!</p>

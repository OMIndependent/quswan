<p>It&#39;s now only Will and Kara on driftwood...</p>
<p>She asks Will if he&#39;s alright.</p>
<p>I choose the second option.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/jOf389z.png alt="unconscious half a day" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>More than half a day? What happened?</p>
<p><strong>Kara:</strong> &quot;I&#39;ve read about being adrift, but I never thought it would happen to me...disasters sometimes happen suddenly.&quot;</p>
<p>Kara&#39;s pretty calm so far. I wonder where Hamlet is? ...Maybe he&#39;s back in the village.</p>
<p>She tells Will to not be upset. She&#39;s just enjoying being adrift, but she&#39;s hungry, and wants the yak leg we took.</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>We bit off some of the meat. It was better than any food we had.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/nILwMeh.png alt="day two" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Kara&#39;s still in awe at the fish flopping...</p>
<p>I have Will whack his flute at the flopping fish. Kara&#39;s not happy at Will doing that!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/dTiTqVe.png alt="poor fish" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I keep doing it anyway. We need food soon.</p>
<p><strong>Will:</strong> &quot;Time passed slowly, with nothing to break the monotony. Kara just stared at the fish all day. Will couldn&#39;t stand it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>He walked on the raft and talked to Kara many times. A minute seemed like forever. But he could hear the march of time.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/oNCx2eC.png alt="four days!?" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Four days already...</p>
<p>Kara predicts someone&#39;s going to come and help them. Then she notices something behind them...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>It&#39;s a message in a jar!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/3OwM9w5.png alt="msg in bottle" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Oh my god...this literally is set in the Age of Exploration...slavery and all.</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>If anyone reads this, please save us... Sam.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/0RuEym2.png alt="me who needs to be saved" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>What is Kara talking about here?</p>
<p>Now she&#39;s hungry.</p>
<p>Will told her she should have caught the flopping fish from two days ago, but Kara doesn&#39;t like being cruel to fish.</p>
<p>Now they&#39;re having their first argument... <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Kara&#39;s not too fond of eating raw fish.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/r8DqJIO.png alt="have you thought abt the fish?" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Unfortunately, in this context, we&#39;re trying to survive...</p>
<p><strong>Will:</strong> &quot;Kara didn&#39;t say anything all day.&quot;</p>
<p>Now it&#39;s the seventh day. No one&#39;s coming to save us...aaaahhhhh!!!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/iTDGahI.png alt="seventh day" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Will:</strong> &quot;Drifting. First week. a school of fish...he reached the end of his rope. If he didn&#39;t eat more, he thought he would starve...&quot;</p>
<p>I catch more fish, and Will&#39;s health, at one, recovers slowly from eating the fish.</p>
<p>After Will&#39;s regained his full strength, we talk to Kara. Kara apologizes.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ySPQfF2.png alt=sorry width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>She decides to eat fish this time.</p>
<p><strong>Kara:</strong> &quot;Only in peace time can you refuse food you don&#39;t like...&quot; Or probably not...I don&#39;t like wasting food.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I have Will swing his flute to catch more fish.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/5p3PxBJ.png alt="will developing feelings" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Typical...</p>
<p>Now it&#39;s the twelfth day adrift. No sign of Lilly, Lance, Erik, or Seth. Nighttime.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/HvSojao.png alt="stars are beautiful" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Kara:</strong> &quot;If I were taller, I could reach them. Surely Lilly and Lance are looking at the same star-studded sky...If I could talk to the stars, I could find out where everyone is...&quot;</p>
<p>She&#39;s also knowledgeable on astronomy as well, mentioning an extra star near the constellation Cygnus.</p>
<p>The extra star&#39;s a red one...oh no...</p>
<p>She asks if they can wish upon the red star.</p>
<p>She has Will close his eyes.</p>
<p>Will makes his wish.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/NYP1QVY.png alt="will wishes" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Kara leans closer to Will...</p>
<p>Now it&#39;s been two and a half weeks adrift at sea. Technically, 18 days.</p>
<p>Kara notices Will&#39;s hair&#39;s gotten longer. She giggles.</p>
<p>Will notices that Kara&#39;s also gone through some character development. Character development yay!</p>
<p>But Kara notices something &quot;terrible...in the water!&quot;</p>
<p>Oh no...</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/aVSAxlX.png alt="shark fins" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Kara thinks it&#39;s sharks.</p>
<p>The battle music plays again.</p>
<p>We wait for the sharks to surface...</p>
<p>She notices something about the sharks, though...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/WhZr4j3.png alt=circling width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Will suggests thinking and waiting it out.</p>
<p>After attacking the circling sharkfins for awhile, which does nothing, Kara realizes something.</p>
<p><strong>Kara:</strong> &quot;I&#39;ve got it! <strong>They&#39;re not hungry!!</strong> My grandpa told me that only humans attack living things when they&#39;re not hungry.&quot;<br>
<strong>Will:</strong> &quot;Then what we&#39;re doing is not usual human behavior. We didn&#39;t eat fish until we were starving.&quot;</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/JeFV9xQ.png alt="goodbye sharks" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The sharks begin to leave.</p>
<p>And now it&#39;s sunset on the third week.</p>
<p>Will and Kara are still out at sea.</p>
<p>Kara mentions the beauty of the sunsets. Pidge would just shrug that off since they happen everyday. More VLD references again!</p>
<p><strong>Kara:</strong> &quot;When I was in the castle, I loved watching the sun set...The sunset was so beautiful from the corridor of the castle...&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Kara:</strong> &quot;But now I&#39;ve come to hate it. After the sun has set, the darkness comes...I thought I&#39;d never see the sunrise again...But since you&#39;re with me, I see a beautiful sunrise every morning.&quot; Awww...</p>
<p>Now it gets a bit romantic...</p>
<p>But...Will keels over! Oh no!</p>

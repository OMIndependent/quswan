<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>None of the soldiers walking around can&#39;t speak to us. More of Elinee&#39;s work...</p>
<p>With the party&#39;s entire weight on the switchpad, the bridge is revealed!</p>
<p>After taking care of an Eye Spy, we&#39;re now in a room with two staircases just like in the first floor...</p>
<p>Except the end has three doors instead of two heading somewhere...</p>
<p>More Eye Spies and Chobin Hoods are also here as well!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/P2Ps7Wo.png alt="eye spy and chobin hood again" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Now which door to take? No hints so far...I wonder if the rooms are randomized so that each room&#39;s different to another player who’s played through this game?</p>
<p>After taking the west door, and running into three bat monsters, we go back and take the center door.</p>
<p>With another Eye Spy quickly taken care of, Hero presses another button moving a wall out of the way...</p>
<p>Past the doorway now, and by the bookshelves, it seems we&#39;ve entered the Witch&#39;s Lair.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Vye8KIG.png alt="in witch's lair" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog> </p>
<p>The music&#39;s now playing a remix of the battle theme, &quot;Into the Thick of It.&quot; It&#39;s exhilarating, yet more ominous...</p>
<p>We take care of the Polter Chairs blocking the staircase, and we meet Elinee.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/TOyPVgB.png alt="noisy children remark" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>She runs off to the next doorway...</p>
<p>She&#39;s now in front of Major Dyluck. What is she doing?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/bViUAkB.png alt="send to thanatos" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Thanatos? Oh no...she&#39;s going to sap his energy!</p>
<p>Instead, she makes the Major vanish!</p>
<p>Pidge is not happy. Elinee tells her he just sent him into the ruins south of Pandora, since he&#39;s strong enough to resist Elinee&#39;s magic, and that this Thanatos person wants him...</p>
<p>Elinee explains who or what Thanatos is.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/gHVk6JY.png alt="thanatos agent" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Oh my god...could this Thanatos person be working for the Empire?</p>
<p>But Elinee tells us we&#39;re too late.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Qqqo4hF.png alt="storm pandora" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Now Elinee summons her &quot;cute, little&quot; pet Spikey!</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The gates open, and Spikey quickly rolls out of the pen, leaving Max and Hero unconscious!</p>
<p>Spikey’s a tiger, or a <strong>Spikey Tiger!</strong></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/W1Z6Pn3.png alt="spikey on the prowl" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Spikey’s now on the prowl...</p>
<p>I switch to Pidge!</p>
<p>Spikey can also breathe fire!</p>
<p>Now, how to take care of this monster...</p>
<p>When he&#39;s in the middle, he can be attacked, but when he rolls into a ball, he&#39;s unstoppable!</p>
<p>Spikey&#39;s Fire Breath can&#39;t be dodged!</p>
<p>When he leaps and rolls, the shaking caused by Spikey&#39;s landing stops the whole party!</p>
<p>I adjust tactics to ensure everyone stays away from Spikey, but to continue attacking him from a distance!</p>
<p>Lucky I can douse anyone who&#39;s been burnt by Spikey&#39;s fiery breath with a Magical Herb!</p>
<p>Spikey also drops a Fire Bouquet on Max, which decreases his attack!</p>
<p>I have Hero reequip the Sword.</p>
<p>He starts his rollout attacks again...nearly taking care of Max, and knocking him and Hero out temporarily!</p>
<p>But they get up and we take Spikey out!</p>

<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/jx07Ban.png alt="spikey finish 2" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We get a <strong>Boomerang Orb!</strong></p>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/JcG4lls1Xuo>The music changes into joyful celebration!</a></p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Now where&#39;s Elinee?</p>
<p>We head back down, where the witch is!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/6MyE8Gu.png alt="elinee bookcase" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Elinee shrieks in surprise and begs us to forgive her. She transforms into a...smaller, less intimidating appearance...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/5Bz4vqk.png alt="witch transform" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Because of the lack of herbs in the forest, Elinee notes that she&#39;s been trading Pandora&#39;s townsfolk for herbs from Thanatos!</p>
<p>So it was Thanatos&#39;s doing that caused Elinee to turn evil...</p>
<p>She decides to &quot;live peacefully&quot; as a &quot;normal, elderly lady&quot; from now on.</p>
<p>Elinee calls Major Dyluck &quot;that other kid,&quot; telling us that the Major&#39;s in the ruins.</p>
<p>She hands us more treasures from the chests east of the room, and a tip to get to the Underground Palace: to get there, we need ice magic.</p>
<p>Elinee&#39;s lost her magic powers now and can&#39;t teach us (or Pidge or Max) any ice magic...</p>
<p>We get a new weapon, the <strong>Whip</strong>, and 50 gold!</p>
<p>Now that we have the Whip, we can leave the forest easily!</p>
<p>The castle&#39;s monsters have vanished as well!</p>
<p>All of the soldiers have escaped too...only Neko&#39;s left.</p>
<p>We buy more stuff and save before leaving the castle.</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Outside, Pidge yells that Dyluck is still alive, <a href=https://youtu.be/3dhpIEerwng>accompanied with pretty music</a>.</p>
<p>But a voice calls Hero&#39;s name...it&#39;s Luka.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/TNFD3UZ.png alt="luka voice" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Pidge decides to join Hero, to accompany him to rescue the Major. Max also officially joins in our quest!</p>
<p>Traveling back, I use the Magic Rope next to the poles to get to the portal leading to the Water Palace.</p>
<p>Instead, it takes us back to the portal from Elinee’s castle.</p>
<p>We make it back again and I have Hero use the Whip instead...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/wGsDxUD.png alt="hop and skip" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>A hop and a skip away!</p>
<p>And we&#39;re back!</p>
<p>This Whip has quite a reach!</p>
<p>We save at Neko&#39;s inn, who&#39;s made it back to his front desk! I wonder how he makes it from place to place so quickly...</p>

<p>I forgot to put up the Mana Seeds I&#39;ve enchanted so far last session, so here they are...</p>

<p>Into the castle of Tasnica we go!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/wukvYbo.png alt="castle of tasnica" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/ZSYI-l3ISNw>Here&#39;s the theme for the Republic of Tasnica</a>. It&#39;s the same theme as the sandship.</p>
<p>We find Jema inside, and notes that he &quot;hardly recognized&quot; Hero! Character development yay!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/zsSMgqS.png alt="imperial spy" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>An Imperial spy after the King? I wonder who could it be?</p>
<p>Every guard at the front hall is looking for the spy. I&#39;m more concerned about where Sage Joch is...</p>
<p>Very nice tapestry work at the end of the front hall here.</p>
<p>I go into the small door in the east wing. The guard here is also trying to find the Imperial spy...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/AxYW4IL.png alt="door north" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Now to the door northwards, where we&#39;re at the grand staircase.</p>
<p>I go to the west hall.</p>
<p>I have some feeling that this castle could end up being a dungeon of monsters soon...</p>
<p>Heading down, I&#39;m back at the front entrance hall.</p>
<p>Now back at the grand staircase, I go into the small room near the west hall. This must probably be the king&#39;s quarters...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/xmEJURd.png alt="king's quarters" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I now go up the grand staircase and into the throne room, where we don&#39;t get the most pleasant of welcomes.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/h6bkQKQ.png alt="you must be spies" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The King tells his guards to toss us into the dungeon!</p>
<p>But a guard notices that the King is an impostor! The Imperial spy is posing as the King!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/QdAt3jv.png alt="that's not the king" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The King impostor has his back towards us, knowing his plan is ruined...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/JEB5jOX.png alt="king impostor" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>He vanishes all the guards!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ZYTzD89.png alt="king ?" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>King Impostor:</strong> &quot;Think I&#39;ll have you destroy the King!&quot;<br>
<strong>Hero:</strong> &quot;Think again!&quot;</p>
<p>Now we have to face another boss!</p>
<p>The King Impostor summons a ninja clad in black, the <strong>Dark Stalker!</strong></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/RcCe2Xs.png alt="dark stalker" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The Dark Stalker imbues his weapon with ice!</p>
<p>But we take care of him easily with a Lucent Beam!</p>
<p>We wake the King up from his manipulation by the Imperial spy!</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I talk to the guards. One guard mentions that the navy of Tasnica is all but spent, the only ship available is the sandship. Another mentions that Jema was a leading commander for Tasnica.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/YUR9zbJ.png alt=serin width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I&#39;m thinking Serin might&#39;ve been the previous hero that wielded the Mana sword, and probably the ghost that Hero met that told him to take out the sword.</p>
<p>So after the death of Serin, Jema retired...</p>
<p><strong>Jema:</strong> &quot;Well done! Your Highness, Hero has beaten the spy.&quot;</p>
<p>The King is still in slight disbelief at Hero&#39;s skill.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/x6lpSvb.png alt="can't believe" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>But he&#39;s not worried anymore after Hero took care of the Imperial spy.</p>
<p>He rewards us with a <strong>Sword&#39;s Orb!</strong></p>
<p>More info from the other guards flanking the King that I know about already...that the Dark Stalker&#39;s emitting something evil, and that Pandora and Tasnica are allies.</p>
<p>We speak to Jema again.</p>
<p><strong>Jema:</strong> &quot;You have learned much, but you can&#39;t rest yet. You still have to learn what true courage is.&quot;</p>
<p>The party nods. What Jema says next isn&#39;t good.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/uRJpbm9.png alt="empire now has fortress" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Jema:</strong> &quot;If the Empire is being aggressive, it means they almost have the Fortress. I&#39;m off to fight the Empire wherever I can. You must find the Sage Joch. From him, you&#39;ll learn true courage.&quot; </p>
<p>Where <strong>is</strong> the Sage, though?</p>
<p>He leaves the throne room.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We talk to the King next.</p>
<p>The King tells us that Jema&#39;s &quot;studying the power of Mana.&quot;</p>
<p>From one guard at the foot of the staircase, he states that the Empire and Republic are getting closer to war...</p>
<p>Another guard tells us that Jema and Serin were the best warriors of the land.</p>
<p>An old woman with green hair knows Hero from somewhere before...</p>
<p>Most of the civilians are back in the castle now.</p>
<p>Another man at the entrance hall tells us about the Empire&#39;s next move.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/arTDlYu.png alt="sunken continent" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I&#39;m guessing that sunken continent must be where the Mana Fortress is...</p>
<p><strong>Man:</strong> &quot;Only the world&#39;s Mana Seeds, which seal the continent, stand in their way.&quot;</p>
<p>A girl points out Max as &quot;tiny&quot;, and Max calls her the tiny one!</p>
<p>Now that everything here&#39;s settled, I head back to the Lofty Mountains and see if Sage Joch is in his cave.</p>

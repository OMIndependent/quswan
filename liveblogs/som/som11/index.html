<p>Now our next mission is to head off to rescue Major Dyluck from the witch Elinee!</p>
<p>I wonder how Pidge fights, but so far, she&#39;s doing nothing.</p>
<p>By using the &quot;Targeting&quot; option, I now have her attack the Mushboom, but the monster&#39;s on the other side of the river!</p>
<p>We manage to cross the bridge and take care of the cute mushroom monster. Yay, teamwork!</p>
<p>We use the little yellow creature to bounce us up the cliff, saving us precious time.</p>
<p>Pidge also gets poisoned by the Lullabud here! I realize what the Magical Herb does, and use it on Pidge!</p>
<p>We manage to make it to Neko&#39;s inn. That was a quick trip!</p>
<p>Refreshed and ready, we take care of some more monsters and head off to the set of pillars near the Water Palace...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/AoYv3pn.png alt="portal to forest" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>This is it, I think!</p>
<p>Entering the area inside the pillars now...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/FaJHj2T.png alt="forest entrance" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Hmmm, we&#39;re now in a really foggy place...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/OgGTN3k.png alt="rope side missing" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Unfortunately, we&#39;re stuck, since we need a rope of some kind to go to the other side. I notice on the other side, arrows are being fired at us!</p>
<p>With nowhere to go, I head to the Water Palace first, hopefully to get some advice from Luka.</p>
<p>She tells us the same thing: head for Gaia&#39;s Navel first.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We head back to Pandora.</p>
<p>On the way, we build our strength as we take care of more monsters...</p>
<p>After fixing Pidge&#39;s Action Grid a bit, she can now attack the enemy without me targeting!</p>
<p>As Hero gets KO&#39;d temporarily, Pidge keeps fighting the Mushbooms!</p>
<p>Back at Pandora! Now, let&#39;s see where the south gate is...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/dFML7RA.png alt="south gate here" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We&#39;re now near the ruins, where a statue greets us.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/y1FUi87.png alt="friendly statue" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>That&#39;s definitely a friendly statue!</p>
<p>Into the dry ruins, where we see people wander about aimlessly, none of them wanting to talk.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/PZ25aYi.png alt=ruins width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The architecture looks pretty stark, like it&#39;s a bit out of place for this game, but at the same time, it feels naturally in place for some reason. I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m writing about at this point.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/qSKeNJU.png alt="mask arch" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Now where to head to next?</p>
<p>After buying another herb, I have the party head out to the west exit.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Everyone&#39;s armed and ready!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/sJpW9bl.png alt="armed and ready" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>There&#39;s another new monster in town, and it&#39;s a flying one: a <strong>Buzz Bee!</strong></p>
<p>Pidge&#39;s weapons level up, and for some reason, a sound effect that sounds familiar to me plays.</p>
<p>Oh my god, what are you doing, Pidge? Stop hitting the rock! You&#39;re getting injured!</p>
<p>We head further west, where we&#39;re now at a grassy meadow filled with tall rocks, and tons of monsters...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/p0KZNcT.png alt="grassy meadow" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I adjust the action grid to ensure that Pidge is a bit more careful when attacking monsters this time...</p>
<p>And a Lullabud and a Buzz Bee give us more of a hard time, as the Bee&#39;s also a poisoner!</p>
<p>More monsters to take care of now!</p>
<p>I seem to be getting the hang of how the battle system works!</p>
<p>Here&#39;s another scenery shot!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/fcFjNi5.png alt="scenery shot" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>More monsters to fight now, and the Buzz Bee&#39;s really quick!</p>
<p>After more fights with Rabites and Mushbooms in more grassy meadows, I read the nearest sign...it seems we&#39;re close to our destination!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/LPkOBLg.png alt="sign next" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I have our heroes head up north to Gaia&#39;s Navel.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Or not, as we cross into more flowers and blossoms along the way, along with more Buzz Bees and Lullabuds.</p>
<p>I have Hero try to flee from the fliers, until we stop at the edge of the cliffside.</p>
<p>Moving forward, we read another sign, where <strong>Gaia&#39;s Navel</strong> is south, and a <strong>Haunted Forest</strong> is up north.</p>
<p>We then take care of another Buzz Bee and Lullabud climbing up the stairs!</p>
<p>East near a waterfall, and more Buzz Bees appear! Aaaaaajfksjfajsljwrjfn!!!</p>
<p>I have Hero and Pidge climb down, where <strong>more</strong> Buzz Bees come, but they can&#39;t attack us since they&#39;re either above or below us!</p>
<p>Now at the falls...which waterfall should I head into? The west or the east?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/bjirJcV.png alt=waterfalls width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>But I can&#39;t jump there, and instead, head west to solid ground again, as more Buzz Bees ambush me!</p>
<p>I turn back, trying to figure out where the entrance to Gaia&#39;s Navel is...</p>
<p>I cross over to the falls east of where I read the Haunted Forest sign.</p>
<p>After more battles, we&#39;re now in a log bridge of sorts...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/NcoVNZX.png alt="log bridge" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Crossing that, it looks like we&#39;re now back at the start of the area!</p>
<p>After a Lullabud ambush, Hero&#39;s low on health! I use up another Candy...</p>
<p>We make our way back down through the falls and push back the Buzz Bee brigade...</p>
<p>Now which way is Gaia&#39;s Navel?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/spBjDkP.png alt="which tunnel" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I take the left entrance this time...</p>
<p>I also have Pidge equip the Sword.</p>

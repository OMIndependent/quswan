<p>I need to think of or find a better strategy before tackling this dungeon again...</p>
<p>Reading a few guides and the wiki online, I learn a few things: it turns out that <a href=http://mana.wikia.com/wiki/Wall_Face_Boss_Line#Wall_Face>this wall hates earth spells</a>...too bad Max ran out of MP when I faced it! Plus, <a href=https://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/588646-secret-of-mana/46477811>the Tomato Men can only be affected nonmagically by charged attacks...</a></p>
<p>I also find out when reading the <a href=https://snesrpggaming.weebly.com/bestiary-bosses.html>bosses section of this guide</a> (I almost spoiled myself there) that only Faerie Walnuts restore MP...now I know what to get before taking on the Pandora Ruins again.</p>
<p>I decide to go all the way to Neko&#39;s to get more Faerie Walnuts...</p>
<p>I take control of Max and demo an Earth Slide on a nearby Mushboom. It costs 3 MP to cast, a bit expensive...</p>
<p>Sadly, I only have enough to get two Walnuts, so I buy one and get more Chocolate...</p>
<p>I head back to Pandora building up the party&#39;s magic skill as I go...</p>
<p>It&#39;s also the first time I use Pidge&#39;s Speed Up on everyone, but it lasts for a short time...</p>

<hr>
<p>I enter the ruins again.</p>
<p>Now that I&#39;m better prepared, I take on the Tomato Man and Zombies. I have Pidge imbue Ice magic on everyone&#39;s weapons first.</p>
<p>I finally get a physical hit on the Tomato Man!</p>

<p>The Zombie&#39;s reaction is hilarious!</p>
<p>This time, from the guides online, I check the west and east doors in the entrance hall...</p>
<p>West door first, where I&#39;m greeted by more Evil Swords...I use Hero&#39;s charge attack to take care of the first one...and we go after the second one!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/WE5uu7H.png alt="statue ominous" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>That statue still doesn&#39;t look ominous, nope, not at all...</p>
<p>After failing to win in a rematch against the Tomato Man and the Zombies he spawns, I head over to the east room.</p>
<p>Inside there&#39;s two Evil Swords which we take care of with Hero&#39;s charged attacks, and another Tomato Man!</p>
<p>We fall back to the main hallway...</p>
<p>I somehow manage to get a charged hit on the Tomato Man, but his spells overpower us and I have the party retreat outside!</p>

<p>The ruins&#39; grounds are deserted...did Thanatos warp them inside?</p>
<p>That creepy music&#39;s still playing even as we leave the ruins...</p>
<p>Now we&#39;re back in Pandora...</p>
<p>I decide to use the cannon to get back to Gaia&#39;s Navel and into the Dwarf Village again.</p>
<p>I buy another Spiky Suit for Max, and head back via cannon to the Water Palace to get another Faerie Walnut from Neko&#39;s shop...</p>
<p>I take a rest and save...</p>
<p>Now for some level and money grinding around the woods and the ruins. To take on that Wall again, I&#39;ll have to get 3 Faerie Walnuts...</p>
<p>Back to fighting the Evil Swords in the west room, I have Max cast Energy Absorb and Gem Missile for the first time!</p>
<p>The Gem Missile&#39;s more quicker than the Earth Slide, I think...</p>
<p>Back to the entrance hall where Max&#39;s ice magic levels up!</p>
<p>After a few battles (where I use up all of Max&#39;s MP!), I take a cannon and head to Neko&#39;s again, buy the last Faerie Walnut I want, and save and stop here, knowing I&#39;ve built up the party&#39;s magic skills a fair amount...</p>
<p>Neko&#39;s prices are really pricey.</p>

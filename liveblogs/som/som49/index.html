<p>Let&#39;s hope I rescue the Major in tonight&#39;s session!</p>
<p>We take to the center door!</p>
<p>Ghouls and Specters, oh my!</p>
<p>After more fighting with Wizard Eyes, we go down the stairs to face off against a trio of Grave Bats!</p>
<p>I switch Hero&#39;s weapon to the bow, now that he&#39;s gained a level in the Spear!</p>
<p>Oh great, stuck in a corner again, and we&#39;re getting attacked!</p>
<p>I use Max&#39;s magic to get us out of that tight spot, and we eventually take care of them!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/sVVxC3L.png alt="empty room" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Next room, we face off against the RGB Drops Brigade (or the Red, Green, and Blue Drops Brigade)!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/6lbkaFb.png alt="rgb drops" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The Green Drop&#39;s the easiest to go down!</p>
<p>The Red Drop&#39;s the last one out!</p>
<p>I realize that I only have two Walnuts and make the hard turnaround back to town!</p>
<p>After restocking on Walnuts, I buy a Tiger Mask, Suit, and a Frosty Ring!</p>
<p>I equip, sell, and rest-and-save.</p>
<p>Now we&#39;re a little more prepared for this ruin!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Everyone so far&#39;s at level 32.</p>
<p>We make it back and brush through the wave of enemies until we go to the south end of the hallway.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/oQqNlQr.png alt="ghoul hall" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>After a short fight, the Ghouls speed themselves up! We take care of them quickly!</p>
<p>We pass through the door a duo of Robin Foots are guarding!</p>
<p>After passing a hall of bats, we end up in an empty office!</p>
<p>We turn back and proceed west.</p>
<p>Into another door, and into a hall of Blue and Green Drops!</p>
<p>The door beyond goes down this time.</p>
<p>But the way&#39;s blocked by two Ghouls and an Imp!</p>
<p>The arrow carpet&#39;s back too...the composition of both the enemies and party here make this feel like a <em>Chrono Trigger</em> battle!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/zpP43II.png alt="arrow carpet" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Westward, I see something I really did not expect to see again...spikes!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/7JqqvA8.png alt="spikes yikes" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>After a battle with eye enemies, the whole party&#39;s now leveled up their weapon skills!</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We go further south to a dead end!</p>
<p>We turn back and take a turn south...</p>
<p>Northwards leads us back to the entrance. Taking the staircase down leads us to a passage blocked by spikes!</p>
<p>In the next room a Blue Drop, an LA Funk, and a Dark Funk await!</p>
<p>While charging the sword, the Blue Drops turn Pidge into a snowperson!</p>
<p>Into a door, where more enemies are!</p>
<p>After they&#39;re gone, I have Pidge push the switch.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/w4LLcaI.png alt="distant noise" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I&#39;m thinking something might&#39;ve happened to the spikes in the previous room...</p>
<p>I&#39;m right! All the spikes have been lowered!</p>
<p>I approach the northern chamber.</p>
<p>There&#39;s more Ghouls and a chest too!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/j4P18FO.png alt="sword's orb" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Yes, that means we can now upgrade the Sword!</p>
<p>But during my celebration, a Ghoul leaps on Pidge, poisoning her!</p>
<p>We escape, and climb down the stairs, and press the switch down there!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/OvZ4dzj.png alt="door appears" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Why does my curiosity get the better of me again?</p>
<p>Now we&#39;re on the lower level, on the other side of the area...</p>
<p>At the south room, we run down the stairs to another floor. </p>
<p><strong>How deep does this ruin go?</strong></p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>After finishing off more Ghouls, I check Pidge&#39;s weapon level stats, then equip her with the Spear!</p>
<p>Wonderful, we&#39;re now at a maze of spikes!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Omse73b.png alt="maze of spikes" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I carefully make the party&#39;s way across the mini-maze, take care of the stray Imp, and press the switch to lower them!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/hKVJvbe.png alt="double doors" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Those doors beyond must be where Thanatos and the Major are...</p>
<p>Knowing that I&#39;ll be facing a tough battle, I do some short preparations...</p>
<p>More enemies come forth on the other side of the doors!</p>
<p>I dash Hero down the stairs, and see more Robin Foots, who are no match for the party...</p>
<p>Let&#39;s see if this hall actually leads to where the Major and Thanatos are...</p>
<p>Instead, the hall ends at a set of double doors...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/QC3a9A1.png alt="doom's wall" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>...and inside, we&#39;re greeted by another wall monster, one of Thanatos&#39;s &quot;pets&quot;!</p>
<p>The wall monster&#39;s a <strong>Doom&#39;s Wall</strong>. I start off by having Max fire the first spell at it! No good, as the wall heals itself, blocking Max&#39;s spell!</p>
<p>Its two Doom&#39;s Eyes wake up!</p>
<p>The spells seem to connect...</p>
<p>Doom&#39;s Wall does not like fire spells!</p>
<p>Now this is a new trick: Doom&#39;s Wall uses <strong>Confuse Hoops</strong> on Hero!</p>
<p>Doom&#39;s Wall can also cast Thunderbolt!</p>
<p>Max is down to 1 MP! There goes the last of our Walnuts...</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Using an Exploder spell on the entire wall now...</p>
<p>It&#39;s not very effective...</p>
<p>Doom&#39;s Wall heals itself again!</p>
<p>Analyzing the wall monster, I learn that it&#39;s weak to Lumina&#39;s magic! So Lumina must be another Elemental...</p>
<p>Since the wall&#39;s almost finished, I spam more Fireballs at it!</p>
<p>The fireworks show begins to start...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/6bU0HxT.png alt="doom wall fireworks" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>...and he&#39;s taken care of!</p>
<p>We get a <strong>Whip&#39;s Orb!</strong></p>
<p>We proceed further to the double doors ahead.</p>
<p>More cultists wander around here...</p>
<p>On the top of the dais is...<strong>Major Dyluck!</strong></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/cPHWbTa.png alt="door forward" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>There&#39;s also a door forward, but it&#39;s locked.</p>
<p>I have Pidge take the lead this time.</p>
<p>I wonder why are our weapons still out? There&#39;s no enemies here...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/YnwQ99u.png alt="at last" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Is he overjoyed to see us?</p>
<p><strong>Pidge:</strong> &quot;Dyluck...I&#39;m so glad to see you!&quot;</p>
<p><a name=6></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Whoa, <strong>what the!?</strong></p>
<p>Pidge is now taken in by the reaper, and she&#39;s not coming back! She disappears...</p>
<p><strong>Max:</strong> &quot;Bring her back, now!&quot;</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/DxmtQF0.png alt=help width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Help!? For what!?</p>
<p><strong>Hero:</strong> &quot;You can&#39;t be serious! She loves you! I can&#39;t handle this!&quot;</p>
<p>Hero aims his javelin at Dyluck, knocking him back to his senses!</p>
<p>Dyluck, now back to his old self (maybe?), tells us to go through the door behind him.</p>
<p>Hero and Max come to Pidge&#39;s aid, but are thrown back...by Thanatos!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/qOeMPj4.png alt="stick around" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Thanatos:</strong> &quot;Her life force is strong! She&#39;ll...<strong>hey! What the...!?</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>A golden light glows and Pidge comes to...the gang&#39;s back together once more!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/tljfOu4.png alt="dyluck power" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Looks like Dyluck&#39;s back to his former self after all! </p>
<p><strong>Thanatos:</strong> &quot;Who does he think he&#39;s toying with?&quot;</p>
<p>Another voice fills the air...is it Thanatos?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/PexIL2g.png alt="vampire come forth" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The voice summons a <strong>Vampire!</strong> V erpbtavmr guvf zbafgre sebz <em>Fjbeq bs Znan</em>, erzrzorevat ubj gevpxl ur jnf gurer!</p>
<p><a name=7></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Max tries to cast a Fireball, but it doesn&#39;t connect!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/VjsMci6.png alt="vampire 1" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/8Gp6OC5.png alt="vampire 2" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Now the Vampire floats around...</p>
<p>How do you attack this boss?</p>
<p>Another Fireball seems to do the trick.</p>
<p>Analyzing this monster, he&#39;s weak against the same kind of magic the Doom&#39;s Wall is...</p>
<p>He casts a freezing spell on Max!</p>
<p>Ah! While boosting Max&#39;s defense, the Vampire takes a bite out of Hero!</p>
<p>The Vampire&#39;s a quick, fierce jumper!</p>
<p>And he takes another bite out of Hero!</p>
<p>This boss can cast a wide variety of spells! He tries to Sleep Ring Pidge, but that fails!</p>
<p>What weapons can hit this monster?</p>
<p>The Bow of Hope is best for evil or undead enemies.</p>
<p>But it doesn&#39;t even work!</p>
<p>Every time Max fires a spell, the Vampire counters it with one of his own!</p>
<p>More spellcasting duels and running around...with some sleeping magic from the Vampire connecting...</p>
<p>There&#39;s the last of Max magic!</p>
<p>And after awhile, Pidge&#39;s magic is completely gone, and this Vampire&#39;s still alive!</p>
<p><a name=8></a></p>
<hr>
<p>When he&#39;s floating, he&#39;s untouchable to the party&#39;s attacks!</p>
<p>We continue attacking him the moment he touches down!</p>
<p>He can also poison the party with a touch too!</p>
<p>I use up the last of our Chocolate Bars, but then a miracle happens as the Vampire lands!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/TI0NRFD.png alt="vampire fireworks" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The Vampire&#39;s gone!</p>
<p>The <strong>Boomerang&#39;s Orb</strong> is our reward!</p>
<p>We go back to the dais, where Major Dyluck has vanished! Pidge calls out to Dyluck...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Sl8V9wM.png alt="where's dyluck" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Pidge:</strong> &quot;<strong>Dyluck!!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/jhzGK0I.png alt="let's go" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/FXJnqYE.png alt="we will find him" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>No...</strong></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/o1dpVLZ.jpg alt="ahiru crying" width=375 height=281.25></p>
<p>We head back to Northtown by Magic Rope, with me exhausted, both from the back-to-back boss battles and the aftermath...</p>
<p>Maybe Pidge struck the final blow on the Vampire since I was controlling Max when I healed her...</p>
<p>I&#39;ll be honest, that Vampire was the trickiest and longest boss I&#39;ve ever faced so far in this game, whfg yvxr va Fjbeq bs Znan...</p>

<p>Now that I&#39;m sort of prepared this time, I decide to head off to the ruins.</p>
<p>I&#39;m still continuing to build up my party&#39;s magic on the way to Pandora...</p>
<p>I rest at the inn there and we&#39;re off!</p>
<p>I take care of the Tomato Man and his zombie minions at the entrance hall...</p>
<p>Just a little bit more and Max gets a level up for his Gnome, or earth, magic...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/5nXSrK2.png alt="magic stats" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I continue to spam Freeze and Gem Missile at the Chess Knights in the next room...</p>
<p>Now back down to the foggy depths of the ruin...</p>
<p>We slowly fight our way to the end of the hallway...</p>
<p>Then head up to the northern stray room and take care of some more enemies...</p>
<p>Back again to the hall, and we find ourselves in another dilemma: two Tomato Men!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/YDdwlRS.png alt="tomato men" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Not a problem, as I have Max target the Freeze spell on both of them!</p>
<p>It&#39;s also the first time I use Pidge&#39;s Remedy spell, as she gets poisoned by a Zombie&#39;s breath! </p>
<p>Downstairs now...</p>
<p>I mentioned last time that the flooring in this part of the ruin looked different. I wonder why the developers used this flooring?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/rH4Iw0d.png alt="flooring arrows" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>In any case, we take care of more Tomato Men and Zombies, and head down the stairs to take care of more of the same!</p>
<p>Now for the last fleet of enemies in this long hall...it&#39;s slower to finish off a Tomato Man with physical attacks than it does with magic, and they have to be charged attacks.</p>
<p>Another bout with a Tomato Man again, and it&#39;s a bit longer this time!</p>
<p>I also realize that when the Tomato Man casts Defender, if he has no minions to cast it on, it targets us!</p>
<p>And I think that&#39;s the last of them!</p>
<p>But, I have to go back all the way to Neko&#39;s since I&#39;m low on Walnuts again...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/y71DjBG.png alt="heading back out" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The enemies have respawned again!</p>
<p>The Chess Knights can also speed themselves up!</p>
<p>For awhile, the Chess Knights have us cornered and almost finish us off! By taking control of Max, we manage to escape!</p>
<p>We stay at the inn, reviving Pidge!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/XVSt9ti.png alt="inn rest max" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I notice that the character I&#39;m controlling sleeps at the leftmost bed!</p>
<p>Now off to Neko&#39;s to get more Walnuts!</p>
<p>Out of curiosity, I decide to buy a Barrel as well...</p>
<p>Now back again to those tough ruins!</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Everyone&#39;s getting stronger...</p>
<p>After beating a Tomato Man, he drops a quickly scurrying chest that has a Faerie Walnut! Yessss!</p>
<p>I&#39;m betting the reason why the chest is running away from us immediately is because it knows it has something valuable!</p>
<p>Aha! I boost Max&#39;s water magic up to Level 2!!!</p>
<p>Heading down to the last hall, we take on more enemies...</p>
<p>After Max takes care of two Tomato Men in separate locations, his earth magic is now strong enough to face the boss!</p>
<p>And even more monsters...</p>
<p>For a bit of fun, I use Energy Absorb on a Tomato Man...</p>
<p>Now we&#39;re finally at the basement!</p>
<p>I heal everyone before facing Thanatos again...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/YTScusL.png alt="thanatos face" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Thanatos drops us down to the where the wall boss is again...</p>
<p>Let&#39;s see if I have enough power to face him now...</p>
<p>I take control of Max and cast Gem Missile on the Wall Face...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/iBCVf2F.png alt="ultra effective" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>It&#39;s ultra effective!!!</strong></p>
<p>As the Chamber Eye absorbs Hero&#39;s health, I continue spamming Gem Missile on the Wall Face...</p>
<p>After two more Gem Missiles, the fireworks display occurs...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/xWTorDR.png alt="wall fireworks" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/7YLnGpa.png alt="wall finish" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>...and he&#39;s finished!</p>
<p>I get a <strong>Bow&#39;s Orb!</strong></p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Now we head back up to the dais where Thanatos is, as jubilant victory music plays!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/RbudXB6.png alt="greenberg jedi name" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Thanatos:</strong> &quot;Oh! So you are the ones with the Mana Sword! The villagers are yours, but not these two!&quot; <strong>What!?</strong></p>
<p>Pidge tries to chase after them, but Thanatos vanishes with Dyluck and Phanna!</p>
<p>Thanatos, through the air, has the last words...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/6K67MFK.png alt="mwa ha ha" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Down the steps, we talk to the wandering villagers, where they&#39;re all confused as to where they are...</p>
<p>One person mentions she was doing dishes, then she ended up inside the ruins...</p>
<p>Wait a moment, Jema&#39;s here too!?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/vrbKtGy.png alt=jema!? width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We talk to Jema, who mentions that Thanatos is working for the Empire, as one of their &quot;best men&quot;, indicating that they&#39;re &quot;that desperate to get Mana.&quot;</p>
<p>Jema, however, wonders why Thanatos wants the &quot;life energy&quot; of the people in Pandora...</p>
<p>Jema points out that the Mana Fortress only requires the power of the Mana Seeds, not the people. Unless they might be planning on reviving the Mana Fortress using the people&#39;s life force. Oh god... <img class=emojione alt=â˜¹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Jema says the trademark George Lucas line about Thanatos...</p>
<p>He then tells us to head to the Water Palace to meet with Luka while he goes to the Underground Palace.</p>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/nv4rUFFm8ss>The happy forest music&#39;s now playing</a> as we leave the ruin to head to Pandora.</p>
<p>The innkeeper&#39;s now more active, as he doesn&#39;t tell us to treat ourselves to a bed first this time. He asks for the money upfront.</p>

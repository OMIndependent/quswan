<p>Before going off to see the Resistance, I upgrade my weapons downstairs for 1600 each...</p>
<p><strong>Chain Whip</strong> to <strong>Flail of Hope</strong><br>
<strong>Claymore</strong> to <strong>Excalibur (!)</strong><br>
<strong>Rising Sun</strong> to <strong>Red Cleaver</strong></p>
<p>Now to check the weapon stats and effects here...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/LLGuiTG.png alt="weapon stats so far" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Excalibur fits the bill of &quot;holy sword&quot; as it&#39;s strong against evil and undead enemies! The Flail of Hope also has the same effect.</p>
<p>The Red Cleaver is effective against insects, though.</p>
<p>Entering the HQ, the party looks crestfallen after the disappearance of Dyluck.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/rnbOZYH.png alt=resistance width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Krissie telling us not to give up hope means she has something in mind!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/SfUVUig.png alt="emperor truce" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>What!?</strong> The Emperor now wants a truce between the Resistance!? I am guessing that this might be a trap, knowing how these stories play out.</p>
<p><strong>Krissie:</strong> &quot;He&#39;s saying he wants peace!&quot;</p>
<p>One of her Resistance members is open to hearing the Emperor out. Krissie sounds a bit optimistic at this move! Another member agrees.</p>
<p>Krissie decides that they&#39;ll listen to the Emperor. She offers us to go with her!</p>
<p><strong>Krissie:</strong> &quot;After this meeting, your journey will be over!&quot;</p>
<p>Everyone nods.</p>
<p>The Resistance goes ahead of us.</p>
<p>I restock on more items and equipment.</p>
<p>A lady nearby tells us about the Empire&#39;s territories...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ziKVWYL.png alt="empire territories" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>So probably Gold City&#39;s also part of the Imperial territories.</p>
<p>We exit north to the Imperial Castle.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/DRalT6P.png alt="enter imperial castle" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/rE9epfIp-KI>Here&#39;s the music for the castle.</a></p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I climb up to the western staircase, where a guard blocking the doorway greets us, telling us the Emperor&#39;s expecting our arrival.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/5RtG5Q9.png alt="castle arch" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The castle shows off its old-fashioned grandeur with some sinister architecture around the entrance.</p>
<p>Inside, it looks really gloomy...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Af5QY98.png alt=interior width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The standards and the blue carpet aren&#39;t even trying to cover up the gloominess...</p>
<p>There&#39;s two staircases here. The guards blocking the west staircase point us east...</p>
<p>We continue the climb...</p>
<p>...to a stray room with a door.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/1pDSpyF.png alt="stray room" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We head inside...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/2pswBFY.png alt="dining room" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I knew it!</p>
<p><img src=http://powet.tv/powetblog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/admiral_ackbar_says_its_a_trap.jpg alt="it's a trap" width=426.5 height=240></p>
<p>There&#39;s a huge banquet set up in the hall, but no one&#39;s seated! In the far side of the room...</p>
<p>...there&#39;s the <strong>Emperor</strong>, in a suit of armor!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ZBLjfEb.png alt=emperor width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The guards surround us!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/FvpAo3F.png alt="lucky day in history?" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The Emperor vanishes!</p>
<p>The guards take us!</p>
<p>The Emperor&#39;s evil laughs echo as we get taken into a jail cell!</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ZEDPHIN.png alt="in prison" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Krissie:</strong> &quot;Oh! Emperor Vandole is a <strong>dog</strong>.&quot;</p>
<p>Speaking to a guard, he lets the party go! Hero demands that he let the Resistance free.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/M07hQyo.png alt="let them free" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I don&#39;t think he&#39;s wanting to do that, Hero...</p>
<p>The guard shoves the party down a huge hole!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/CWEVvC1.png alt="into hole" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Into another Mantis Ant monster!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ecde4PZ.png alt="metal mantis boss" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>It&#39;s a <strong>Metal Mantis!</strong></p>
<p>Hero&#39;s Excalibur isn&#39;t doing the trick here...I have Hero and Max swap weapons.</p>
<p>Metal Mantis unleashes a Fire Beam!</p>
<p>The Metal Mantis has no weaknesses, but he&#39;s a big leaper!</p>
<p>This boss keeps KO&#39;ing Max!</p>
<p>Now he does a little dance and casts Gem Missiles on all of us!</p>
<p>The Metal Mantis now defends himself!</p>
<p>After one more Air Blast the fireworks begin! What an easy fight!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/IeuPeiM.png alt="fireworks metal mantis" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Let&#39;s see what our reward is: a <strong>Glove&#39;s Orb</strong>!</p>
<p>I see a platform or a teleporter leading up to the cells...</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We made it back up, where a little yellow guy west of the teleporter awaits!</p>
<p>Nothing north, but I see a chest in the center of the room west of here...</p>
<p>We head down and get its contents: only 1000 gold!</p>
<p>Now we meet sludgy green eyed monsters called the <strong>Embermen</strong>! I can&#39;t tell whether they have two or one eyes though...</p>
<p>Up the stairs we go...</p>
<p>...and we&#39;re back at the prison cell!</p>
<p>Pressing the button on the right, I free the Resistance!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/xgRjfua.png alt="resistance freed" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Krissie tells us the guards ran off to find reinforcements!</p>
<p>The statue knights flanking the door outside are <strong>Armored Men</strong>!</p>
<p>We trek down the stairs to the front of the castle!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/YVTjtCt.png alt="armored men" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>It turns out they&#39;re not fans of fire magic...</p>
<p>We fight our way to the east wing of the castle...</p>
<p>Inside, there&#39;s a trio of Armored Men and a button that I think opens the cell ahead.</p>
<p>Pidge is now at level 3 with the Spear!</p>
<p>I switch her weapon to the whip.</p>
<p>The door ahead has two treasures: an <strong>Axe&#39;s Orb</strong>, and a <strong>Whip&#39;s Orb</strong>! They&#39;re also monsters-in-a-box, as Armored Men pop out after we open the chests!</p>
<p>If these are the best soldiers the Empire has to offer...</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Inside the main hall, we have more enemies to take care of!</p>
<p>A <strong>Dark Ninja</strong> in red&#39;s here too, hmm?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/G6o5HdR.png alt="dark ninja" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We go up to the western staircase this time...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/iDhIHqM.png alt="double doors" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>These doors must go to the Emperor&#39;s throne.</p>
<p>I turn back to the empty dining hall to recover, and check if there&#39;s anything I missed...nothing here.</p>
<p>Beyond the double doors...</p>
<p>We&#39;re now in an assembly or council hall of sorts, where two Dark Ninjas are holding up mirrors to hide themselves!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/OEHWcgf.png alt="ninja assembly hall" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>After fighting the ninjas, I press the button to reveal a door forward!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/MuQH1Tr.png alt="assembly hall" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We avoid the ninja in the next room and go up the stairs.</p>
<p>So this is probably the living quarters we&#39;re in...</p>
<p>More Imperial tin men are around...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ZS2uf0d.png alt="imperial tin men" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>These guys are quick to dodge our attacks!</p>
<p>After speeding up Hero, Pidge is now leveled up to 2 in her earth magic!</p>
<p>Another set of guards to take care of, and another flight of stairs...</p>
<p><a name=6></a></p>
<hr>
<p>It seems we&#39;re back in the prison area of the castle...or not.</p>
<p>Hmmm, which warp point should we take?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/XfO7vMC.png alt="warp glyphs which one" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I have to choose carefully since one of them might lead us back...</p>
<p>I go to the warp glyph from the east hall, leading us to the west part of the room.</p>
<p>I circle around to the west warp glyph...</p>
<p>...which push us back!</p>
<p>After taking care of the ninja nearby, we cross forward and head into the double doors ahead (the warp glyph doesn&#39;t stop us this time, fsr)...</p>
<p>...and into the throne room!</p>
<p>The Emperor and his minions minus Thanatos are present.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/xMTG2W6.png alt="emperor surprise" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>After the faint praise, Geshtar begs the Emperor for one more chance to take care of us!</p>
<p><strong>Emperor:</strong> &quot;...Why not? Finish them up and come to the palaces.&quot;</p>
<p>Everyone vanishes, save for Geshtar.</p>
<p>I feel a boss fight coming...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/eX6agFz.png alt="now to reclaim my honor" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Geshtar, you have none!</p>
<p>And we get transported to the castle roof!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/H6WhyXW.png alt="castle roof" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Other than the beautiful view beyond, we&#39;re now stuck with...</p>
<p><a name=7></a></p>
<hr>
<p>...another knight in a motorbike!</p>
<p>He temporarily KO&#39;s Hero and Pidge as he rides off to the other side of the roof!</p>
<p>I have Pidge speed Hero up, and as soon as he gets the enchantment, the biker knocks him unconscious again!</p>
<p>The Mech Rider speeds himself up too!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/oj2RyhW.png alt="mech rider speed up" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The Gem Missile seems to work on him, though!</p>
<p>The battle continues as we go left-to-right on the roof!</p>
<p>I switch Hero to the whip since the bow and arrow don&#39;t seem to work.</p>
<p>After speeding up Hero, his attacks against the boss connect more!</p>
<p>I also have Max slow down the rider, though I&#39;m not sure that seemed to affect him...</p>
<p>The Mech Rider has new tricks in his arsenal as well: a <strong>Wave Cannon!</strong></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/rkQNQME.png alt="cornered mech rider" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We&#39;ve got him cornered for now...</p>
<p>He fires his second salvo, making its mark on Hero!</p>
<p>But after one Gem Missile, the fireworks show begins for the Mech Rider!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/UGE9j9l.png alt="fireworks mech rider 2" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We get a <strong>Javelin&#39;s Orb!</strong></p>
<p>But Geshtar, not happy that his second Mech Rider failed him, decides to destroy the castle!!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/CTFYp41.png alt="destroy castle" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Hero:</strong> &quot;We&#39;re finished!&quot;</p>

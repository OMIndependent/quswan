<p>The waterbed in town&#39;s still dried up...</p>
<p>The nobleman next to the king tells us that &quot;Mana is growing weaker.&quot; He tells us that in order to restore the water in town, we need a certain item.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ygG7d7h.png alt="sea hare tail" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>A Sea Hare’s Tail...hmmm...</p>
<p>The dancer in town&#39;s proposing to move to the Empire... <img class=emojione alt=☹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p><strong>Dancer:</strong> &quot;Now even Cannon Travel has a route there!&quot;</p>
<p>It seems I have six weapons to upgrade. But which one needs it?</p>
<p>I upgrade the <strong>Sprite&#39;s Spear</strong> and <strong>Stout Axe</strong>, which become the <strong>Partisan</strong> and <strong>Battle Axe</strong> respectively!</p>
<p>Now for the <strong>Long Bow</strong> and <strong>Light Trident</strong>, which become a <strong>Great Bow</strong> and a <strong>Lode Javelin</strong>!</p>
<p>Here&#39;s my weapon stats so far:</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/X4f22IZ.png alt="updated weapon stats" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>So the Partisan (which now looks like a light double-sided axe instead of a spear) is useful against slimes and lizards, the Battle Axe against plants and fish, the Great Bow causes confusion in enemies, and the Lode Javelin balloons them!</p>
<p>The Cannon Guy here now has three destinations for us to choose!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/sYRhHCh.png alt="three destinations" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The Empire!? Oh boy...</p>
<p>I head back to town to gather more info. The girl before the entrance tells us since she&#39;s friends with Salamando, and that we&#39;re friends with Salamando, it means she&#39;s our friend too!</p>
<p>It looks like we&#39;ll have to take a trip to the center of everything evil...</p>
<p>After buying an herb, we go to the Empire...</p>
<p>The Cannon Guy advises us to &quot;keep a low profile&quot; there. Since Thanatos might have told them about us, that&#39;s to be expected...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/DTEabvb.png alt="cannon fly" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We descend on the top of a mountain where a castle&#39;s perched...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>But we land on green grass near another Cannon Travel station!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/OVi6kWF.png alt="grassy station" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/GMJYMWad-LI>The music for the Empire&#39;s pretty happy-sounding</a>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> After looking at the online map, I realized we landed near the cannon station, not on a castle!</p>
<p>We talk to a guard, who tells us were in the Southtown of the Empire.</p>
<p>Someone tells us a woman named <strong>Mara</strong> lives in the suburb like house before us. He doesn&#39;t have anything good to say about her though...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/EqtZnJQ.png alt="mara box" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Is she like Reed from <strong>Dust</strong>?</p>
<p>The house we first see looks like something out of <strong>Earthbound</strong>, since it wouldn&#39;t be too out of place in that game.</p>
<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> I have not played <strong>Earthbound</strong>, though I&#39;ve seen some pictures of the game online, and used a tileset from that game for one of my small projects. I might play that someday.</p>
<p>Southtown looks so clean and green, though the place is walled up.</p>
<p>An elderly citizen gives us a glimpse about the mindset and politics of the Emperor.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/7Kl70Ji.png alt=emperor width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/LeKh4Hh.png alt="force of monsters" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Why does the Emperor have monsters when he wants peace though? Unless it&#39;s for not-so altruistic reasons...</p>
<p>As we wander to the east of town, a guy with a headband sees us and wanders off. I thought my controller stopped working at this point...</p>
<p>We catch up to the guy, now guarding a gate. He tells us to go away fsr.</p>
<p>Inside the two story house, there&#39;s another dancing innkeeper, and the room looks more like an infirmary than an inn.</p>
<p>I save here before going upstairs.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Upstairs, I check out the shopkeeper&#39;s wares: he has a <strong>Golem Ring</strong>, a <strong>Ruby Vest</strong>, and a <strong>Quilted Hood</strong> in addition to previous stuff.</p>
<p>I buy the three new pieces of equipment.</p>
<p>After making some equipment chgs and selling some, I head out. Northwest of town, there&#39;s an old woman who goes into the small house behind her...</p>
<p>Another lady near the wall tells us &quot;Southtown&#39;s not as big as Northtown.&quot;</p>
<p>I go in the small house where the elderly woman went into.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/mFcdQYx.png alt=mara width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We talk to the old woman. It&#39;s Mara!</p>
<p><strong>Mara:</strong> &quot;Ah! I know who you are!&quot;<br>
<strong>Hero:</strong> &quot;!?..&quot;</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/hXbQfAZ.png alt="jema's friends" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Whoa, what!?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mara:</strong> &quot;So was my husband till he got...caught. I&#39;m continuing his work. Enter Northtown from the Resistance&#39;s sewer-way, east of here. Give the guard this secret number: <strong>&#39;634.&#39;</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>We talk to the guy with the headband before the gate to the sewer...</p>
<p>He tells us to &quot;try the secret number!&quot;</p>
<p>We give the number to him.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/XZuqSZ7.png alt=enter width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We&#39;re in!</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Inside the sewers now, where Iffish swim about!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/sa14Vtj.png alt="sewer entrance" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Whoa, where&#39;s that small explosion coming from?!</p>
<p>It seems there&#39;s a new Iffishial breed of fish swimming about: a <strong>Dinofish!</strong></p>
<p>That Dinofish can shoot missiles!</p>
<p>And a Blue Drop, which splits into newer copies of itself to give us more trouble!</p>
<p>Outnumbered, we retreat downstairs, deeper into the sewers!</p>
<p>More monsters corner us, but we beat them back easy!</p>
<p>I have Pidge join in with her fire magic!</p>
<p>I have Hero and Max switch weapons to fight back the Blue Drops...</p>
<p>Analyzing the Dinofish, they&#39;re weak against fire magic! I have Pidge oblige with a Fire Bouquet!</p>
<p>We climb a staircase up...</p>
<p>After a long tussle, we head to the next staircase going up, where we&#39;re greeted by a group of rebels!</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Krissie</strong>, the leader, I&#39;m guessing, suspects we&#39;re Imperial spies!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/7RUl6Iq.png alt="imperial spies?" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>But she changes her tune after realizing the trio. Jema&#39;s spread word about us so quickly...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/bCvXSNj.png alt="welcome to the resistance" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><del>I still prefer a revolution group, though...</del></p>
<p>Hero nods and introduces himself.</p>
<p>Pidge is surprised and awed that the Resistance is led by a woman. She crosses her arms, looking away. She&#39;s in love with Krissie, or Hero, I&#39;m guessing...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/RhPM02b.png alt=woman width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Max:</strong> &quot;Jealous?&quot;<br>
<strong>Pidge:</strong> &quot;Knock it off! I&#39;m Dyluck&#39;s girl!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Krissie:</strong> &quot;You <strong>know</strong> Dyluck!?&quot;<br>
<strong>Pidge:</strong> &quot;Of course...why?&quot;</p>
<p>She tells us more news about Dyluck&#39;s whereabouts. He&#39;s up to no good. It&#39;s probably Thanatos who has him under his control...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Xd47d03.png alt="dyluck drain" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Pidge:</strong> &quot;Like in Pandora! But why&#39;s Dyluck...&quot;<br>
<strong>Krissie:</strong> &quot;Something must be controlling him. We&#39;ll check on that.&quot;</p>
<p>They wander about.</p>
<p><a name=6></a></p>
<hr>
<p>A Resistance man tells us that Krissie&#39;s father was the founder of this secret anti-Imperial group. So Krissie&#39;s been the rock of the Resistance, so to speak. And she&#39;s only 18...</p>
<p>We speak to the elderly man near the fireplace.</p>
<p>He tells us the trouble of the Empire started 15 years ago...</p>
<p>We head upstairs, where we talk to more people.</p>
<p>A mustached Resistance member tells us about the Emperor&#39;s very tough &quot;bodyguards.&quot; He lists them: <strong>Sheex</strong>, <strong>Geshtar</strong>, <strong>Fanha</strong>, and <strong>Thanatos</strong>. So far, we&#39;ve met two of these four Imperial &quot;bodyguards.&quot;</p>
<p>A little girl thinks &quot;it&#39;s fun playing war...&quot; <img class=emojione alt=☹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>A boy downstairs tells us he heard Krissie crying in her sleep. It&#39;s hard being the leader...</p>
<p>We&#39;re now in <strong>Northtown!</strong> What a bustling city!</p>
<p>Now where to find an inn to save at...?</p>
<p>Eventually we find the inn, and downstairs at the dining area, we see Watts!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/vzB1c9O.png alt="watts how did you get here?" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>But I head back up and rest and save here.</p>
<p>The inns in Southtown and Northtown are pretty pricey, 100 and 120 a night respectively!</p>

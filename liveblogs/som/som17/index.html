<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> I checked out the development of <strong>Secret of Mana</strong> on <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_of_Mana#Development>the wikipedia page</a>, and I found out that this game can be played with two players!</p>
<p>There’s now a tunnel that wasn&#39;t there before. I&#39;m guessing this is the way that leads to the Underground Palace.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/P2T6lfR.png alt="to underground palace" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Heading forward, we see a shiny thing on raised land.</p>
<p>We can&#39;t cross any further since there’s a river of lava here...</p>
<p>Max is getting pretty strong really fast. It&#39;s probably because of the monsters&#39; high XP in the caves here...</p>
<p>We take care of most of the monsters in a jiffy as we make our way back outside...</p>
<p>I decide to take to the eastern tunnel behind the falls.</p>
<p>There&#39;s Neko again! I decide to buy more stuff from him and save.</p>
<p>We climb down the long flight of stairs, only to have the party’s way blocked by stalagmites! Knowing that I saw a set of stairs blocked by stalagmites earlier, these stairs probably lead to Watts&#39; shop!</p>
<p>Back outside and to the woods we go!</p>
<p>But then, I suddenly realize that we forgot to get the axe from Watts! Ai yaaaaaa!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>On the way back underground, the Lullabud does its trademark sleeping spell for the first time on Hero!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/IT9GEyK.png alt="hero sleep" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>After tons of battling, though they were quick ones, we make it back to Watts, who tells us some bad news.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/0laurms.png alt="watts couldnt make axe" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Watts couldn&#39;t make the axe, but he notices Max’s boomerang, and asks Hero to hold the axe.</p>
<p>Another glowing light...the axe reacts to us!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/PLlhZSO.png alt="mana power" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> “This axe is mighty special! You could even smash a boulder with it!”</p>
<p>Wait, the stalagmites in the corner of his shop could be crumbled easily with the axe...</p>
<p>...but Watts asks for a fee of 100 before we could have it. We pay the fee.</p>
<p>Watts asks us to bring any weapons to him so he could forge them in order “to release any Mana received from the orbs.”</p>
<p>Watts then guides us to a shortcut, the one where the stalagmites are. He destroys them, clearing a path to the stairway! Thank you, Watts!</p>
<p>So Watts can upgrade our weapons if they&#39;re ready to be.</p>
<p>I have him upgrade the Spear, which becomes a <strong>Heavy Spear!</strong></p>
<p>We climb back up the stairs, meet the salescat, and save again.</p>

<hr>
<p>Back at the patch of flowers before the forest, the old man breathes a sigh of relief seeing Max safe.</p>
<p>Now to the portal...</p>
<p>The Chobin Hoods are a bit more tolerable to take on this time, but they can still hit heavy damage to my other allies if I&#39;m not careful.</p>
<p>Like at this moment, Pidge falls...</p>
<p>I resurrect her with another Cup of Wishes.</p>
<p>The Chobin Bow and Arrow’s are also ready to be upgraded! But I need to get an orb for it first...</p>
<p>We make our way to the tree roots, and chop them up easily with Watts’s Axe!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/2M0jZHt.png alt="logs chopped" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Now off to Elinee’s house...</p>
<p>We warp to the area where we formed the land bridge earlier, and climb down the stairs...</p>
<p>Inside a garden mini-maze now...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/CoKXIUm.png alt=post width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Climbing another set of stairs, we see a small wooden post. The other side probably leads back to the portal near the Water Temple...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ZXUirHu.png alt="steps to portal" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We enter into the next portal...I hope it leads to Elinee’s castle.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Instead, we continue down the cliff and into a more complex shrub maze...</p>
<p>After taking care of the last bat monster in the maze, we hurry off to the next portal. Let&#39;s hope this is the one leading to Elinee’s castle.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/B1U0NQY.png alt="next portal" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>As we make it to the outskirts of the castle wall, a <strong>werewolf</strong> lunges and gives Hero a one-two combination!</p>
<p>We take care of him, but because of my curiosity, we accidentally end up leaving the castle!</p>
<p>Going back, we get the drop on the werewolf this time, but he overpowers the party with his martial arts!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/59vOQDt.png alt="werewolf battle" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We check around the outer wall...</p>
<p>My god, Elinee was well prepared for our arrival, as she has Eye Spies on both corners inside the castle walls...</p>
<p>We take care of the eastern security, now for the western side...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/XXv9EyC.png alt="front door" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Hero gets turned into a moogle again, and dies!</p>
<p>I have Pidge revive him once more, and the security troops here are eventually taken care of!</p>
<p>We turn north and east and we make our way into the castle’s entrance!</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>After opening the portcullis by pressing on a button, the Eye Spy turns both Max and Hero into moogles!</p>
<p>I take control of Pidge and fire away at the Chobin Hoods and Eye Spy...</p>
<p>Sadly, the Chobin Hoods are still a bit formidable and I retreat as soon as the reaper takes both Pidge and Max!</p>
<p>As I flee the forest, I later revive Pidge, and on the way back, I learn a new trick from observing Hero’s allies: I can power-up the attack of the character I&#39;m controlling by holding the attack button!</p>
<p>Back at the Dwarf Village now, where I buy more supplies and a Chain Vest for Pidge for added protection.</p>
<p>This really isn&#39;t going to be easy...</p>
<p>For the questions I have now for this game so far:<br>
<strong>How did Elinee turn from good into evil?<br>
Is it because of the shift in Mana, or is it something else?<br>
Is Major Dyluck still alive?</strong></p>

<p>Elliott runs off, crying.</p>
<p>The knight confirms that we pulled out the real <strong>Mana Sword</strong>. Hero&#39;s a bit shocked by the news.</p>
<p>The knight explains further.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/UIfqEBB.png alt="mana sword pulled" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>But he calls Hero too young to wield it. What an ageist this guy is!</p>
<p>Hero offers him the Mana Sword.</p>
<p>The knight refuses to take the sword, saying it needs to be &quot;re-energized.&quot; He says the only person who pulled it from the rock is the one able to recharge it.</p>
<p>The knight tells us to visit <strong>Sage Luka</strong> in the <strong>Water Palace</strong>, knowing that she might have some tips on how to recharge the sword.</p>

<p>Timothy calls to hero that the Elder wants to see him! Oh dear...</p>
<p>The knight, <strong>Jema</strong>, tells Hero that he&#39;ll be waiting in the Water Palace.</p>
<p>I&#39;m now free to move.</p>
<p>I navigate the menu a bit more, and get some more stuff from the shop (but can&#39;t), and save before visiting the Elder.</p>

<hr>
<p>Inside the Elder&#39;s house, more villagers send their complaints about the monster attacks...</p>
<p>After noticing us, the Elder brings up the monster attacks, all caused by the Hero pulling out the sword!</p>

<p>Since he carries the Sword, which attracts the monsters, the villagers make their decision: <strong>to banish Hero.</strong> <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>The Elder makes his final decision as well, <a href=https://youtu.be/E7iC5NqmLYo>with sadness</a>, and formally banishes him from the village. As a parting gift, he tells us to take whatever&#39;s in the chest downstairs.</p>
<p>A kid downstairs gives us farewells too...</p>
<p>It&#39;s only 50 gold pieces inside...</p>

<p>So the Hero was adopted by the Elder, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Elder:</strong> &quot;Please forgive me. I know I&#39;ve told you this before, but...your mother broguht you to this village when you were just a baby. Soon afterwards, she disappeared...I took you and have done my best to raise you. But now we must part.&quot;</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/RpV8pmP.png alt="find your mother" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Elder:</strong> &quot;<strong>I truly hope you can find your mother someday...Good bye, Hero.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>No farewells...from anyone else...</p>
<p>The shopkeeper&#39;s only selling Hero stuff because the Elder ordered him to...</p>
<p>I&#39;m betting the gatekeeper&#39;s wanting for us to leave asap too...</p>
<p>I save and stop my session here.</p>
<p>Well, that escalated quickly! The main character&#39;s banished from his village in the first moments of the game! Comparing this game to <strong>Alundra</strong>, the citizens of Inoa are way more friendlier than the ones in this village.</p>

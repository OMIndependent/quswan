<p>The guard wandering by the gates welcomes us, and tells Hero that he has orders to let Hero pass into the town. Thank you, Jema.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/5tgaKmw.png alt="knight entrance" width=360 height=270></p>
<p>The guard calls Jema by his title: <strong>Sir Jema of Tasnica</strong>, and says he&#39;s with the King. He also advises Hero not to talk to anyone in town. But why?</p>
<p>I head to the nearby inn. The dancing innkeeper says Hero can help himself to a bed, but before Hero could run there, he stops him and asks for 10 gold. I like that little detail. </p>
<p>After saving, I check out the wares in the item shop. The shopkeeper says he doesn&#39;t have that much.</p>
<p>A <strong>Kung Fu Suit</strong>, and a <strong>Hair Ribbon</strong> are the new things.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I can&#39;t wear the Kung Fu Suit...</p>
<p>I also check up on the weapon stats and Hero&#39;s stats.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/8ctJ2xh.png alt="stats so far" width=360 height=270></p>
<p>Hmmm, I wonder what the blue orb means? Is it the power from the Mana Seed that we retrieved from the Water Palace?</p>
<p>I go into a house, where a middle-aged man and grandmother live. Grandma won&#39;t say a word.</p>
<p>Upstairs, the blue-haired daughter mentions something occurring in the ruins south of town. She mentions her grandma goes there...</p>
<p>In another house south of the one we exited, a maid tells us that her master and his daughter are prepping for an arranged marriage. Hmmm....</p>
<p>I accidentally run to the west bridge, which is the exit to somewhere.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>A blond mustached man asks why we&#39;re talking to him. It feels like he&#39;s hiding something for some reason.</p>
<p>He has a well-stocked kitchen, though.</p>
<p>Most of the townsfolk in Pandora are...a pretty quiet bunch.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/2p6dnbx.png alt="pretty quiet bunch" width=360 height=270></p>
<p>North of the bridge here and the gate beyond lies Pandora&#39;s castle.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/7wAnxz0.png alt="pandora gate" width=360 height=270></p>
<p>There&#39;s an armor shop south of the gates, but the shopkeeper&#39;s also quiet too...</p>
<p>In the house south of the armor shop, the children asks for Hero&#39;s help, worried about their parents. The parents are not talking either. What&#39;s going on?</p>
<p>Only the elderly woman near the gate to the castle can talk, and says that it&#39;s like everyone&#39;s &quot;lost their will to live!&quot;</p>
<p>I now have Hero head north to the castle.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/NqIy35J.png alt="castle entrance" width=360 height=270></p>
<p>At the main gates now...</p>
<p>I have Hero check around the walls of the castle. No guards patrolling.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>At the front door, we enter inside and check around for more info. There&#39;s one child who wonders when Major Dyluck will return, another person who asks us if we&#39;ve seen the <strong>Mana Tree</strong>, and another who mentions that the Empire attacked Pandora 15 years ago...</p>
<p>The maid mentions people wearing strange masks in the ruins south of the kingdom...</p>
<p>I can also push people around in this game.</p>
<p>One guard thinks the townspeople acting quiet is a result of the witch north of the kingdom. Maybe that&#39;s why Major Dyluck left the kingdom to head north, to take care of the witch there...</p>
<p>One man says that the witch has cursed the land...</p>
<p>A girl notes there&#39;s evil in the southern ruins. So it might not have been just the witch, or the town&#39;s quietness might not have been the witch&#39;s doing after all?</p>
<p>Sir Elman, a local knight, has set up an arranged marriage for his daughter.</p>
<p>Upstairs, we meet the girl who rescued us from the goblins!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/xffCkFS.png alt="girl again" width=360 height=270></p>
<p>So she&#39;s the daughter who&#39;s about to get married against her will...</p>
<p>She notices Hero&#39;s sword, and asks if he&#39;s a swordsman.</p>
<p>She asks him for a favor to pay back her rescuing him.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/sKy9Cnu.png alt=favor width=360 height=270></p>
<p>We&#39;re going to save Major Dyluck and his soldiers from the witch!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/3zdwMv5.png alt="save major" width=360 height=270></p>
<p>Whoa, that was a sudden turn of events!</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Hero and the girl introduce themselves.</p>
<p>And now I&#39;m asked to &quot;please name this young lady.&quot;</p>
<p>Hmmm...she almost reminds me of Marle from <strong>Chrono Trigger</strong>...</p>
<p>What name shall I give her? Maybe something simple, hmmm...</p>
<p>I call her <strong>Red</strong>. Or maybe, <strong>Pidge</strong>.</p>
<p>And Pidge joins the party!</p>
<p>I check her stats.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/rUKBibB.png alt="girl stats" width=360 height=270></p>
<p>Turns out Pidge is wearing a Kung Fu Suit as her main equipment, and has <strong>Spike Knuckles</strong> as her weapon.</p>
<p>I explore more of the castle before heading through the double doors, where the King of Pandora and Sir Jema are.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/nVUwmy2.png alt="sir jema" width=360 height=270></p>
<p>Most of the townspeople have gone quiet. But why?</p>
<p>He mentions that the witch <strong>Elinee</strong> north of Pandora is sapping people&#39;s energy away, and they&#39;re heading to the ruins in the south for some reason.</p>
<p>He instructs us to go to Gaia&#39;s Navel before making his leave.</p>
<p>The throne guards tell us that we can&#39;t enter, (we can&#39;t enter where, though?) and that Tasnica is an ally of Pandora.</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We speak to the Queen, who advises Hero to leave the country after she notes that he was banished from his village.</p>
<p>The Chancellor isn&#39;t too happy about the state of affairs in the country.</p>
<p>The King&#39;s in distress, he points out all of the problems in Pandora, where he points out that Elinee has turned everyone in his kingdom &quot;into zombies,&quot; with his best major captured.</p>
<p>Pidge calls out the King in spectacular fashion.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/EPc0WjA.png alt="you made dyluck go" width=360 height=270></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/OvfB9sa.png alt="drive me apart" width=360 height=270></p>
<p>So is this line implying she has some sort of relationship with Major Dyluck?</p>
<p>The soldiers call her out on her rudeness. We leave.</p>
<p>We explore the king&#39;s room, where there&#39;s a stairway leading to a treasure house meant for supplying the &quot;knight in the legend.&quot;</p>
<p>So I use the X and Y buttons, or triangle and square, to switch between Hero and Pidge...</p>
<p>I go into the room where Pidge&#39;s father, Sir Elman, is supposed to be. No one&#39;s there. He must have left...</p>
<p>At the item shop now, selling the extra Kung Fu Suit and buying more Candy, but I&#39;m not able to since I can only carry up to 4 pieces at a time!</p>
<p>I have the party rest up...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/VAgmfts.png alt=resting width=360 height=270></p>
<p>...and save, stopping my session here for tonight!</p>

<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>Now we are transported before the Emperor, where Fanha notices us! In place of Sheex is an Imperial soldier!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/oelayY9.png alt="fanha prepare to" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The Emperor tells Fanha to drop it for now, and starts to prepare for the Mana Fortress!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/tFeNq8E.png alt="fanha vow" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Fanha vows to take us down before leaving...</p>
<p>A bright golden light shines...</p>
<p>...and we proceed up the stairs...</p>
<p>Into a hall with more monsters to block our progress!</p>
<p>We turn on the tables on the Metal Crawlers with Hero&#39;s fire imbued weapon!</p>
<p>Down more stairs...</p>
<p>The area here looks more like Catapult or Ronka Ruins...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/gOCzhH1.png alt="metal crawler" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Plenty of monsters and ancient machinery down here...</p>
<p>We escape the two Capt. Ducks into an ancient conveyor belt...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/e9FEkJk.png alt="conveyor belt" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>After taking care of two more Fierce Heads, we encounter another barrier...</p>
<p>It seems that we need to press a switch to proceed, and it&#39;s somewhere near the west conveyor belt...</p>
<p>There it is!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/vrOizOT.png alt="switch escalator" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>So the Kimono Wizard, I learn, spawns those dang Metal Crawlers!</p>
<p>Now we escape east, and after taking care of two Steelpions with Max&#39;s wind magic, we go inside the room...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Watts! How does this blacksmith keep finding us?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/5ySPy4N.png alt="watts is here" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I upgrade the weapons we&#39;ve received orbs from earlier: the Whip and Boomerang...</p>
<p><strong>Morning Star</strong> to <strong>Hammer Flail</strong><br>
<strong>Cobra Shuttle</strong> to <strong>Frizbar</strong></p>
<p>The Hammer Flail slows enemies, while the Frizbar&#39;s good against slimes and lizards...</p>
<p>There&#39;s Krissie and a Republic soldier here too!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/VnU3Ubo.png alt="krissie and soldier" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Krissie recovers our health!</p>
<p>We talk to the guard, who gives us important code he overheard from Imperial soldiers.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/EXLUSEb.png alt=rbgy width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Guard:</strong> &quot;&#39;Red-Blue-Yellow-Green.&#39;&quot;</p>
<p>...I&#39;ll have to remember this, it might be a passcode to open a door in the city...</p>
<p>We head east of the hall, and make it to more chambers, where more Capt. Ducks await!</p>
<p>Westward, we get into another room with a set of conveyor belts.</p>
<p>Climbing that, more Imperial troops, and remnants from Thanatos&#39;s forces, await!</p>
<p>We jump down a ledge, and face off against more monsters and a stubborn Capt. Duck!</p>
<p>More endless monsters later, we come across a room with four transparent tiles in the middle, with the north one pushing us down, and a barrier to the west.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/5tLE9L8.png alt="four tiles" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>For some reason, stepping on the center tile lowered the barrier. There must be an invisible switch here...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Next room, we seem to be at a pool of sorts...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/E5ygL4h.png alt=pool width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Ahead, more monsters like the Shape Shifter await!</p>
<p>I switch Hero to the whip...</p>
<p>A hall of these gray blobs meet us!</p>
<p>I switch Hero&#39;s weapon again to the Boomerang...</p>
<p>Half of the Shape Shifters transform once again. I decide to slow them down, which actually works!</p>
<p>I use the whip and Speed Down combo to slow the Capt. Ducks down...</p>
<p>Looks like a Dark Stalker&#39;s in the building as well!</p>
<p>No, two of them!</p>
<p>We take care of them, and see four consoles with color-coded buttons in the center...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/EWSdEWZ.png alt="four buttons" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The Republic soldier tolds us the code to open this barrier is <strong>red</strong>, <strong>blue</strong>, <strong>yellow</strong>, and <strong>green</strong>...</p>
<p>I switch Hero to the fist to activate the switches.</p>
<p>That did the trick!</p>
<p>Instead of going down there, I head west down some more stairs to face against more Metal Crawlers...</p>
<p>After a whole runaround and another recovery from Krissie, we make our laborious, monster-filled trek back to the consoles, where the Dark Stalkers there give Max a two-hit death blow!</p>
<p>I take this chance to perform Pidge&#39;s Revivifier spell, resurrecting Max!</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>In the next room, we&#39;re surrounded by Kimono Wizards!</p>
<p>While I have Max spam wind magic, I hit the switch near here, lowering more barriers!</p>
<p>Max&#39;s wind magic&#39;s now at level 6, and the Air Blasts are now mini-vortexes...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/7grem8T.png alt=mini-vortexes width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We climb down the long staircases...</p>
<p>...where a small wave of two troops await us! Taking care of them, and crossing into another long conveyor belt..,</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/xMJfBWB.png alt="long conveyor belt" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>It&#39;s a never ending parade of Imperial forces here. Seems like The Emperor&#39;s not making this easy...I&#39;m remembering a note I made back at the Imperial castle, saying &quot;If this is the best the Empire has to offer...&quot; I take it back. This is mostly the Empire&#39;s elite we&#39;re facing at this point...</p>
<p>There&#39;s a hall of turnstiles before us next, and a Capt. Duck!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/b6fOtyC.png alt="subway turnstile" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Ahead, we see a subway train!</p>
<p>My guess of this game being set in a post-apocalyptic world is right on here!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/eMhRWZr.png alt="subway train" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Now boarding...</p>
<p>...where tons of Ghouls are seated in the passenger cars!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/E9EdJWD.png alt="ghouls on train" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We press on, fighting more Ghouls! At least they&#39;re easy compared to the other monsters inside the city...</p>
<p>At the end of the car is an Eggplant Man...and Needlions!</p>
<p>One Needlion takes out Pidge!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/UfO3q99.png alt="end of car" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>After they&#39;re gone, I revive Pidge and debark the train...</p>
<p>At the other end of the station, a determined troop of Shape Shifters and Captain Ducks are our greeting party!</p>
<p>I press another switch in the east booth, lowering the barrier here!</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Oh my god, there&#39;s <strong>more</strong> passages!?</p>
<p>And the Dark Stalker here KOs two-thirds of the party with his endless Shurikens!!!</p>
<p>I revive Hero as a last resort!</p>
<p>Knowing we can&#39;t fight him in our condition, we escape into a spare room...</p>
<p>...where the Scorpion Army awaits us!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/jY7ahdj.png alt="hey you" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Looks like the boss knows who Hero is now!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/MYOBkU4.png alt="legendary knight" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/D2Hq095.png alt="hand over blade" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I have no time to face you guys...</p>
<p>One of the minions in green mentions how much riches they&#39;re going to receive once they take the Mana Sword from Hero!</p>
<p>The boss tells him to grab the sword! But, the boss decides to take it by another way...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/CI2jafz.png alt="turbo robot!!" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Another robot?!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kettle Kin</strong>&#39;s their new robot?</p>
<p>Into another boss battle we go!</p>
<p><a name=6></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I revive Pidge, and analyze this robot. He has no weaknesses...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/laUPGRe.png alt="kettle kin" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The robot casts a Lucid Barrier, and taking advice from the online guide, I spam him full of Air Blasts!</p>
<p>Since the robot keeps playing the Lucid Barrier game, I have Pidge cast Lucid Barriers as well.</p>
<p>The Air Blasts seem to lose their power...</p>
<p>The Thunderbolt spell&#39;s more effective against the robot!</p>
<p>Second Thunderbolt! Now take that!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/vIfl0Oo.png alt="kettle kin done" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I get a <strong>Bow&#39;s Orb</strong> as my prize.</p>
<p>Fearful of the Mana Knight in charge, the Scorpion Army flees!</p>
<p>We&#39;re now back at the surface!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/sxYo9um.png alt="up to surface" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Inside the Tree Palace&#39;s doors we go...</p>
<p>...where a <strong>Heck Hound</strong>, or a Hellhound, awaits!</p>
<p>Tired, I decide to go back out, summon Flammie, and recover our wounds...</p>

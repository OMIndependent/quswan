<p>We pass through the Haunted Forest in order to return to Pandora and to the southern ruins.</p>
<p>At the grassy meadow on the way, I have a demo at using the Pole Dart, which is a Javelin by any other name...</p>
<p>The Pole Dart&#39;s surprisingly accurate!</p>
<p>Before going to the ruins, we talk to a blue haired woman named <strong>Phanna</strong>. Pidge seems to know her...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/uVw740J.png alt="phanna silent" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>It&#39;s no use. No one can talk here.</p>
<p>Heading to the rich-looking house, or Pidge&#39;s place...</p>
<p>Sir Elman is surprised to see her with the party here.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/dIuSDeY.png alt="sir elman shock" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>She vows that she will not come back until Major Dyluck is rescued!</p>
<p>We head north to the Cannon Brother and travel to Gaia&#39;s Navel straight away!</p>
<p>Landing at Gaia&#39;s Navel, we end up hitting a Buzz Bee!</p>
<p>We go down to see Watts again to upgrade our weapons...now, let&#39;s see which weapon do I want to upgrade?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/8HbVrq2.png alt="ready for upgrade" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The Boomerang and the glove weapon, the Spike Knuckle, are ready for upgrades. I upgrade the Boomerang.</p>
<p>After giving Watts 200, he reforges the Boomerang into <a href=http://aselia.wikia.com/wiki/Colette_Brunel>Colette</a>&#39;s trademark weapon, the <strong>Chakram!</strong></p>

<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Now that we have everything, we head into the tunnel!</p>
<p>The shining metal ball, which is a crystal orb, in the middle might activate if we hit it with something...</p>
<p>I have Max Freeze the crystal orb.</p>
<p>That did the trick! The lava&#39;s gone!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/DMmGGG3.png alt="lava vanish" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We&#39;re now in the Underground Ruins proper, where two <strong>Goblins</strong> and a <strong>Ma Goblin</strong> greet us!</p>
<p>Even Goblins can heal too, huh?</p>
<p>But the Goblins&#39; boomerangs and Ma Goblin&#39;s axe overpower us again, forcing us back. Pidge is taken out of the action as well...</p>
<p>After the Goblins get taken care of, their Ma Goblins take over fighting for them, I think.</p>
<p>I heal everyone and revive Pidge before moving forward.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The <strong>Underground Palace</strong> looks intricate and chapel-like. <a href=https://youtu.be/HaWz3AL8mWw>The palace&#39;s music is a bit hard to describe. It sounds...serious.</a></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/DjLqwmN.png alt="underground palace ent" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We open the door and cross forward, only for a stray boomerang to hit Hero square in the face!</p>
<p>So the Ma Goblins spawn from the Goblin...</p>
<p>The middle staircase is blocked by a huge torch!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/bUru0Av.png alt="huge torch" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We open the door to the east corridor, where we get a Green Drop Surprise!</p>
<p>We press on forward to the end of the room, where a switchpad lies.</p>
<p>I wonder what pressing it does?</p>
<p>We head for the western door, and press the switchpad there. The torch is now gone!</p>
<p>Climbing the stairs, we&#39;re greeted by another puzzle!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/eRFHGpc.png alt="bridge switchpad" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Pressing the left switchpad, a bridge is revealed!</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The next roomâ€™s flooring looks different, and more Goblins come forth!</p>
<p>Ma Goblin also has another magic spell up her sleeve, <strong>Defender</strong>, boosting her defenses!</p>
<p>Near wounded again...these Goblins are tough!</p>
<p>Max falls to the reaper, but I revive him.</p>
<p>Exiting the hall into another corridor, where more Goblins ambush us!</p>
<p>Thinking there&#39;s a post nearby, I have Hero equip the Whip. But, I don&#39;t see any post on the other side...</p>
<p>In the middle of the gap is a small flame. I think I have to extinguish the flame before crossing to the other side...</p>
<p>Or not, as I try another tactic. I head back to the bridge and press on the north switchpad, taking out the bridge.</p>
<p>Returning, a ledge with a pole&#39;s now visible!</p>
<p>On the other side, more Goblins ambush us, and their endless attacks prevent us from making any move!</p>
<p>And we&#39;re finished!</p>
<p>I go through everything that I did earlier all over again, except for entering the palace proper. This time, after sinking the lava, I head back to the village inn to rest up and save.</p>

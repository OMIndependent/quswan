<p>I land at Max&#39;s village and go to the Wind Shrine first...</p>
<p>Checking Dryad&#39;s magic, she has two spells for Max: <strong>Sleep Flower</strong>, and <strong>Burst</strong>. For Pidge, she has <strong>Revivifier</strong> and <strong>Wall (or Reflect)!</strong></p>

<p>I check on the Wind Palace&#39;s dais, where the seed&#39;s placed. The power of the seed&#39;s gone!</p>
<p>I ask Max&#39;s Grandpa to heal us and save before heading to the Water Palace. Maybe Luka might know something to restore them...</p>
<p>Where did Luka go?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/xDNf9sq.png alt="water palace seed" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I head to the dais to try our luck in restoring the seal to the Seed here.</p>
<p>No good.</p>
<p>We head down to the lower quarters in the shrine...</p>
<p>There&#39;s Luka!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/fHX1So9.png alt="luka locked 1" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Understatement of the year...</p>
<p><strong>Luka:</strong> &quot;Some Imperial thugs came, locked me up, and broke the seed&#39;s seal.&quot;</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/MTcVMV7.png alt="luka locked 2" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>But how do we restore the seals?</p>
<p><strong>Luka:</strong> &quot;Nothing else for me to do. I&#39;m just hoping for a miracle!&quot;</p>
<p>I speak to her again, she tells us to &quot;never give up hope!&quot; This is getting a bit hopeless...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We land back at the risen continent, near the Tree Palace, where I see Jema, and two <strong>Dark Knight</strong>s flanking the entrance to the Tree Palace...</p>
<p>They buff themselves with Wall spells, and we speak to Jema.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/AZy0fp3.png alt="jema continent" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Jema:</strong> &quot;I&#39;ve brought troops here to keep the Empire from taking the Mana Fortress. There&#39;s an ancient city under this Grand Palace. We must get into it!&quot;</p>
<p>Jema gives us more revelations about Emperor Vandole, and why he wants war.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/DrlWvpn.png alt="emperor w underworld" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Jema:</strong> &quot;Though your sword isn&#39;t fully powered, you need it to stop the Emperor! We&#39;ll fight off the Imperial troops here. You catch up with those soldiers!&quot;</p>
<p>We head inside the Tree Palace, where the way forward is gone!</p>
<p>No choice but to go down the steps...</p>
<p>It seems our old mini-nemesis, the Shape Shifter, is here too...</p>
<p>On the way, we meet a Republic soldier...</p>
<p>A <strong>Metal Crawler</strong>&#39;s here too...</p>
<p>More steps to climb down...</p>
<p>The Metal Crawlers can also cast Reflect!</p>
<p>I try a different strategy...I have Pidge buff Max with Reflect...</p>
<p>We make it to the ground floor and into a shallow river, finding another entrance here!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/31sMf2b.png alt="river maze" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Now how to get out of this river maze...</p>
<p>But I&#39;ll have to think about that later, as I quick save here for now.</p>
<p>Now I&#39;m back, it&#39;s time to find a way to get into that door!</p>
<p>The monsters we&#39;re trying to attack are on land, while we&#39;re in a shallow river...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We head down the staircase, and into a sand covered ruin...</p>
<p>The new monster here is a <strong>Steelpion!</strong></p>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/rauabAi55dI>The remix for &quot;Into the Thick of It&quot; is back!</a></p>
<p>After taking care of the Steelpion, we&#39;re now a bit stuck...</p>
<p>It turns I have to use the axe to clear these small blue and purple weeds out of the way...</p>
<p>I use the little yellow guy to jump up and reach the chest on the higher ledge there.</p>
<p>But after a little slip on the waterfall, we manage to get it!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/nbFZMSe.png alt="boomerang orb get" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Into the door, where there&#39;s more of these weeds! What are they, actually?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/e4GcDfO.png alt="coral maze?" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>There&#39;s also a switch that restores them!</p>
<p>Up north, we see more Metal Crawlers!</p>
<p>Those crawlers can breathe fire too, huh?</p>
<p>Ahead, we see another newcomer, a <strong>Kimono Wizard!</strong> Like his cousin in the Dragon Caves, he doesn&#39;t like earth magic!</p>
<p>Further on in the coral covered ruin, we see a <strong>Basilisk!</strong></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/2gLkk9S.png alt="basilisk eyes" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Those eyes make the Basilisk cute and creepy at the same time!</p>
<p>Most of these monsters here are weak against wind magic...</p>
<p>The Basilisk can lay eggs, hatching Eggatrices...</p>
<p>After a near-KO match, we proceed, and get caught up in a strong waterfall, which almost tosses us into the pit below!</p>
<p>So that waterfall just led us back near the entrance...</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Now how do we switch off these waterfalls?</p>
<p>After seeing a glowing red switch, I press it, and that seemed to do the trick!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/9yOs3X8.png alt="waterfall switch" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We now move back up and cross into the next passage...</p>
<p>...but another waterfall pushes us back down! The switch to shut that off is east this time!</p>
<p>After two or three attempts, I finally shut off that waterfall!</p>
<p>Now we face off against another boss! Whoop-de-doo...as if those monsters back there weren&#39;t enough...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/G39k2eG.png alt="hydra boss" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>It&#39;s a <strong>Hydra</strong> this time!</p>
<p>Analyzing this boss, he&#39;s weak against fire!</p>
<p>I have Pidge imbue Hero&#39;s axe with fire, and spam fire on him!</p>
<p>Those heads could knock the party unconscious if I&#39;m not careful!</p>
<p>And just like in the old Grecian tales, the Hydra can regenerate his heads!</p>
<p>He proceeds to Acid Storm us twice!</p>
<p>My god, this Hydra&#39;s range is very long!!</p>
<p>A few fire spells later, and we see the fireworks!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/cQ01IP6.png alt="hydra fireworks" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We earn another orb, I&#39;m guessing...a <strong>Whip&#39;s Orb!</strong></p>

<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>I&#39;m now alone with Hero again...</p>
<p>I introduce myself to the blond tough guy, who&#39;s a pirate! He introduces himself as <strong>Sergo</strong>.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/DcR8mr8.png alt="sergo the pirate" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Sergo:</strong> &quot;At least I used to be... the oceans have grown too stormy...I stowed away cause I missed my ship so much. Wonder if the oceans will ever be safe again?&quot;</p>
<p>Another man points out that anyone picked up in the desert are slaves to the ship and its crew...</p>
<p>I get more info from the soldiers guarding the place concering two new names: <strong>Admiral Meria</strong> and his grandson, <strong>Commander Morie</strong>.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/suQtEGR.png alt="meria morie" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The soldier tells us that Morie would&#39;ve left people in the desert if he had it his way...</p>
<p>From another soldier, I&#39;m told that I&#39;m in a &quot;secret sandship&quot; owned by the <strong>Republic.</strong></p>
<p>So there&#39;s a Republic in this game. Aren&#39;t they supposed to be helping us if they&#39;re the Republic?</p>
<p>And I&#39;m also stuck here, huh?</p>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/oj7oPdMVChw>Here&#39;s the theme for the Sandship.</a></p>
<p>Nowhere to run to, no secret passages here...</p>
<p>I talk to Sergo again for any escape plans. I&#39;m told to talk to those guards near the stairs, and tells me to leave it to him.</p>
<p>Sergo calls out a false alarm in the engines!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Now&#39;s our chance!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/dtxRh7I.png alt=outside width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Outside, the Sandship&#39;s moving...</p>
<p>I head up and into the second deck...</p>
<p>Inside a room, the mess hall, I see Max, an old man (who&#39;s the chef), and a guard, who tells Max to stop messing around.</p>
<p>The sprite&#39;s being worked, or not!</p>
<p><strong>Max:</strong> &quot;Just like paradise in here, eh, buddy?&quot;</p>
<p>Max ate the entire food supply of the sandship!</p>
<p>The old chef hands him over to us!</p>
<p>Max is still full from the meals he ate...hee...</p>
<p>Now for Pidge. Where is she?</p>
<p>I&#39;m stuck again!</p>
<p>But I head down another set of stairs, where I see more Republic guards on duty!</p>
<p>I can&#39;t leave the ship...</p>
<p>What an amazing view from the bow!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/0uTY3Qj.png alt="amazing view" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Now let&#39;s find where Pidge is...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>It takes me awhile before I realize that there&#39;s a door on the exterior of the ship...ai ya! It&#39;s hard to find...</p>
<p>I climb the west staircase to talk to the helmsman.</p>
<p>He asks us if we want to &quot;make a log entry,&quot; or to save here. I do so.</p>
<p>We head down to confront the Commander.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/rIpkxOf.png alt="before two guards" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Max yells that the rats have eaten the food supply! The guards walk away. Max laughs.</p>
<p>We proceed into the doorway, where Cmdr. Morie and Pidge are. It&#39;s not a very good meeting...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/7ocTLde.png alt="massage my back" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Pidge gets an adultist insult for refusing to massage Morie, and before she could slug him, Adm. Meria enters the office!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/957ljSf.png alt="enter adm meria" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Meria tells Pidge to get out of the office. Pidge harrumphs.</p>
<p><strong>Pidge:</strong> &quot;Jerks...&quot;</p>
<p>She&#39;s happy to see all of us, and the gang&#39;s back together again!</p>
<p>Morie blames his grandpa admiral for letting the party get away! Meria comes to his senses and has the guards throw us in the brig!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/9HjX1BC.png alt="about to be captured" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>But a whole lotta shaking and rumbling&#39;s going on!</p>
<p>The Empire has come! Morie pathetically suggests surrender.</p>
<p>Meria wants to fight! But the soldiers are still commanded by Morie and give in!</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>And the Imperials have now taken control of the sandship, with Geshtar leading the pack!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/u8uu8HG.png alt="empire takeover sandship" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The Empire&#39;s reach is vast indeed!</p>
<p>We try escaping, but no good, the ship&#39;s still moving...we talk to Geshtar at the bow!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ckIIXQB.png alt="geshtar didn't expect" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Didn&#39;t expect the Empire in the desert either, unless they&#39;re looking for the Fire Palace!</p>
<p>It seems Thanatos has told Geshtar about us!</p>
<p>Geshtar offers to play a &quot;game&quot; with us...</p>
<p>He dumps us all in the desert, where we&#39;re faced with another boss!</p>
<p><strong>Geshtar:</strong> &quot;So long, chumps!&quot;</p>
<p>The Imperial scumbag leaves us to battle with a <strong>Mech Rider</strong>, or a knight in a steel horse!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/oM55xAN.png alt="mech rider" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I have Max throw some ice on the rider! It seems to work...</p>
<p>While scanning the Mech Rider, he boosts his speed stats up, and leaves us with dust!</p>
<p>Chasing after him, he throws <strong>missiles</strong> at us!</p>
<p>I have Pidge heal us, and boost Hero&#39;s speed stats to keep up with the boss!</p>
<p>It&#39;s now a chase in the desert, where I have Hero hit him with the Claymore and various spells from Max...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/VOzRvK0.png alt="mech rider finished" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>After a while, the rider and his ride go down!</p>
<p>We get a <strong>Whip&#39;s Orb!</strong></p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The entire Republic&#39;s now stranded in the desert!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/lzbDEkP.png alt="stranded republic" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Sergo offers his services in any case we need him again...</p>
<p>From a soldier, to go to the <strong>Kingdom of Kakkara</strong>, all we need to do is head north, or to go west if we want reach the Fire Palace.</p>
<p>Morie&#39;s mourning over the loss of his sandship, while Meria&#39;s just saying &quot;shameful...&quot;</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/wZkWtwp.png alt="talking to meria" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Meria:</strong> &quot;What a mess...everyone&#39;s run away!&quot;</p>
<p>The admiral&#39;s in shock that we know Jema, and apologizes for what his grandson, Cmdr. Morie, did to us.</p>
<p><strong>Meria:</strong> &quot;I had almost forgotten how true soldiers act!&quot;</p>
<p>We tell one of the soldiers that we&#39;re leaving, and we end up around a batch of quicksand pits...or rather, we&#39;re standing on one!</p>
<p>I wonder if we&#39;ll see the Republic again?</p>
<p>After taking care of one monster here, we head north, like the soldier said, into town.</p>

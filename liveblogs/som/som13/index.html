<p>Now we take the long way westward and northward to the Haunted Forest!</p>
<p>More rounds of battles here, and these monsters are relentless!</p>
<p>I also get my first taste of a chest trap in the form of poison needles! Eeeee...</p>
<p>The Mushboom can also do a rolling attack!</p>
<p>After those exhausting battles, I make a stopover at Kippo Village to rest there for a bit, and to restock on my antidotes.</p>
<p>Kippo Village is pretty friendly enough...</p>
<p>An <strong>Elbow Pad</strong> catches my eye while shopping for supplies, so I get it for Hero!</p>
<p>I just realized now that Pidge has MP!</p>
<p>I speak to the old man at the bed of flowers, who mentions that there are plenty of enemies in Gaia&#39;s Navel.</p>
<p>Alright, we&#39;re now back in the Haunted Forest!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/57oQYN8.png alt="chobin hood" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The Chobin Hood&#39;s a tough opponent to take care of!</p>
<p>And there&#39;s a fleet of them, mostly hiding behind thornbushes and rosebushes!</p>
<p>I find some roses to cut through around their thornbush forts just to take care of them...</p>
<p>Hero&#39;s getting seriously injured!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/VobOq6z.png alt="hero hurt" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I accidentally find the option to switch control to Pidge, by pressing Select!</p>
<p>I regain control back to Hero, and finish off the surprisingly tough Chobin Hoods.</p>
<p>There&#39;s also a familiar face as well: Neko!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/HVkSDdY.png alt="neko in forest" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We talk to Neko again. Not only does he have wares to sell us, he can save our game too!</p>
<p>I save at this point before climbing up the stairs and taking care of more Chobin Hoods...</p>
<p>And the ones we finished off earlier have respawned again!</p>
<p>After a bit of a struggle, leaving Hero almost finished, we head into the portal!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/dIBdA14.png alt="next part of forest" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Now which part of the forest are we in?</p>
<p>The new monster, a bat monster called <strong>Blat</strong>, can cast a Balloon spell, freezing a character!</p>
<p>We proceed southwest, where there&#39;s another obstacle barring us further!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/vr5w9Df.png alt="pillars block" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Pidge mentions that there&#39;s a blacksmith in Gaia&#39;s Navel who can craft axes, and suggests heading there in order to clear out the shrubbery.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I head east instead and fight off more Balloon casters and cute, but dangerous archers!</p>
<p>Next portal, where does it take us?</p>
<p>Oh no, an <strong>Eye Spy!</strong> It spawns more Chobin Hoods!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/PHtRmh5.png alt="eye spy" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I give up and retreat.</p>
<p>I stop by Neko&#39;s to get more healing items, some new equipment, and save again.</p>
<p>Using a Candy to heal Pidge, I head straight back to face the Eye Spy and the Chobin Hoods...</p>
<p>Now that&#39;s the first time that&#39;s happened: Hero got turned into a moogle!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/MKxCsWX.png alt=moogle width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Unfortunately, thanks to those Chobin Hoods, Hero sees the reaper, and is now a spirit walking!</p>
<p>I revive him, and with stubborn determination, we finish off the Chobin Hoods and the Eye Spy spawner!</p>
<p>We cross into the next portal...but it doesn&#39;t take us to another area. Instead, it clears out the mushrooms, and creates more land atop the cliff!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/8cL6SBQ.png alt="land change" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>To get to the land bridge, though, we really need the axe from the blacksmith in Gaia&#39;s Navel...</p>
<p>I seriously need to be careful with attacking in this game! One missed attack, and I waste my character&#39;s energy, and then, I have to wait for full power while the other monster takes their turn! Plus, I have to keep in mind of the mushrooms in the way here...</p>

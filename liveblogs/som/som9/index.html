<p>I start at the Water Palace, in the middle of the green torch-lit hall...and we leave for Neko&#39;s inn to check to see if he has more wares.</p>
<p>On the way there, I check the weapons Hero has...I have him try the new Spear on the Lullabud.</p>
<p>The Spear&#39;s one point stronger than the Sword, and it has a longer reach.</p>
<p>I buy more Candy from the salescat.</p>
<p>Outside again, more battling...</p>
<p>Down the river, I encounter two Froglike guards, no, goblins, who ambush and attack Hero with their axes, knocking him out! What the heck!?</p>

<p>Now Hero&#39;s inside a boiling pot, about to become the goblins&#39; next main course! <img class=emojione alt=ðŸ˜Ÿ title=:worried: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/1f61f.png></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/URTmGih.png alt="next course" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Hero:</strong> &quot;Haaaalp! Let me go!&quot;</p>
<p>The goblins really want a piece of Hero...but one of them shrieks, and the goblins&#39; dancing ritual begins!</p>
<p>During the dancing ceremony, a ponytailed girl sneaks from behind...what is she planning?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/QDBX4Yg.png alt="what is she planning" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Girl:</strong> &quot;Hey! Hey you! What on earth are you doing?&quot;</p>
<p>The girl saves Hero from being the main dish, causing him to jump from the boiling pot, and crash into a tree!</p>
<p>They leave the goblins&#39; camp quickly!</p>
<p>He asks her what she&#39;s doing in the woods. She mistook Hero for someone she was looking for...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/vxhDLG5.png alt="who is she?" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>She tells Hero that she&#39;s in a hurry and she has to go home. She runs off without even telling her name...</p>
<p>I have Hero read the &quot;beware of goblins&quot; sign before making haste!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>So the adorable spore-spouting mushroom is called a <strong>Mushboom</strong>...</p>
<p>Now at the crossroads, heading south...</p>
<p>Though the Spear&#39;s useful, only the Sword can cut through shrubs...I wish the Spear could cut through shrubs...</p>
<p>Nothing here but a small pond, and a steep cliff...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/kl2Glib.png alt="small corner pond" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>After taking care of another Lullabud and Rabite, I have Hero walk down the steps of the cliff into another bed of grass and a small pond in the corner.</p>
<p>The element of surprise is against Hero as a Mushboom&#39;s spores cause him to lose consciousness for a bit!</p>
<p>There&#39;s a cute yellow creature standing there.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/IMGzlUk.png alt="yellow creature" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I have Hero go and talk to the creature. The creature bounces Hero up, back to the small pond above!</p>
<p>Another bridge to cross, another Mushboom to take care of...</p>
<p>More monsters in our way...</p>
<p>I have Hero switch back to the Sword since there&#39;s a lot of grass in this area.</p>
<p>I read a sign near a bed of rocks...</p>

<p>It seems we&#39;re getting close to Pandora.</p>

<p>Now off to the Cannon Brother!</p>
<p>I have Pidge cast Stone Saber, imbuing Hero&#39;s Javelin with earth magic!</p>
<p>I try the newly enchanted weapon on the nearest Mushboom, petrifying the cute enemy!</p>
<p>We make it to the Cannon Brother...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/p38kFBi.png alt="destination change" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The destination of Pandora is now replaced with Upper Land.</p>
<p>The Cannon Bro tells us the Upper Land &quot;is huge,&quot; and that we can only go there by crossing through the great forest...</p>
<p>After his advice, we climb into the cannon...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/TCP2bKo.png alt="above upperland" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Where will we land?</p>
<p>We land in an epic sea of trees, down into a village of Moogles!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/AocuKb0.png alt="forest land" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Since this is his domain, it looks like Max is leading this time!</p>
<p>But he hit his head again when they landed, meaning he forgot where his home was again! Dangit, Cannon Guy!</p>
<p>Pidge&#39;s response is pointed.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/MI0kk6x.png alt=lovely width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We talk to a local Moogle. Pidge thinks he&#39;s laughing, but Max says he&#39;s not. He&#39;s sad...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/F9B8HRV.png alt=pebblers width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Who are these &quot;pebblers&quot; the Moogles are talking about?</p>
<p>I have Max lead the way.</p>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/NxW6oUEEYAo>The forest music here, or &quot;What the Forest Taught Me,&quot; is one of my favorite pieces in this game ever since I first heard it two years ago.</a></p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>In the northern end of the lake, we meet an old friend: Watts!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/wbxQjkR.png alt="hi watts" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>But just because the blacksmith&#39;s out of his forge, doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s not willing to help us, and gets down to business. He asks which of our weapons is ready for an upgrade...none so far.</p>
<p>We walk to the western part of the forest. Nothing here.</p>
<p>The trees here look beautiful...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/kbGrouu.png alt="periwinkle trees" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>There are two roads out of the periwinkle forest: the south and east.</p>
<p>In the east, it&#39;s autumnal looking. To the south, the forest is in bloom...</p>
<p>...where we see Neko, and another species of Rabite called a <strong>Silktail!</strong></p>
<p>We talk to Neko, who compliments the fine spring weather in the forest!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/EKd9w4L.png alt="neko compliments" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The enemies make it hard to enjoy it, though.</p>
<p>His newest item is a <strong>Quill Cap</strong>, which I get for Max. I also grab another Faerie Walnut...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Other new enemies here, such as a flying dragon and a <strong>Steamed Crab</strong>, who casts a Thunder Saber spell at himself!</p>
<p>And the Silktails are back!</p>
<p>One casts Acid Storm at Pidge, another heals his fellow Silktail!</p>
<p>I have Max spam Gem Missile at the enemies here...</p>
<p>Hmmm, why is there a flying dragon around this part of the forest? I&#39;m thinking it might be an enemy, but no attacks are affecting it...maybe it&#39;s too quick...</p>
<p>I have the party wander around the beautiful spring woods...</p>
<p>Max is almost out of MP...</p>
<p>We head to the west, where the forest is now summer looking...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/6ugmYh0.png alt="summer forest" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The place is beautiful, but still dangerous...</p>
<p>We run into a crystal orb, and I have Max Freeze the orb...</p>
<p>...which has no effect...</p>
<p>I try an Earth Slide. Nothing happens.</p>
<p>We head north where we see more monsters, and a dead end...I also see another new monster, a spiky <strong>Crawler</strong> with cute eyes.</p>
<p>Knowing that I have a weapon that insects don&#39;t like, I have Hero equip the very, very bad Power Glove, and use it on the Crawler!</p>
<p>After one final but failed attempt to activate the crystal orb, I head back to the spring part of the forest and take the east route...</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>...to another part of the forest with a lake, where Water Thugs patrol the area!</p>
<p>The Water Thugs are good at long range attacks!</p>
<p>After taking care of them, I take another pic of the scenery here.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/W0EGkkR.png alt="forest scenery" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I wonder, is this <strong>Secret of Mana</strong>&#39;s version of <strong>Super Mario RPG</strong>&#39;s Forest Maze?</p>
<p>We take the northeast path back into the autumn part of the forest...</p>
<p>We come across a <strong>Nemesis Owl</strong>, and get the drop on him! I&#39;m very suspicious of this enemy...</p>
<p>The owl&#39;s KO animation is feathers falling...</p>
<p>Near the path back into the Moogle Forest, we see another owl!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/O8h3PZD.png alt="another owl" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We continue around the autumn forest, and do more level grinding...</p>
<p>My suspicions are confirmed as another Nemesis Owl casts a Silence spell on Max, confusing him! My movement controls are now reversed!</p>
<p>We head back south to the large lake and take the east road, where we see another Cannon Bro!</p>
<p>He can take us back near Gaia&#39;s Navel, or near Potos Village.</p>
<p>But I decide to explore the forest a bit more...</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Taking the northwest path in the lake area, the music changes back to the usual battle music...</p>
<p>The blue-spined hedgehog burrowers are the <strong>Pebblers</strong> the Moogles warned us about!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/sSTeQOP.png alt=pebblers width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>And they&#39;re quick to approach us through burrowing!</p>
<p>We accidentally head back to the forest lake...</p>
<p>These Pebblers are quick!</p>
<p>Their spinning rock throw attacks are also pretty formidable...</p>
<p>I have Max absorb one of their health...</p>
<p>...and seeing Hero&#39;s almost KO&#39;d, I use a Chocolate Bar to heal him!</p>
<p>Eventually Max takes care of one Pebbler!</p>
<p>We get the rest of the Pebblers, and turn to leave...</p>
<p>We now get a prompt saying that the Moogles can return here safe and sound! So this is their village...</p>
<p><a name=6></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Watts is also in the village&#39;s garden...</p>
<p>One of the Moogles is overjoyed and thanks us for clearing out the Pebblers!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/kFfuUXm.png alt="moogle thank you" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>But Max&#39;s head begins to hurt again...he leaps and topples over!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/T4UjTgS.png alt="max head hurt again" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Looks like Max got his memory back! He gives us a tip to enter his homeland in the forest:</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/qX9A2b5.png alt=riddle width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>So we walk the parts of the forest from <strong>spring</strong> to <strong>winter</strong>, and then back to <strong>spring</strong>, near where the crystal orb is.</p>
<p>I open the chests here as well...</p>
<p>...which have a <strong>Glove&#39;s Orb</strong> and an <strong>Axe&#39;s Orb!</strong></p>
<p>Seeing Neko nearby, I stop and save here!</p>
<p>What a long session!</p>
<p>Also, I noticed just now that we landed in the winter part of the Upper Land!</p>

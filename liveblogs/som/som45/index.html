<p>Time to return to Kakkara! Let&#39;s see if I can find the Cannon back home...</p>
<p>But while writing, I decide to pay a visit to Santa&#39;s cottage.</p>
<p>Rudolph thanks us for freeing Santa!</p>
<p>Santa vows to work hard to make children believe in him again...while walking around in his cottage!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/VNqoHnP.png alt="santa walking" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I check the weapons that are in need of upgrades: the Bow, the Glove, the Boomerang, and the Spear.</p>
<p>Off to the cannon!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/vpmrlS4.png alt="ice cannon" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The Cannon Guy gives us a few destinations: Matango or Kakkara.</p>
<p>We head off to Kakkara, with a friendly warning from the cannon guy to not get stranded...</p>
<p>The cannon fires us from one side of the world to the other!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/XWok06x.png alt="above kakkara" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We land in the center of town, near a dancing citizen!</p>
<p>King Amar mentions a Faerie Walnut, then refers to the Mana Seed we have. He warns us to beware of monsters along the way.</p>
<p>The dancer thinks there&#39;s a town like Kakkara in Ice Country, but we tell her the bad news...</p>
<p><strong>Dancer:</strong> &quot;Huh? All gone?&quot;</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>After restocking, we start the quest to return this Mana Seed to the Fire Palace!</p>
<p>The stairs to the dais are still locked!</p>
<p>Now we have to unlock the stairs...</p>
<p>Seems the Robin Foot doesn&#39;t like wind magic...</p>
<p>We head down to the hot area of the shrine, where there are <strong>Dark Funks</strong>, angry blue clouds, there!</p>
<p>But since the heat becomes too unbearable for us (and it gets hard to see anything), we head back up!</p>
<p>After going around the palace and finding no other routes, we head back to that hot cavern!</p>
<p>I see a crystal orb. Analyzing it, it seems that Salamando&#39;s magic will have an effect.</p>
<p>I have Max cast a Fireball on the orb. No good.</p>
<p>The Dark Funks throw a Blaze Wall on us!</p>
<p>With most of the party surrounded by flames, it takes a while before I have Max cast another spell again...</p>
<p>I use the last of Max&#39;s magic to explode the orb! It worked!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/1RPhG4S.png alt="heat cleared up" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The heat dissipates...and we&#39;re now left with these angry purple, not blue, clouds!</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>After freezing the angry clouds, we go upstairs at the northeast staircase.</p>
<p>Now we&#39;re in a different part of the palace...</p>
<p>We see another Red Drop, and, after a short fight, escape to the south chamber.</p>
<p>Upstairs, there&#39;s more Robin Foots and floating flames!</p>
<p>On the west side of the room, there&#39;s another crystal orb!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/IYEmXvv.png alt="floating flames" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We throw a fireball at it, causing the orb to disappear!</p>
<p>More Robin Foots to take care of in this room...</p>
<p>Instead of heading for the staircase, we follow the hall of flames into a room with a chest, containing 1,000 gold!</p>
<p>The next floor&#39;s a maze, where there are some staircases around...</p>
<p>We fall for the first treasure trap where Hero turns into stone!</p>
<p>We head for the western steps leading down...</p>
<p>We make it into a chamber of Robin Foots, with thin walls and flames blocking the way.</p>
<p>The end is rewarding, as we win another <strong>Axe&#39;s Orb</strong>!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/VVp7ZIw.png alt="glass window" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>What a beautiful stained glass window...</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We go back up and take the second staircase down...</p>
<p>...into another hall of enemies!</p>
<p>There&#39;s tons of Mallards and Dark Funks in this room...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/aQDy9o8.png alt="circle of flames" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>This place has a lot of screenshot-worthy sites...a circle of flames dancing around a platform is one of them.</p>
<p>Oh my god, I never realized how huge this palace is! Or maybe, the enemies here make this palace a longer trek than usual...</p>
<p>We head to the center staircase, where we&#39;re now on the other side of the east entrance chamber!</p>
<p>I have Hero push on the button to open up the east wall!</p>
<p>Up the staircase and a hop away to another staircase!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/zgiI6RB.png alt="hop away" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Back at that mini maze and up another staircase, where we&#39;re now in a room full of unlit braziers.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/VbIxFM1.png alt="unlit braziers" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I press the button to light them all up, and reveal a crystal orb.</p>
<p>This orb seems to respond with Salamando&#39;s magic...no go...</p>
<p>We have to freeze the orb!</p>
<p>Freezing the orb doused all the braziers except for two of them.</p>
<p>By standing in between the lit braziers, the dais where the orb used to be sinks, and raises the stairway to the Mana Seed chamber!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/M9lMYUy.png alt="stairway revealed" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>But I&#39;m wrong, as I get treated to another boss!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ydDhE7K.png alt=minotaur width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>It&#39;s a <strong>Minotaur!</strong></p>
<p>He casts a level 7 (!) Earth Slide on Hero and pushes him to the edge of the platform with his horns!</p>
<p>His strength makes me more cautious of the party...</p>
<p>I use up the last Walnut for Max.</p>
<p>Knowing the boss can cast Earth spells, I counter with Thunderbolts and Air Blasts!</p>
<p><strong>It&#39;s ultra super effective!!</strong></p>
<p>Now he&#39;s turning red!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/q0NoIEn.png alt="turning red" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>He charges at Max, but fails to connect! I use up one more Air Blast, and enjoy the fireworks!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/CQ5O2qR.png alt="fireworks minotaur" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Another <strong>Javelin&#39;s Orb</strong> is our reward!</p>
<p><a name=6></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Now we head forward to the Mana Seed chamber.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Ji6g8ZH.png alt="mana seed" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I have Hero hold the sword up to the Mana Seed!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/97NmYya.png alt="charge sword" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We now have four Mana Seeds charged! Yes!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/98hce92.png alt="four mana seeds" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>All the monsters have vanished!</p>
<p>It&#39;s smooth sailing from here...</p>
<p>I grab the last chest I saw on the way down to the hot cavern part of the palace.</p>
<p>We slide down and head back to Kakkara Kingdom.</p>
<p>For the boss of this palace, I thought he was going to be super difficult, but after casting the first wind spell on him, I realized I could beat him effortlessly!</p>

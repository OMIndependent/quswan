<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> From the online guide, I learn that in order to dispel the Wall spell on enemies, Max needs to have his dark magic up to level 6! I&#39;m also reminded that the Dark Stalkers do not like light magic, along with the Shadows in Joch&#39;s Cave! I should&#39;ve taken the chance to build up Pidge&#39;s light magic facing those guys, but the heavy MP cost wasn&#39;t worth it...</p>
<p>Before going to the Sunken Continent, I notice a tiny island in the south with a tower here...by the way the tower&#39;s structured, this probably must be a lighthouse.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/o6i9SmZ.png alt=lighthouse width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>How many flights of stairs does this lighthouse have?</p>
<p>At the top, after going up four flights of stairs, there&#39;s a bald man spinning around in circles...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/lsXI9rr.png alt="bald man spinning" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We speak to him, where he introduces himself.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Ihw8VfI.png alt=pecard width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Hmmmm...</p>
<p>He tells us about the sunken continent, and the Tree Palace there.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/bjsBYQC.png alt=continent width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Pecard:</strong> &quot;The power of the ancients must have been really incredible!&quot; <a href=http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Jean-Luc_Picard>Like his namesake</a>, he&#39;s probably into archaeology.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Inside the Underground City now, I wish there was a shortcut around here...</p>
<p>In the empty chambers where we met Watts and Krissie, they&#39;re gone! They must have moved up ahead!</p>
<p>I also learn that drain powers don&#39;t work on Ghouls! They always backfire, just like in <em>Final Fantasy</em>!</p>
<p>It&#39;s a long trek to get from one place to another...</p>
<p>So now that we beat the Kettle Kin, we can now head back up to the Tree Palace?! </p>
<p>I restock up on Walnuts and other items and heal before taking on the <strong>Grand Palace</strong>...</p>
<p>Back to our old nemesis, the Heck Hound, whose howls for reinforcements unsettle me a bit...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/eVBapzW.png alt="heck hound" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>There&#39;s also a will-o-wisp hanging by the stairs, which is actually a <strong>Gremlin</strong>, the Imp&#39;s stronger cousin!</p>
<p>The Gremlin&#39;s weak against light magic, but he&#39;s got a high magic defense...</p>
<p>The <strong>Doom Sword</strong> and <strong>Turtlance</strong> are also new...</p>
<p>We climb up to see more Gremlins blocking both wings of the second floor hallway...</p>
<p>Seeing a nearby whipping post, I realize there&#39;s another ledge to jump over to!</p>
<p>Analyzing the Heck Hound, he has a weakness to light magic!</p>
<p>Southwards to a corridor, where I&#39;m faced with another Doom Sword...the whip&#39;s more accurate than the sword here. I also demo Max&#39;s Dispel Magic, which removes the earth weapon buff the Sword casts itself with!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/v5Z5res.png alt="to third floor" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Up to the third floor, where more Gremlins and a Heck Hound are there!</p>
<p>I take to the west corridor, where I&#39;m greeted with more troops. Unable to hit that quick Gremlin, I go back to the north chamber. Then, I notice a chest behind a Doom Sword...</p>
<p>Opening it reveals another <strong>Sword upgrade!</strong></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/WVVEmsp.png alt="sword upgrade" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>After seeing another dead end (why does this game have dead ends?), I go back to the northern chamber, and see a Turtlance transforming into a mini-tank! This must be another Imperial-made monster...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Up the eastern staircase we go, and down again to a punchable switch...</p>
<p>...opening up the center portcullis!</p>
<p>We fight more monsters, where I learn that the Turtlance also acts like a fast car...</p>
<p>Ahead, more monsters surround us...</p>
<p>After awhile, we climb up to the fourth floor, and survey around, Fireballing Turtlances...</p>
<p>There&#39;s a dark-covered tome called a <strong>National Scar</strong>. I wonder why the developers called that monster by that name...</p>
<p>Like most monsters here, the book monster does not like light magic!</p>
<p>Its specialty is to summon other monsters!</p>
<p>It seems we have to go back, since we&#39;re stuck at a dead end again, and we can&#39;t hit the monsters since they&#39;re at lower ground...</p>
<p>Now at the first floor, I press on to the arch ahead.</p>
<p>Fending off the Gremlins and Heck Hound here, I head inside the east set of doors...</p>
<p>...into a chamber with Doom Swords!</p>
<p>After taking care of one of the swords, I grab a piece of equipment: a <strong>Guardian Ring!</strong> What a rare drop!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/rFgkkex.png alt="doom sword last" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>It takes huge time and effort to take care of this other Doom Sword, but we manage!</p>
<p>At the north edge of the room, there&#39;s a National Scar guarding a crystal orb that activates with water magic!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/56g6jYQ.png alt="water orb activate" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Now what did that do?</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Ignoring that, I go to the west chamber, where the only difference is the palette of the room...it looks more browner in tones.</p>
<p>Another crystal orb here, and this one is receptive to earth magic...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/LtpB59n.png alt="earth chamber" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Activating the orb here caused the platform it stood on to rise...</p>
<p>I head back up to the second floor to see if anything&#39;s changed.</p>
<p>And Gremlins are strong against drain magic!</p>
<p>Taking the advice of not attacking anything that&#39;s too quick I notice the platforms for the west door here have lowered and I proceed inside.</p>
<p>It&#39;s the same room as the two previous ones...</p>
<p>The crystal orb here is receptive to wind magic...</p>
<p>Now for the east room...</p>
<p>Knowing from the palette of the room and the fiery braziers here, the crystal orb&#39;s receptive to fire magic.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/J1kyfRo.png alt="fire chamber" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I immediately Fireball the orb, and that&#39;s the last of the orbs here!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/kCfstLN.png alt="fire orb activate" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Outside the chamber, a Heck Hound howls at our presence!</p>
<p>After taking care of him, Hero&#39;s now at level 50!!!</p>
<p>Jumping past two ledges again to get to the fourth floor, where nothing&#39;s changed here so far...</p>
<p>Down at the third floor, we can now cross into the double doors here!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/CWZ04UY.png alt="double doors third floor" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>This is the light chamber we entered into...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/iZAsXFZ.png alt="light chamber" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Now for the chamber of darkness in the east room...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/W0YR8UI.png alt="darkness chamber" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Fourth floor, here we come! There&#39;s now staircases for us to cross down to!</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Along with a troop of enemies to take care of...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/T9vpo9V.png alt="fourth floor" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>After taking care of a Doom Sword in the south end of this floor, Pidge is now at level 50!!!</p>
<p>Stop your creepy howling, Heck Hound!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/zw0EcOe.png alt="end of hall fourth floor" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>After he&#39;s down, we finally make it to the staircase before the fifth and final floor!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/R5Wn1Ao.png alt="fifth floor" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Or not the final floor, as we go through more puzzles again!</p>
<p>We jump over to the southwest ledge, where there&#39;s nothing forward for us to cross over to...</p>
<p>After pressing on a switchpad southwest, a staircase down opens! The next one we press opens the Heck Hound&#39;s cage!</p>
<p>Into another set of double doors, and into a golden chamber with a crystal orb!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Bm10DfX.png alt="lunar chamber" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I have Max use Lunar Magic on the orb, which works!</p>
<p>Now for the east wing here...</p>
<p>Instead of a set of doors, there&#39;s a passage of stairs. This is probably going to take us to the tree chamber...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/VTjiblK.png alt="tunnel top floor" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><a name=6></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Pressing the switchpad up here automatically moves the whole party to the stage, where there&#39;s another cute lizard!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/O6waBPk.png alt="snap dragon" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The lizard&#39;s a <strong>Snap Dragon</strong>, not a Biting Lizard this time! He grew pretty fast from that egg he hatched out of!</p>
<p>He starts opening and closing his mouth now! He&#39;s really hungry!</p>
<p>Max is his first meal!</p>
<p>And he&#39;s a quick leaper too!</p>
<p>Max takes massive damage everytime he&#39;s kicked out of the lizard&#39;s belly!</p>
<p>Like his blue cousin, he can heal too!</p>
<p>As a last resort, I cast Defender on everyone!</p>
<p>I read that the Snap Dragon is weak against fire, and I have Max cast Exploder...</p>
<p>...<strong>it&#39;s super effective!!!</strong></p>
<p>I continue spamming Exploder spells on the cute yet dangerous lizard!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/QVEhvMe.png alt=exploder width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The lizard swallows Pidge!</p>
<p>But two more Exploders do the job!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/vcln2cY.png alt="poor snapdragon" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We win a Javelin&#39;s Orb and the bridge back outside&#39;s open!</p>
<p>I leave the Sunken Continent for now, and fly to the Lofty Mountains...</p>
<p>Time for more upgrades, as I have Watts reforge everything that&#39;s ready.</p>
<p><strong>Elfin Bow</strong> to <strong>Wing Bow</strong><br>
<strong>Imp&#39;s Fork</strong> to <strong>Elf&#39;s Harpoon</strong><br>
<strong>Masamune</strong> to <strong>Gigas Sword</strong></p>
<p>Here are the current weapons I have now:</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/RZl1Ysl.png alt="new upgrades yay!" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The Wing Bow is a confusion-inflicting bow, the Elf&#39;s Harpoon, I&#39;m thinking, is meant for Max, and the Gigas Sword has the same effect as the Gigas Lance.</p>
<p>Tbqh, I found the Snap Dragon to be cuter than the Biting Lizard, which probably makes that lizard even more dangerous!</p>

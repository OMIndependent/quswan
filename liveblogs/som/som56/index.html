<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>Reading from an online guide, it seems that we fought the phantom blob in the Mana Seed chamber the whole time!</p>
<p>I missed a Glove Orb in the Palace of Darkness as well, so I turn back there and find that room I missed...</p>
<p>That room with the Glove&#39;s Orb is in the center room in the entrance hall!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/TUR20CD.png alt="glove orb center" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Since I&#39;m already playing, I decide to make the climb back to the peak cave. Hopefully, Sage Joch&#39;s there now...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/yMg0dp6.png alt=cliff width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>During the climb, I do a little demo of Max&#39;s dark magic. Evil Gate&#39;s got a big MP cost! I use it on an Eggatrice above us!</p>
<p>We make it to the cave, where Jehk tells us again that Joch&#39;s out!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/wfc2xsN.png alt="out to gold isle" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Oh my god!!!</strong></p>
<p>So he&#39;s at <strong>Gold Isle</strong> this time, huh?</p>
<p>I take care of a few monsters outside the cave before calling Flammie!</p>
<p>Gold City, here we come!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>From a woman, we get a taste of the high cost to live here...this place is definitely meant for the one-percenters...</p>
<p>The weight of the gold is causing the island to sink! Even the trees here are golden!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/0JG8hRs.png alt="golden tree" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The furniture of the interiors are also lined with beige or gold!</p>
<p>In the shop, there&#39;s plenty of new equipment here: a <strong>Lazuri Ring</strong>, a <strong>Shield Ring</strong>, a <strong>Battle Suit</strong>, a <strong>Flower Suit</strong>, a <strong>Dragon Helm</strong>, a <strong>Duck Helm</strong>, and a <strong>Unicorn Helm!</strong></p>
<p>Hoo boy...getting the new equipment is tempting...</p>
<p>I spend sparingly on the Flower Suit and Dragon Helm...</p>
<p>From the stat boosts, these are high-tier equipment!</p>
<p>A guard tells us the <strong>Golden Tower</strong> is at the north exit. Like very important places, it can&#39;t be entered by travelers...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/gbHTQ51.png alt="tower entrance" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The place looks beautiful.</p>
<p>But like the guard says, we can&#39;t go in because the tower&#39;s locked!</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We head east into a gated estate...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/V6a1nA4.png alt="mammon mansion entrance" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>King Manmon&#39;s probably the mayor or governor of Gold Isle, and probably his name was originally <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammon>Mammon</a>, but because of Nintendo&#39;s Practices &amp; Standards at the time the game was released, the translator had to change the name by a letter.</p>
<p>Why would Sage Joch visit a fancy place like this? Does he know King Manmon?</p>
<p>We head southwest into a weapons shop, where Watts is behind the counter...I wonder how he follows us all the time?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/a1k9L2K.png alt="watts behind counter" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I decide to upgrade the Heavy Glove into a...</p>
<p>...<strong>Hyper-Fist</strong>, with very mean wolverine claws!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/jXJxB3L.png alt="upgrade weapons" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Checking my weapons, the Imp&#39;s Fork balloons enemies, while the Hyper-Fist is useful against slimes and lizards!</p>
<p>We go into the building next door...it&#39;s a tavern...</p>
<p>The woman&#39;s &quot;jealous&quot; that everyone around her is moving to the &quot;resort&quot; in the Ice Country...</p>
<p>I scale around the walls of the city...</p>
<p>I find more info from the man walking on the wall&#39;s perimeter here that the Golden Tower is the <strong>Light Palace!</strong></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/lDIphaj.png alt="light palace" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>He has more info to give away regarding where the key to the tower went...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/UeCCoNs.png alt="spy stole key" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/MBgepMs.png alt="key was never found" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I answer the man&#39;s question in my head that there&#39;s probably an Elemental (Yhzvan, V&#39;z thrffvat) and if there is an Elemental, that means there&#39;s a Mana Seed!</p>
<p>So now we know there&#39;s a Mana Seed here in Gold Isle!</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We brush past the dancing innkeeper and try to get more info from the residents in Manmon&#39;s mansion...</p>
<p>Two ladies are greedy for gold.</p>
<p>I see the King with his Queen by his side.</p>
<p>But I talk to his servant before speaking with him...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/nPN7bat.png alt=alchemy width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>So I&#39;m guessing King Manmon is an alchemist...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/yMVy2ea.png alt="king manmon" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>No information from them, they&#39;re still basking in their wealth...it&#39;s a bit sickening to see that, imo.</p>
<p>The innkeeper has a high price for a night: 200 gold!</p>
<p>No Sage Joch here, but I&#39;ll probably have to go back to Southtown and find that spy.</p>
<p>It turns out Mara&#39;s husband&#39;s the spy who stole the tower key!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Il0PQZE.png alt="husband spy" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>And Mara found the key while looking through her husband&#39;s things!</p>
<p>But, she wants her husband back in exchange for the key...</p>
<p>Nevertheless, she still gives the key to us, hoping we reunite her with her husband. </p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/UTLYm8m.png alt="gold tower key get" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I rest and save at Manmon&#39;s mansion before tackling the tower!</p>

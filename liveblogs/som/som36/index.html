<p>Into the dragon caves we go!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/fD55Cn1.png alt=entrance width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>But first, I have to cross a mushroom maze filled with enemies before getting inside the cave proper!</p>
<p>I switch Hero&#39;s weapon to a Power Glove and continue on...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/XQuzpn2.png alt="what a maze" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>What a maze this place is!</p>
<p>The Water Thug can also do spin attacks!?</p>
<p>Alright, a few more monsters, and a lot of spells to cast here...</p>
<p>I seriously need to get more Medical Herbs now...</p>
<p>I&#39;m now inside the dragon cave, where the typical battle music&#39;s playing this time...</p>
<p>We climb to the second floor of the cave.</p>
<p>I have Max cast Gem Missile on the Kimono Bird, which causes ultra-effective damage!!!</p>
<p>There&#39;s plenty of chasms in this cave!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/YwjuP4J.png alt=chasms width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We go to higher ground and I have Hero and Pidge switch weapons to cross to another ledge!</p>
<p>The Kimono Bird, I realize, is the one that spawns the Pebblers!</p>
<p>We head downstairs again and take care of a Kimono Bird before ledge jumping via whip again...</p>
<p>I&#39;ll have to stick with Hero using the whip this time in any case we run into other spires to use as jumping posts...</p>
<p>We climb down another set of steps...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>...where we get a crowd of Kimono Birds and Pebblers awaiting us!</p>
<p>Now which staircase should I take?</p>
<p>I go down the eastern one first.</p>
<p>Nothing here but rocks...</p>
<p>I go back and head up to the west...</p>
<p>The whip doesn&#39;t seem to work on Pebblers, probably because they&#39;re too quick or too small to hit!</p>
<p>This cave is the most complex to traverse around...up one minute, and down the next! Plus, there&#39;s monsters to worry about here!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/YGer1d1.png alt="lost in cave" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Fighting monsters, though, is leagues better than solving a very complicated puzzle any day!</p>
<p>We climb up another set of stairs...</p>
<p>...and after taking care of very quick Pebblers, we find another crystal orb at the end of the passage!</p>
<p>I have Max use an Air Blast. No effect.</p>
<p>I have Pidge Analyze the orb. Only earth magic&#39;s effective on this orb!</p>
<p>A Gem Missile won&#39;t work, so maybe an Earth Slide will do...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>...it works, and Max&#39;s earth magic levels up to 3!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/3qYeyzn.png alt="sound of falling rock" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I go down and head back to that area with the two staircases...</p>
<p>Still nothing there!</p>
<p>Back up, where I fight more Kimono Birds.</p>
<p>While heading back to the crystal orb room, a Kimono Bird unleashes his Thunderbolt on Hero!</p>
<p>Destroying the orb cleared out the stalagmites in the middle passage!</p>
<p>Now I take the flight of stairs down...</p>
<p>...to where more Kimono Birds await!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/oqwB7LU.png alt="kimono bird ambush" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Gem Missiles on both of them!</p>
<p>A big open tunnel here might lead us to where the dragon is!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/mSXRaqm.png alt="big wide tunnel" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>But as soon as we enter the tunnel, leading us outside, danger greets us again!</p>
<p>There&#39;s a huge snake slithering about the wood!</p>
<p>It casts its level 5 Gem Missiles on Pidge!</p>
<p>It hisses and crawls by Pidge!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/qFAZsfi.png alt="snake crawls by" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Unfortunately, as soon as the snake touches us we get &quot;pygmized,&quot; or we get hit with a Mini status!</p>
<p>And Max falls to the reaper!</p>
<p>The snake, or the <strong>Great Viper</strong>&#39;s, fracking fast!!</p>
<p>I have Hero whip at the Viper&#39;s head! It seems to work!</p>
<p>After tons of recovery, I decide to take control of Pidge and switch her weapon to the whip!</p>
<p>I have Pidge Analyze the Great Viper: it hates wind magic!</p>
<p>Before casting, Max falls again, and so does Hero!</p>
<p>This is chaos...</p>
<p>I revive both of them...</p>
<p>I manage to have Max use his Thunderbolt spell on the Viper!</p>
<p>An Air Blast, and another Thunderbolt are also added!</p>
<p>I have a now Mini!Pidge use up the last Faerie Walnut on Max! This sprite is our only hope now!</p>
<p>Two more Thunderbolts and that tough snake is gone!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/UWNf2GM.png alt="snake vanished" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We get a <strong>Sword&#39;s Orb</strong> as a reward for finishing him!</p>
<p>The Spikey Tiger may have been tough, but this Great Viper&#39;s more difficult, imo!</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We press on ahead, the dragon must be close!</p>
<p>This tunnel must lead to where the dragon is!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/iKnI4qQ.png alt="another wide tunnel" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>There&#39;s plenty of lights peering through this part of the cave...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/sA6K7kq.png alt="white dragon" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>There&#39;s the white dragon!</p>
<p>But more sad news...</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>This is the legendary white dragon?</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/woIugeK.png alt="parents gone" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Pidge tells us the dragon won&#39;t survive if we leave him in the cave. She suggests going back to King Truffle to tend to him.</p>
<p>Back at Fung Castle, the dragon&#39;s sitting next to King Truffle. Truffle immediately takes on the task of caring for him...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/axFzvNq.png alt="im taking care of him" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The Nobleman tries to object, but King Truffle won&#39;t have it!</p>
<p><strong>Truffle:</strong> &quot;You three get going. I&#39;ll take care of him! By the way, how do you like the name &#39;Flammie&#39;?&quot;</p>
<p>We&#39;re given a decision, but the King stops us before we could decide.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/oZpUnw5.png alt="you wont like name no matter" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I&#39;m guessing King Truffle might not like our name for the dragon, and decides that <strong>Flammie</strong> is the white dragon&#39;s name!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/dNk2pwi.png alt="cannon guy" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Yes!!! The Cannon Guy got his fuses for the cannon!</p>
<p><a name=6></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Now that the Cannon Guy has his fuses, the King gives us our next destination!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/gL3MKU2.png alt=kakkara width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The <strong>Fire Palace</strong> in the <strong>Desert of Kakkara...</strong></p>
<p>I talk to the King again, who says Flammie&#39;s fine!</p>
<p>Flammie lets out a happy yelp.</p>
<p>The Nobleman knows that Hero is the Knight of Legend.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Fdw5W7F.png alt=nobleman width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>One Mushboom couldn&#39;t believe a white dragon&#39;s standing before him!</p>
<p>Another Mushboom thinks he&#39;s too small, since he&#39;s &quot;seen &#39;em bigger.&quot;</p>
<p>I head back to Watts for more upgrades.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve now got more than 10,000 gold!</p>
<p>I upgrade all that I have!</p>
<p><strong>Javelin</strong> -&gt; <strong>Light Trident</strong><br>
The So Bad <strong>Power Glove</strong> -&gt; <strong>Moogle Claws</strong><br>
<strong>Herald Sword</strong> -&gt; <strong>Claymore</strong></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Yra720H.png alt="weapon checking" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The Claymore and Moogle Claws are gold plated, while the Light Trident is emerald tipped!</p>
<p>The Claymore&#39;s effective on insects, the Moogle Claws cause sleep on its enemies, and the Light Trident&#39;s effect is the same as the Javelin&#39;s before it.</p>
<p>I have the party rest up...</p>
<p>So our next stop is the <strong>Desert of Kakkara</strong> for the fourth Mana Seed...</p>

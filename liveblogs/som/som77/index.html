<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>I check my weapons and stats so far...</p>
<p>Oh my god, Hero&#39;s got high Defense and Magic Defense stats!</p>
<p>I make the last upgrade on the Hyper-Fist, which become <strong>Griffin Claws!</strong></p>
<p>Now we call Flammie and head to the Tree Palace to get fully equipped!</p>
<p>Our final destination awaits...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/NjZR0Mn.png alt=fortress width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>It takes a bit of chasing, but Flammie makes it inside!</p>
<p>No flashing cannons and barriers to stop our landing this time...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/pU8bfBT.png alt="fortress entrance" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>At the top of the staircase, two Capt. Ducks await our arrival!</p>
<p>We put them to sleep for awhile...and another Dark Stalker joins the fray!</p>
<p>A new monster here, the <strong>Fiend Head</strong>, really likes dispelling all our buffs, and breathing poison!</p>
<p>And spawning Dark Stalkers! Why do monsters in this game always do this?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/wR4CSbZ.png alt="entrance to fortress" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We head inside the entrance of the Mana Fortress, where the music&#39;s now changed! <a href=https://youtu.be/gHKczi3mOOk>I like this track.</a></p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Two <strong>Metal Crab</strong>s appear as we enter.</p>
<p>Turtlances and a blue sludge called a <strong>Tsunami</strong> are in the next chamber....</p>
<p>It seems we&#39;ll have to use a whip to reach the other side again...</p>
<p>After a few minutes taking care of the Tsunamis, I press the pink button, opening the bridge!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/tmIMEt6.png alt="bridge open" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The next wave of monsters continue going after us!</p>
<p>A <strong>Wolf Lord</strong> (the Werewolf&#39;s cousin) and his two Heck Hounds are our next challenge!</p>
<p>Like his Werewolf cousin, he&#39;s a super black belt, and a spellcaster!</p>
<p>There&#39;s a huge chasm below us now and green crystals blocking our path forward!</p>
<p>The sword&#39;s able to cut through the crystals with ease! However, they regenerate so quickly!</p>
<p>There&#39;s so many Tsunamis to face here...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/9ZQUDon.png alt=tsunamis width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Instead of west, we jump over to the south ledge, hoping we might get some items! Instead, we end up in a room full of crystals!</p>
<p>We turn back and go west, facing off against more Heck Hounds!</p>
<p>The golden eye orb here&#39;s called a <strong>Whimper</strong>...</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there&#39;s no way through and we go back to the chamber with the green crystals...</p>
<p>It takes two or three hits to cut these crystals with the sword! Late-game <strong>Mana</strong> really means business!</p>
<p>The stray switch here, like in the coral reef cave at the Underground City, resets the crystals again!</p>
<p>While the Whimper turns Max into a moogle, it casts Reflect on itself!</p>
<p>We trudge through the yard of crystals and make it to the room north...</p>
<p>...then south, where we jump across a far ledge, and a twist and a turn later...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>...we take a warp to another boss flying above the huge chasm below! It&#39;s another Vampire called <strong>Buffy!</strong> <del>Hmmm...is this name referring to the Vampire Slayer?</del></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/bcs8fzJ.png alt="buffy boss" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I proceed to restore Pidge&#39;s magic, and buff everyone with light magic!</p>
<p>Buffy snaps their fingers, casting their magic!</p>
<p>Buffy also knows how to pull a Leaden Glare...</p>
<p>Knowing we&#39;re stuck in a tight spot, we head down the stairs, into the void floor...now the battle feels more open...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/AxVwgW6.png alt="void floor" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I honestly thought that was a big chasm below for some reason...</p>
<p>Buffy also knows dark magic too, huh?</p>
<p>As soon as Buffy touches down, they start chomping on Max! Like their cousin, they can poison us with their claws!</p>
<p>We take advantage of Buffy&#39;s landings and continue using our light-enchanted weapons on Buffy...</p>
<p>Now Buffy takes to the skies, and it&#39;s now a spellcasting duel!</p>
<p>Buffy finally touches down, and goes after Pidge!</p>
<p>One more hit from Hero&#39;s spear, and Buffy&#39;s the one that gets slain!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/XZ74CF3.png alt="buffy slain" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>What do we win this time?</p>
<p>Nothing!</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Two more Heck Hounds and their reinforcements are in the next room!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Ij1MKhW.png alt="two corridors" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Two corridors diverge here...I take the east one...</p>
<p>...where a Shape Shifter greets us with his smug grin, and more troops of monsters await!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Txz0nqq.png alt="trio maze" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Now to cross through this maze...</p>
<p>We make it through, fighting another trio of Tsunamis along the way...</p>
<p>We open the long bridge to another warp point, where we&#39;re faced with another giant slime monster, the <strong>Dread Slime!</strong></p>
<p>I analyze the gigantic gelatin, who&#39;s weak against dark magic!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/XNgkcdz.png alt="dread slime" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>This boss is only vulnerable to Dark Force...every physical hit doesn&#39;t seem to work...</p>
<p>As the boss continues to spam Acid Storms on the party, I counter with Dark Force!</p>
<p>Every time the spell makes its mark, the Dread Slime keeps growing!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/vTg44uv.png alt="dread slime grows" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>But after a few more dark magic spells (where the Dread Slime expands so much that we can&#39;t even move!), the fireworks show for the Dread Slime starts!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/6U3gdvL.png alt="dread slime gone" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>It takes us a while before we get warped to another part of the fortress!</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Turning back, we get into another round with Tsunamis, and Hero gets stuck because of their endless spellcasting! We manage to push them back, and win a rare item, an <strong>Amulet Ring</strong>, from them!</p>
<p>I give Pidge the rare piece of equipment, and go to that west corridor to see if there&#39;s anything there...</p>
<p>The tricky thing about this game&#39;s menu (the Ring Command menu) sometimes is the menu switching.</p>
<p>Now that Hero&#39;s Spear skills are at level 7, I have him swap weapons with Max!</p>
<p>Tsunamis, though a bit overwhelming, give us some more Amulet Rings!</p>
<p>We do some backtracking and exploring around this fortress...it&#39;s easy to get lost in this elaborate place!</p>
<p>We end up going around in circles!</p>
<p>Now back to the warp point after we took care of the last boss...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/1Qr4msl.png alt="back after dread slime" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>More Dark Stalkers with a <strong>Master Ninja</strong> at the north end of the next room try to stop us!</p>
<p>We take care of the ninjas and proceed to where the <strong>Terminator</strong>, a gold-plated knight, is...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/9JCOClF.png alt=terminator width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>And we leap past another gap!</p>
<p>The Mana Fortress is quite an intricate place, but it&#39;s a hive made up of the top-tier monsters! Lucky most of them aren&#39;t very tough on us, just frustratingly evasive, or they spawn more troops...</p>
<p>Let&#39;s hope this is the last corridor beyond here...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/o5MWLwG.png alt="last corridor?" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>No, it isn&#39;t, as there are an Armored Man, a Dark Knight, and a Terminator!</p>
<p>We&#39;re getting lots of treasures in this place, but no weapon orbs so far...</p>
<p>The Master Ninja is an exceptionally tough one, as he finishes Pidge off in <strong>two hits!!</strong></p>
<p>The Terminator&#39;s not a fan of darkness...and he&#39;s strong against dragon weapons! Or at least, he&#39;s strong against Hero&#39;s attacks!</p>
<p>We come to my worst nightmare...three Master Ninjas in one room!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/pxzsYL5.png alt="three ninja masters" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I try to escape after some combat, but it&#39;s game over for us...</p>

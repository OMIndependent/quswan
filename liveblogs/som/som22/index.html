<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>In the palace now, where I&#39;m having a hard time beating these Goblins! They tangle Hero up as well!</p>
<p>I also find out that I can use Cure Water on the entire party!</p>
<p>I switch control to Pidge and cast the spell!</p>
<p>It takes awhile, but the Goblins eventually get taken care of...</p>
<p>Now for the next set of Goblins in the center hall...if they couldn&#39;t heal themselves and weren&#39;t so quick in their attacks, we would&#39;ve taken care of them already!</p>
<p>That&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve seen a moving chess piece as an enemy here...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/EWY620b.png alt="chess knight" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>But the <strong>Chess Knight</strong> can sneakily dodge away most of our attacks. They’re also taken care of.</p>
<p>After fighting a horde of Goblins and a few monsters, I&#39;m back at the same place where we lost our lives...</p>
<p>I have to remember to attack the Goblin first, not the Ma Goblins, as he can heal them!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We climb stairs to the third floor of the palace, where more Goblins keep us busy!</p>
<p>Crossing to another room, where a Goblin sleeps, but wakes up immediately!</p>
<p>Lucky we stop the Goblin from spawning Ma Goblins...</p>
<p>Next, two quick Chess Knights...</p>
<p>...and we cross into the door forward!</p>
<p>In the hall, a Goblin sees us, and I see more stairs leading up...we escape the Goblins...</p>
<p>We&#39;re now at the fifth and top floor of the Underground Palace, where we hear a voice...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/gnkGU5V.png alt="stage is set" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>And a gnome pops out! He&#39;s not very happy that we came barging into the palace!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/LnD8mk1.png alt="no barging here" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Max starts insulting the gnome, the gnome throws back an adultist insult at Max, and a fight ensues between them! All that&#39;s missing here is a dust cloud...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/W3fvpW6.png alt="max and gnome fight" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>More shaking and rumbling&#39;s going on again...the gnome runs away!</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Pidge points out someone or something coming from behind the door...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/re5HGWm.png alt="gigas fight" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/wdIyxSVtPek>...and we&#39;re in another dangerous boss battle!</a></p>
<p>The boss we&#39;re facing is a <strong>Fire Gigas!</strong></p>
<p>Since he&#39;s a fire-based monster, I have Max cast Freeze on him!</p>
<p>It&#39;s super-effective!!!</p>
<p>I decide to focus my strategy on spamming the Freeze spell!</p>
<p>The Fire Gigas can also breathe fire too!</p>
<p>He dissipates into small fireballs...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/2WgAS62.png alt="gigas vanish" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Now where is he going to show up next?</p>
<p>He reappears and I have Max cast another Freeze spell, but not before he throws more fire at Pidge!</p>
<p>I use up a Royal Jam on Max, thinking it might recover his magic. It doesn&#39;t. It&#39;s this game&#39;s equivalent of an Elixir...</p>
<p>After pulling another vanishing trick, the Fire Gigas reappears, using a <strong>Lava Wave</strong>, and we get caught in it!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/uPmY072.png alt="lava wave" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Dangit! Pidge is out of MP!</p>
<p>The Gigas turns into fireballs again...I heal Pidge again.</p>
<p>After one more Freeze, the fireworks appear as the giant falls...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Fhv2oxU.png alt="gigas falls" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>...and we get an <strong>Axe&#39;s Orb!</strong></p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Crossing forward, we make it to the Mana Seed chamber!</p>
<p>So the <strong>gnome</strong> is the guardian for this palace&#39;s Mana Seed...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/kDSHK4K.png alt="gnome guardian" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The gnome thanks us for taking care of the Fire Gigas earlier...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/TcLpxzc.png alt="thank you" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>He apologizes to us, saying he used us to take care of the “big oaf.”</p>
<p>Max is not too happy about being used.</p>
<p><strong>Max:</strong> &quot;...Serve <strong>me</strong> and maybe I&#39;ll forgive you! Otherwise, I&#39;ll throw you to my servant Hero!&quot;</p>
<p>The gnome, in fright, pleads and begs with us as he willingly becomes Hero&#39;s servant.</p>
<p>Hero&#39;s not too happy at being called a servant.</p>
<p>The gnome tells us to close our eyes.</p>
<p>Now we can summon the gnome any time in battle!</p>
<p>He casually calls Pidge Hero&#39;s wife. Pidge is not happy with that.</p>
<p>Max likes the gnome&#39;s style.</p>
<p>The look on Pidge&#39;s face is priceless...hee...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/UEfGw8n.png alt="not my husband" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We climb up to the dais where the Mana Seed is held...</p>
<p>This time, the aura from this seed glows golden-yellow...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/6NCvJzQ.png alt="golden glow" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Now let&#39;s see if Max remembers anything...</p>
<p>Max&#39;s head is in pain...he pulls a slightly funny face.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ILAv5An.png alt="max funny face" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Max finally remembers everything, and says where his home is: the <strong>Upper Land Forest!</strong></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/DjcTOQS.png alt="upper land forest" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>He tells us to take him back to his home there. Until then, he&#39;s still in our party!</p>
<p>Before going back, I check on the new spells we received from Gnome. For Max, he gets <strong>Earth Slide</strong>, <strong>Speed Down</strong>, and <strong>Gem Missile</strong>. Pidge gets <strong>Stone Saber</strong> (to imbue the Mana Sword and other weapons with the Earth element), <strong>Defender</strong>, and <strong>Speed Up</strong>.</p>
<p>That...actually ended pretty quickly! I expected puzzles, and a longer trek in the palace, but the short length of this palace surprised me...</p>

<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>I sort of overprepared myself before taking on the Wall Face...</p>
<p>The townsfolk are now back to their former selves!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/jlPeJP7.png alt="townsfolk restored" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>So she might not have been under Thanatos&#39;s control after all...</p>
<p>Inside the castle, there&#39;s now fewer people inside...</p>
<p>One of the guards near the throne tells us the King&#39;s in his bedroom.</p>
<p>The Chancellor didn&#39;t expect Hero to save the day!</p>
<p>The King&#39;s maid tells us that the King&#39;s happy again!</p>
<p>The Queen gives us our thanks and tells us to visit Pandora anytime.</p>
<p>Now we talk to the King...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/G6veD51.png alt="king happy" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>...who congratulates Hero for saving the citizenry!</p>
<p>He mentions that Jema told him about Hero and the Mana Sword, but didn&#39;t believe him. The King, knowing that Hero&#39;s the foretold &quot;knight in the legend,&quot; lets Hero have what&#39;s inside the treasure house.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/p63fzYN.png alt="treasure house" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The guard goes downstairs...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>...and so do we!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/lZUkVao.png alt="treasure house" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>That&#39;s a lot of treasure! I wonder what&#39;s inside?</p>
<p>It&#39;s mostly four helpings of 50 gold pieces, and...another <strong>Sword&#39;s Orb</strong>, and another <strong>Spear&#39;s Orb</strong>, meaning it&#39;s time for another upgrade!</p>
<p>I leave the castle and go to the armor shop here to check their wares.</p>
<p>The only thing new here is a <strong>Cobra Bracelet</strong>...</p>
<p>I buy that and another Power Wrist, sell some unneeded equipment, and we&#39;re off!</p>
<p>We head to the two children&#39;s house, where the parents have been released from Thanatos&#39;s control!</p>
<p>The father vows to protect his family no matter what, and what the mother says here, I also agree with...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/5yIAX5c.png alt="mother response" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Mother:</strong> &quot;For the sake of the children, I don&#39;t want war.&quot;</p>
<p>We visit other houses. The blond man with the awesome kitchen is still denying stuff. One man outside says he felt like he &quot;had a dream.&quot; </p>
<p>The grandma who was also under Thanatos&#39;s trance is back, but it turns out that her granddaughter is Pidge&#39;s friend, Phanna, the blue-haired girl... <img class=emojione alt=ðŸ˜Ÿ title=:worried: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/1f61f.png></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/OpQqX9R.png alt="grandma worry" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>It seems I&#39;ve got four weapons to ask Watts to upgrade now...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/d4Ya55F.png alt="weapons orbs" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We leave town and take a cannon to Gaia&#39;s Navel once more...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Inside Watts&#39;s forge, where I have him start upgrades with the Bow first, which becomes a <strong>Short Bow!</strong></p>
<p>Next, the Spike Knuckle, reforged into the <strong>Power Glove!</strong></p>
<p><img src=http://i2.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/005/634/powerglove_film_still_from_the_wizard.jpg alt="power glove so bad" width=200 height=203.33></p>
<p><del>It&#39;s so bad...</del></p>
<p>Finally, the Broad Sword and Heavy Spear, which cost 400 each to upgrade!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/cvO2TPx.png alt="herald sword" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/fGMXSj5.png alt="sprite spear" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Watts&#39;s handiwork gives us the <strong>Herald Sword</strong>, which looks like a mighty katana, and the <strong>Sprite&#39;s Spear</strong>, a long, blue spear!</p>
<p>The Herald Sword&#39;s a bane for slimes and lizards, while the Sprite&#39;s Spear has a chance of &quot;ballooning&quot; enemies! The &quot;very bad&quot; Power Glove also has a new effect: the wearer can cause extra damage to insects!</p>
<p>After resting, we do more level grinding, and take a cannon to the Water Palace!</p>

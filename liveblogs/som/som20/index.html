<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> I feel like I didn&#39;t praise <a href=https://youtu.be/3dhpIEerwng>this hauntingly beautiful piece enough last time, so here it is again.</a> Honestly, that piece gives me both the chills and makes me tear up internally. It&#39;s that good.</p>
<p>Inside the Water Palace, Luka gives us troubling news concerning an Elemental called <strong>Undine</strong>.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/NPR2Agl.png alt="luka waterfall" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Undine&#39;s seal surrounding the palace is almost weakening, and Luka fears the worst for her...</p>
<p>We head towards the cave behind the waterfall. So that place wasn&#39;t Luka&#39;s hideout, but Undine the Elemental&#39;s.</p>
<p>The water around the waterfall where it was empty before is now overrun with big-eyed fish called <strong>Iffish</strong>.</p>
<p>These Iffish can cause considerable damage if we&#39;re not careful!</p>
<p>After several seconds, the Iffish are down!</p>
<p>Inside the waterfall cave now, where we get more Iffishial welcomes!</p>
<p>In the next cave, Hero reacts in surprise to the egg with a heart marked on it, lying in the middle of the cave. The egg hatches, revealing another creature, a smiling, bouncing <strong>Tonpole!</strong></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/FrBa59w.png alt=tonpole width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>It&#39;s usually the cute ones that are dangerous in this game...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>This Tonpole has either a lot of health, or our weapons are not strong enough!</p>
<p>Now the Tonpole evolves into another creature, a <strong>Biting Lizard</strong>, and the danger music amps up again!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/EjNL0RW.png alt="lizard swallow" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Aaahh, the creature swallowed Hero into his belly whole!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/heZwqg0.png alt="lizard opens mouth" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>If one of the party&#39;s within a straight line distance at the lizard, he swallows Hero or my other allies!</p>
<p>I have Hero keep moving in different places to make sure the lizard doesn&#39;t swallow anyone else...</p>
<p>We eventually corner him with attacks.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/sd6l4Ya.png alt="lizard heals" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Aaaaaahhhh, and he heals himself, with a level 3 Cure spell, no less!</p>
<p>I&#39;m also unable to attack when the lizard starts sticking his big tongue to swallow the ally I&#39;m controlling!</p>
<p>How do we prevent him from healing himself?</p>
<p>I switch to using a Spear, and try to get close, but the lizard&#39;s quick enough to leap out of the way! Back to long range tactics!</p>
<p>The rest of my allies keep on spamming attacks at the lizard...</p>
<p>We eventually corner him again and wear him out for good this time.</p>
<p>Instead of fireworks, the cute lizard slumps down in tired defeat...</p>
<p>We get a <strong>Glove&#39;s Orb!</strong></p>
<p>The lizard vanishes while a tunnel opens, and <a href=https://youtu.be/QA8rdVdoiy0>quiet, yet tense, beautiful music plays...</a></p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We meet Undine!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Yqa8H4t.png alt="undine intro" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>She rewards us by recovering our health, and giving us &quot;2 types of magic!&quot; <strong>Yes!!</strong></p>
<p>Undine gives Pidge her healing and defensive magic, while Max gets her ice and offensive magic!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/C29GIIL.png alt="max dance" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Hero asks if he gets anything.</p>
<p>Undine tells him that his Mana Sword will grow more powerful than any magic spell...</p>
<p>...and tells him that Pidge has the power to turn the Mana Sword into an <strong>Ice Saber</strong>, to freeze enemies with, or, in her words, to turn &quot;them into snowmen!&quot;</p>
<p>Her gift to Hero is another Mana weapon: a <strong>Pole Dart!</strong></p>
<p>She vanishes, leaving us with her magic powers, and the new weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Max:</strong> &quot;<strong>No one can stop me now!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Back at the cave entrance, where unIffishial guests are swimming about, I prepare to do a demo of Undine&#39;s powers...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/RWf1OpB.png alt="undine ring menu" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Pidge can use <strong>Cure Water</strong>, <strong>Remedy</strong>, and <strong>Ice Saber</strong>, while Max has <strong>Energy Absorb</strong>, <strong>Freeze</strong>, and <strong>Acid Storm</strong>...</p>
<p>I have Max cast Freeze on the swimming Iffish twice. The spell fires icy hail...</p>
<p>I also have Pidge demonstrate her new healing magic...</p>
<p>Max is right, no one can stop us now (so far)!</p>

<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>I proceed, trudging through the snowy, crystalline forest.</p>
<p>I have Pidge demonstrate her new powers from Salamando with a Blaze Wall!</p>
<p>The nearby Shellblast is surrounded by flames!</p>
<p>I also test a Fireball on an unreachable Shellblast...</p>
<p>The turtle also has water magic handy as it heals itself!</p>
<p>I go around the forest...where I&#39;m surrounded!</p>
<p>I then demo Max&#39;s other fire spells on two Shellblasts!</p>
<p>I go to the nearby north passage...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/DVXQwat.png alt="north passage" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>...where two Howler wolves and a Shellblast push us back!</p>
<p>I demo the rest of Pidge&#39;s spells on the enemies here...</p>
<p>Forward now...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>...Into a large castle of sorts! This must be the <strong>Ice Palace</strong>.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/GGrb4YH.png alt="ice palace entrance" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I take care of the monsters at the front by chaining Pidge and Max&#39;s magic...</p>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/vN5eMiST1i8>Here&#39;s the music for the Ice Palace.</a> The drums make the tune different from other ice-themed music...</p>
<p>These Shellblasts in the entrance hall are quick!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/TbqzEcb.png alt="entrance hall" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Seeing a nearby switch pad, I press it, pulling the walls apart!</p>
<p>But they push back into place once I let go!</p>
<p>I head to the west and east rooms and press their switchpads...the west one makes a fail sound.</p>
<p>The east one takes out the wall before it, leaving us to go up the stairs forward!</p>
<p>We encounter another slime monster, a <strong>Blue Drop!</strong></p>
<p>It takes a spamming of fire and weapons to take care of them...</p>
<p>We&#39;re now before a set of two staircases...</p>
<p>...and more enemies come!</p>
<p>Into the west door...</p>
<p>...where there&#39;s a switchpad and a Blue Drop guarding it!</p>
<p>These enemies are really quick to dodge the sword, so I change Hero&#39;s weapon to the whip.</p>
<p>With some magic and determination, we beat it and press the switch, opening a bridge forward!</p>
<p>What&#39;s beyond the west door?</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Three <strong>Specter</strong>s and two switchpads!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/OsCSflU.png alt="specter and switches" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>When I accidentally left the room and came back, it seems I glitched the game somewhat. The room looks brighter...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/jZ11H4O.png alt="bright glitch" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Pressing the east switchpad reveals another door forward!</p>
<p>Now who&#39;s this enemy?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/5pysLkk.png alt="enemy floating" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Seeing a staircase ahead, I ignore him.</p>
<p>Upstairs now, where we encounter our first book monster: a <strong>Mystic Book!</strong> It seems like <strong>Wild Arms</strong> and <strong>Symphony of the Night</strong> might have gotten their inspiration for their floating book monsters from this game!</p>
<p>Come on, hit! Why are our attacks missing?!</p>
<p>Oh no, now it&#39;s casting something!</p>
<p>Max&#39;s Boomerang stops it for good, though.</p>
<p>Then a Specter and another Mystic Book jump in!</p>
<p>The Mystic Book casts a barrier around itself! It seems to dislike Undine&#39;s magic...</p>
<p>Is this place a hall for books of sorts?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/0W5DNIl.png alt="library maze" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Worse, it&#39;s a maze...</p>
<p>Even worse, we&#39;re out of Walnuts...</p>
<p>At the end of the maze, we find another monster, a <strong>Weepy Eye!</strong> That&#39;s the same one we saw before we went up to the second floor of this palace!</p>
<p>Into another door at the end of the hall...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/u3Ino9R.png alt=trapped width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>...and the bookshelves close, trapping us in the room!</p>
<p>We fight off the three Mystic Books here with Max&#39;s magic!</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>After they&#39;re gone, I push on the west switchpad...</p>
<p>...which opens a hole beneath us, dropping us down into...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/vCNblbg.png alt="a trio of tonpoles" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog>
A trio of Tonpoles! Oh no... :(</p>
<p>Their defense is rock solid, as usual!</p>
<p>But we&#39;ve learned a lot more magic since the last time we fought one of these guys!</p>
<p>I spend the last of Max&#39;s magic here...</p>
<p>...and they gradually evolve into Biting Lizards!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/1GCBVIH.png alt="biting lizards three" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog>
They don&#39;t waste time, swallowing most of the party whole!</p>
<p>At least we can attack them more easily.</p>
<p>Whenever they walk around with their mouths flapping, that&#39;s a sign that they&#39;re hungry and want to swallow one of us...</p>
<p>They can also heal themselves like before!</p>
<p>We decide to focus our attacks on one, and only target others if one of our allies have been swallowed...</p>
<p>Seems like we got one now!</p>
<p>Down goes the second one!</p>
<p>Sorry, cute lizard...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/9OunSdA.png alt="last lizard" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog>
I have Hero finish him off...</p>
<p>Keep casting your healing magic, you can&#39;t stop me!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/qmtpOfZ.png alt="lizard fall" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Afterwards, we&#39;re back in the library!</p>
<p>There&#39;s now a tunnel up ahead...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/REr6OmK.png alt="tunnel ahead" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>But I go back. I use the Magic Rope to try to get out of the palace, but no go!</p>
<p>After a long relentless struggle with enemies, we make it back to Neko in the snowfield! He really doesn&#39;t like the cold...</p>
<p>We buy more stuff, recover, buy even more Walnuts, and save here!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/OQ6va20.png alt="neko shopping" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I equip a new Golden Vest for Pidge and resave my progress.</p>

<p>Here I go! I&#39;m now nervous of what the rest of the village thinks of us after Giles&#39;s...assumptions!</p>
<p>Bergus and Nestus want to go to the beach since the tide is low.</p>
<p>Talis wants proof of Alundra&#39;s &quot;demonry&quot; by asking him to stick out his tongue to see if it&#39;s forked.</p>
<p>Beaumont thinks the low tide is not a good sign, and Thyea&#39;s well aware of our situation.</p>
<p>Meade thinks that Giles is confused. There was definitely no confusion when said we were cursing the village!</p>
<p>Grandpa Wendell mentions his grandpa saw another shrine under the sea. Now that the tide&#39;s low, we can check it out.</p>
<p>Kisha thinks we had nothing to do with what&#39;s happening and apologizes for her brother&#39;s judgments. Phew!</p>
<p>Naomi also supports us too, and I use a Magic Elixyr, get a new one, and a few herbs.</p>
<p><strong>Yuri:</strong> &quot;My nephews went foraging for herbs in the desert, and all I got was a lousy t-shirt.&quot;</p>
<p>Gustav believes Giles&#39;s assumptions. Elene also thinks Alundra is a god of death as well.</p>
<p>Kline does not believe Giles, thank goodness. Though Giles says he received the message that Alundra is the devil from the gods themselves. Hmmm...</p>
<p>Myra, on the other hand, is still pissed and grieving over Naomi&#39;s death that she calls Alundra a devil and a murderer. <img class=emojione alt=â˜¹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Bonaire thinks I owe Giles money.</p>
<p>Grandpa Phineas also mentions the low tide.</p>
<p>Lutas doesn&#39;t believe Giles, Fein hasn&#39;t slept for two days because of the nightmares...</p>
<p>Septimus doesn&#39;t believe Giles at all, as expected from him!</p>
<p>Sierra thinks a loved one&#39;s betrayal is the most heartbreaking thing ever.</p>
<p>Sybill predicts worse things ahead in the future, as her dreams become more vivid and terrifying...</p>
<p>I leave for the beach.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>How strange, the water hasn&#39;t receded at all the last time I came here, and I can&#39;t cross the ocean.</p>
<p>I go into Nava&#39;s Cabin, nothing&#39;s changed.</p>
<p>I go back and go to Yustel, who sees a fearsome force staring down from the well of darkness. I ask for more help by offering money and she says someone waits for me in a seaside cave, the cave I went to before. I head back to the Coastal Cave immediately.</p>
<p>After finding a stray rock and throwing it near the square block back in the chamber I got stuck on, I use it as a jumping stone and proceed deeper into the Coastal Cave.</p>

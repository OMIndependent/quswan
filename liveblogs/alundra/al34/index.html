<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSv5x-6OWVY">The music here is a mishmash of instruments, some organ, some string, some flute.</a></p>
<p>I swim to shallower waters in the east.</p>
<p>There are wooden docks, and three moving platforms on different levels, with the faster being on the lowest one.</p>
<p>I swim to the south end and find a chest with a Strength Tonic inside.</p>
<p>I jump on the short platform as I wait before it lands near land. I cross around the cavern behind the waterfalls, southwards, and east, until I see two statues flanking a waterfall.</p>
<p>The one on the right comes to life and tries to attack me! The left one also joins the fray!</p>
<p>I beat them with a charge attack!</p>
<p>I head back to the water and jump to the highest moving platform to reach a chest of herbs, and a lever switch.</p>
<p>Rumbling happens after I move the switch to the right.</p>
<p>I jump on the middle platform to head to the dock where three lizard statues are.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a set of stairs and some rubble at that point. I blow up the rubble, revealing a passage.</p>
<p>I take the passage first. Inside is a chest containing herbs, and more water with blue slimes.</p>
<p>The blue slimes can also float on deep water! There&#39;s a huge fleet of them!</p>
<p>I land on the shallows, where I take care of most of them!</p>
<p>While taking care of them, I see a teleporter panel in the south part of the cave.</p>
<p>I grab the herbs from the chest and climb the rope ladder up and find another passage upwards, which leads me back to the surface!</p>
<p>I jump back into the hole, and head to the teleporter.</p>
<p>The place I&#39;m now in is more cave, with a triangle panel that restores my health!</p>
<p>On my right, I see more lizard statues and a glimpse of a huge lizard statue!</p>
<p>I head further where I see two treasure chests fenced off on my left.</p>
<p>I teleport back, exit the slime cave, and head to the south staircase down, where more lizardpeople await.</p>
<p>After taking care of them, I see small square blocks, which I break, with more greenery to cut.</p>
<p>I move east, where three statues block the way, and come to life!</p>
<p>At least this dungeon has more action than the previous ones!</p>
<p>After awakening the third lizard and take care of him, I proceed.</p>
<p>But the staircase past the statue blocks is closed.</p>
<p>The door forward in the western part of the cave is now open.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Yikes! Spikes! On the floor!</p>
<p>I check their pattern before jumping over their holes!</p>
<p>I move to the water, where there&#39;s a rock on a wooden dock. I take the rock, but drop it on my way to the gap.</p>
<p>There&#39;s also huge spiked balls in the water...</p>
<p>After a few tries, I head back up and try to get the chests in that area. No luck.</p>
<p>I go to the guide, to find the purpose of that rock. I realize I have to use that rock to hit the lever.</p>
<p>Bam! I hit the switch, opening the staircase to the east, I bet.</p>
<p>A wooden winding staircase! This is probably the first I&#39;ve encountered these things in the game.</p>
<p>I&#39;m now in a room full of lizard statues and symbolic looking panels.</p>
<p>Four more lizardpeople, and a lizard spear thrower await!</p>
<p>I pull the lever switch behind the five statues, where one of them had the lizard spear guy, opening the stairways.</p>
<p>Heading northeast to another chamber, and hitting square blocks as stepping stones, I come to a dead end, where three chief lizardpeople are there! They glow green instead of gold this when they come to life!</p>
<p>Wait, did one of them spit out slime?</p>
<p>I take care of two of them, and two more jump out of their statues!</p>
<p>This keeps on going, and this is the first time I use my water magic to get two of them!</p>
<p>The fights still keep on going until I use my bow to break one of the statues to stop their regenerating! It feels like <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauntlet_(1985_video_game)>Gauntlet</a> now!</p>
<p>I break the remaining two statues with the sword and take care of the lizardpeople.</p>
<p>A wall explodes and those fireball spitting bird statues are back!</p>
<p>I pass them and head upstairs, where more statues greet me, and it&#39;s the infinite spawning ones!</p>
<p>I break them and take care of the rest. Now I&#39;m out of herbs!</p>
<p>I open the chest, which has one set of herbs, and finish off the last lizardperson.</p>
<p>On the south end, I see more small square blocks, and a chest on a tall ledge.</p>
<p>With careful jumping skills, I get a key.</p>
<p>I tail back to the first area, east of the statues flanking the waterfall, and unlock the iron gate with the key. I jump down to reach a chest on an island with another Strength Tonic that I can&#39;t carry since I&#39;ve got one. I wish this game can let me carry three...</p>
<p>Now I go around again and head downstairs.</p>
<p>At the base of the staircase, there&#39;s more herbs in a chest!</p>
<p>There&#39;s now four lizard statues flanking the hall and a huge set of pillars south of them! Some pillars break from the flail, others don&#39;t!</p>
<p>An island west of the pillars are visible, with several lizard statues flanking the way.</p>
<p>One of them is an infinite spawning statue! No, make that two!</p>
<p>After taking care of that, I head downstairs.</p>
<p>There&#39;s now lizard statues forming a circle. I don&#39;t like this at all...</p>
<p>All of them start glowing green...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I realize that I have to hit the statues in a certain order to pass further.</p>
<p>No, I have to hit the statues when they glow green!</p>
<p>I succeed and go further down the Reptile Lair.</p>
<p>Two teleporters await me: one of them glowing purple. I save and recover there.</p>
<p>Now that I think about it, I&#39;m killing off a whole species...I hope this has an effect on the storyline as I go further.</p>
<p>I&#39;m hoping maybe we (or Alundra) get called out in-story for doing this...maybe it won&#39;t...it&#39;ll still be disappointing if that doesn&#39;t happen though...</p>
<p>I head up, where there are two lizard statues, or regenerating statues.</p>
<p>The door forward gives way after taking care of them.</p>
<p>I head back down to the non-glowing teleporter, where I see two more statues.</p>
<p>None of the statues wake up, so I head back upstairs, to the next passage.</p>
<p>The next room is a maze with fireballs that are tracking me!</p>
<p>I pass them and head to the next passage downstairs, where a chest with a Strength Tonic lies. Next to that are a few infinite spawning statues.</p>
<p>I head down, and up, to a bridge. On the other side are <strong>more</strong> lizard statues!</p>
<p>Four of them come to life!</p>
<p>Oh I see, if I press on the triangle in the middle of four statues, they wake up!</p>
<p>I jump on one of the pedestals to head to a cliff, drop down from that cliff, and cross a bridge where I find a chest with a Life Vessel!!!</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>South of the chest is a lever, which I hit promptly, where a moving platform appears between two flanking lizard statues.</p>
<p>Upstairs are more lizard statues, and a switch on a high ledge!</p>
<p>I press the switch, making another switch appear!</p>
<p>After doubling back, I jump on the second switch, opening the gate east!</p>
<p>I&#39;m now in a room with eight lizard statues and square blocks!</p>
<p>After breaking the blocks and triggering a switch, all of them awaken!</p>
<p>The passage southwards is now open after taking care of the hateful eight!</p>
<p>Now I&#39;m in a hall flanked by lizard statues, with all of them coming to life!</p>
<p>The water magic also restores my health too!</p>
<p><strong>Ai yaaaaa!!!</strong> This last lizard guy won&#39;t hold still!</p>
<p>The staircase down finally opens!</p>
<p>Oh noooo, an infinite spawning statue! Three infinite spawning statues, actually. I take care of them, where another stairway opens.</p>
<p>Because I broke some square blocks, I try again, as I fight more lizards off!</p>
<p>I finally head down, where I&#39;m greeted by more lizards! I then go west, where a huge chasm of spikes are below.</p>
<p>Carefully, I go around them and hit a lever, revealing more moving platforms!</p>
<p>Another lever switch is there as well. After failing to hit it with the sword, I throw a bomb at it. That fails too. So I pull out the bow...also no luck.</p>
<p>I fall down the spikes and decide just to rest at this point.</p>
<p>Lucky there&#39;s a small platform between two lizard statues on the way so I can head back anytime without doing all of those battles again!</p>
<p>I take the Tonic from the chest at the entrance and head back to the surface to get more recovery stuff! Using the portals, I go to Lurvy&#39;s this time.</p>
<p>Now it&#39;s back to the lair and to the save portal and that&#39;s that!</p>

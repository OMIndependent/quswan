<p>I go back to the main hall and head to the western room, where I notice a room with a fireball-throwing statues and a chest full of herbs.</p>
<p>I take the goods and finally speak to the skeleton before the throne.</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Releaser, follow the path of true righteousness and you shall not be left wanting!</strong>&quot; He explodes into dust, and the throne descends, and I jump down...</p>
<p>Oh my god! There&#39;s a lot of spikes in this chamber!</p>
<p>A platform moving clockwise and four levers are the only things that are not spikes here.</p>
<p>To the east there&#39;s a big block in the way. I pull, or use the flail to hit the four switches, but they were too low. I use the bombs to pull them, and the block lifts to reveal a passage forward.</p>
<p>More coarse, rough, irritating sand in the next room!</p>
<p>I press the switch in the center of the room, only to reveal more worms!</p>
<p>After the worms were finished, I move forward.</p>
<p>Now this room is filled with mummy giants and a stone-on-tile puzzle again! Except this puzzle is different, as the floor panels are now flashing different symbols!</p>
<p>With some care, I oust the mummy giants!</p>
<p>With extra care, I look at the patterns carefully before throwing the stone on its tile.</p>
<p>The block vanishes, revealing a set of stairs going down.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>When will this dungeon end?</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;m now in a room of more spikes and mummy giants!</p>
<p>I move counter-clockwise and read a sign, saying, &quot;<strong>The great sun&#39;s gaze is held fast by his shimmering reflection in the water. Turning away with regret, he casts a glance upward at the starry sky, where brother moon resides.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>After taking care of the last mummy giant, the four stones drop!</p>
<p>There&#39;s a certain order to placing these stones...</p>
<p>I finally got it, after a bit more guide help! I found out that the stones need to be stacked on top of each other in this order: <strong>teardrop</strong>, <strong>sun</strong>, <strong>moon</strong>, and <strong>star</strong>. This puzzle is not a good one, imo.</p>
<p>I&#39;m now in a chamber full of sand with a hole ahead of me, and a part of mummy golem buried in sand at the center of the room.</p>
<p>The west door&#39;s locked! Time for another boss battle! I recover with an herb and speak to the golem...except nothing happens!</p>
<p>I fall down one of the holes.</p>
<p>More stone-on-tile puzzles again!</p>
<p>After completing the puzzle, more shaking&#39;s going on...</p>
<p>I warp out of the chamber, and fall into the east hole. The west hole is now buried in sand.</p>
<p>The same puzzle again, only this time, the cardinal directions (north, south, east, and west) are reversed! </p>
<p>I do the same thing like in the first hole now!</p>
<p>The sand level has now sunk and I can now speak to the golem!</p>
<p>Now the real boss battle begins!</p>
<p>The battle feels a bit easier than last time though!</p>
<p>I defeated the <strong>Shrine Protector!</strong></p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>

<p>Aaaaaaaaaaaahahhhfhfhshdgksdghjkslhjgshlkghjg;klasl;riwuruhgjbanvkq34jfwdiogiohwjkvashdjakaksdgjksdhgskhjdghjksg! <strong>More puzzles!!!</strong></p>
<p>It&#39;s the same puzzle with four crevices, a lever, and four press switches this time! After using two barrels to hit two switches, I press the third and fourth ones at the same time by accident!</p>
<p>I go forward, where a maze awaits me!</p>
<p>I head downstairs where more mummy giants await!</p>
<p>After taking out my frustrations of these endless puzzles on the mummy giants, I head back up and go through the maze. There are switches which lift the blocks in the maze temporarily, as well as huge holes. Hmmmm, I wonder why they&#39;re there?</p>
<p>After pressing the fifth switch (and after calming down a bit), the block leading to the next room lifts.</p>
<p>I see a lot of people kneeling in prayer.</p>
<p>There&#39;s now a king in front of a throne, waiting for me.</p>
<p><strong>King:</strong> &quot;You have proven your courage in coming here, Releaser. Courage alone shall not end in salvation. You must also be a strong warrior. You shall face a test of strength, Releaser. I pray that you are strong enough to succeed!&quot;</p>
<p>The king lifts his wand and the prayer people turn into mummy giants!</p>
<p>I beat the mummy giants, then a flash of white...</p>
<p>The king turns back into a skeleton, and considers me worthy of this power, and vanishes.</p>
<p>Three treasures drop as prizes!</p>
<p>I get some <strong>Long Boots</strong>, which helps me walk in sand easier!</p>
<p>The left chest has a <strong>Sword</strong> which has a charge option! Since this was a Zelda clone, and since this game was released a year before <em>Ocarina of Time</em> came out, doesn&#39;t that mean Nintendo borrowed this sword-charging feature? Or did this game borrow it from Zelda?</p>
<p>The rightmost chest has another Life Vessel!!! My health is now maxed at 17!!</p>
<p>I head east to a corridor where I use the teleporter, warping me back to the desert!</p>

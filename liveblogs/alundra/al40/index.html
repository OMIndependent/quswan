<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzzuWzej1rk">Here&#39;s the music for Magyscar. It&#39;s the same music every time a cave is visited.</a></p>
<p>The tall grass in the cave looks brown and weird looking.</p>
<p>Ahead, more of those bug mudmen again!</p>
<p>I jump ahead and am blocked by a bed of thorns. Seeing a torch, I carry it around the chasm of spikes and injure myself on one of the thornbeds, but the torch burns them down anyway!</p>
<p>I proceed east, where I take care of more bug mudmen.</p>
<p>A save warp is also further in at the bottom of the canyon!</p>
<p>After recovering my health and saving, I jump on the stones east carefully avoiding the spikes below, and shoot an arrow north at the lever switch.</p>
<p>A ladder unravels as I climb and make my way to another teleporter.</p>
<p>I&#39;m now in a cave of shallow water, with droplets of water dropping above, and corpse flowers (?) and slimes!</p>
<p>I make my way to the next chamber, where bug mudmen halt my progress. I also pick up a chest full of money along the way.</p>
<p>I head to another path and grab more money from another chest!</p>
<p>I take care of the flower corpse spawner thing, and head east, where another chest lies, containing a Strength Tonic.</p>
<p>After heading back to the first area and taking care of the enemy spawners, I use the teleporter to warp back.</p>
<p>I check the passage at the bottom past the spike bed, it&#39;s sealed.</p>
<p>I carry a torch to a bed of thorns southward, and I accidentally get singed!</p>
<p>The next passage has an odd looking platform. I press right, moving the platform right, and so on.</p>
<p>I cross the spikebed and pass three spiked balls.</p>
<p>Ouch! I fall for another spike trap at the top of the ledge.</p>
<p>In the next tunnel, I take care of another bug mudman and burn the thorns near the ladder.</p>
<p>I use the barrels in the room as stepping stones to press the switch, lifting the tiny spiked balls. Dashing past them, I grab the key inside the chest, head back, and use it to open the east gate back at the canyon.</p>

<hr>
<p>In the next room, I see more bug mudmen and an enemy spawner on the other side of the spikebed.</p>
<p>North of where I&#39;m at, a chest is surrounded by numerous beds of thorns!</p>
<p>I spam the arrows at the two bug mudmen standing on a small island with the enemy spawner!</p>
<p>Bombs and fire magic, with damage taken from the spikes, took care of the enemy spawner. A lever drops down as my prize!</p>
<p>There are two sets of torches on the cliff ahead of me, and a passage forward east.</p>
<p>Taking what&#39;s in the chest from the thorns is going to take a lot of thinking here...</p>
<p>With good timing I manage to use two bombs to move the lever right then left, while carrying one of the torches to the bed of thorns, and getting another Gilded Falcon!</p>
<p>I survey the next three areas forward.</p>
<p>After jumping onto a platform and heading south, I&#39;m now in an area with more shrubbery and thorns, with a chest on the left cliff, and torches here. </p>
<p>With drips of water from the cavern&#39;s ceiling, I carefully carry the torch to burn the thorns covering a chest with a key inside.</p>
<p>In the next room, more huge spiked balls rotate around, and I get a chest of herbs from the ledge above!</p>
<p>The spawners in the next room spit out fast crawling spiders!</p>
<p>They&#39;re also great leapers, making them more terrifying! They also shoot stingers from long range!</p>
<p>Fed up, I use the bow to pick them off.</p>
<p>I press the switch in the northern part of the shallows, lifting the spiked balls in the east! I count how long it takes before they fall down again, around three seconds, and cross over.</p>
<p>I take care of more bug mudmen, where the platforms drop after their demise!</p>
<p>I use the key to cross forward, and I&#39;m in a room with more thorns with rock turtles again!</p>
<p>I bait them to use their fiery breath to burn the thorns, press the switch, and defeat them to press onwards!</p>
<p>More bug mudmen, and two thorned up ways to teleporters, with one torch. Which one, which one?</p>
<p>I choose the left one, where I pick up another torch near the warp pad, and burn the second bush.</p>
<p>Now I get interrupted here. I&#39;ll be right back!</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I choose the left teleporter to warp to, which is the way forward into the next chamber. The right teleporter goes to a chest containing more money.</p>
<p>Warping again, I&#39;m now at the top of a ledge in the area where the left teleporter took me.</p>
<p>I proceed by going down from the ledge onto the odd looking platform, and avoiding the spiked balls to get a chest with a key inside.</p>
<p>I head two rooms back to the spider spawners (<strong>*shudders*</strong>) area and use the key to open the door there.</p>
<p>I&#39;m now in a room full of herb plants and a chest in the middle. The chest also has a key.</p>
<p>If my herb stock is full, the herbs automatically heal me!</p>
<p>I head three rooms back (counting the herb and key chest room), take care of a few bug mudmen, jump on the moving platform, and use a barrel to press a switch.</p>
<p>Three torches drop down!</p>
<p>I use them to burn any remaining sharp thorns and move forward!</p>
<p>Spiked balls dropping on high ledges, bug mudmen, and a huge bed of thorns on some of the ledges await in the next room!</p>
<p><strong>When will this dungeon end?</strong></p>
<p>This game&#39;s getting harder by the minute here!</p>
<p>After many failed tries, I head back to the canyon and warp to the save area and recover.</p>

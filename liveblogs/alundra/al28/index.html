<p>I reread the guide, and on the section after the Ancient Shrine (hopefully, I avoided spoilers there!) I found out what those stone arches do, but I have to turn them &quot;on.&quot; I just hope it doesn&#39;t take too long...</p>
<p>The Desert Shrine, or the Sluice Gate area where I used the Sluice Key is the key to making that possible, so I head back there.</p>
<p>Unlike in the Zelda games, I think, the sword can be charged while moving!</p>
<p>Even though I have Merman Boots, the effects of the Long Boots still work!</p>
<p>I plant a bomb in the left lever, and as it explodes, I hit the right lever.</p>
<p>More rumbling&#39;s going on as the sluice gate starts opening...</p>
<p>The gate drains the water that is past the walls of the sluice shrine, giving me access to the lower ground outside, where an opening lies.</p>
<p>I go in, where a hall of kneeling statues are on each side. I proceed further.</p>
<p>The place I&#39;m at now is surrounded by greenery, a temple like ruin of sorts. In the middle of the room, I see decorated floor panels laid out like this:</p>
<p>......<strong>X</strong>......<br> 
.....<strong>X X</strong>....<br>
...<strong>X X X</strong>...<br>
.....<strong>X X</strong>....<br>
......<strong>X</strong>......<br></p>
<p>The floor panels have an engraved symbol sort of like the Triforce...</p>

<p>A man appears encased inside a crystal...</p>
<p>&quot;I am Berue. My wait for your arrival has spanned more than a millenium, Releaser. I will show you five Signs that bind this world.&quot;</p>
<p>The Sign of <strong>Harmony</strong>...the Sign of <strong>Trust</strong>...the Sign of <strong>Wisdom</strong>...the Sign of <strong>Love</strong>...and The Sign of <strong>Courage</strong>...</p>
<p>What I did is basically a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)>Simon</a> game five times, with the last two signs, Love and Courage, being the hardest since the lights came on so fast!</p>
<p><strong>Berue:</strong> &quot;I have witnessed all the signs of a true Releaser. Now I shall open the Gate which we crafted for you. Stand between the pillars to enter the portal of warped time and space, Releaser!&quot;</p>
<p>The panels have now vanished along with Berue!</p>
<p>I go north to the area outside Nirude&#39;s Lair, where a stone arch has a blue-white light portal in between...I step in.</p>
<p><strong>*portal whoosh*</strong></p>

<hr>
<p>I&#39;m now in this place...</p>
<p><img src=http://vgmaps.com/Atlas/PSX/Alundra-MegalithPortalChamber.png alt="portal chamber" width=404 height=337></p>
<p>The floating blue diary south of the gray crystal&#39;s dais is the save diary. I save and exit back out.</p>
<p><strong>*exit portal whoosh*</strong></p>
<p>I explore around the map, activating the rest of the stone arches that I saw by going in them...</p>
<p>On the way to the Cliffs, I swim to an island and open a chest, containing a Life Vessel!!!</p>
<p>My health is now maxed out to 20!!!</p>
<p>I fall down the waterfall, and swim west. I climb the cliffs near the waterfall, finding two chests: a Strength Tonic, and a Gilded Falcon.</p>
<p>I go to Lurvy&#39;s to get more recovery stuff: herbs, a Magic Elixyr, and a Wonder Essence.</p>
<p>The portals I&#39;ve activated so far are:</p>
<p>--Near the Watermill<br>
--The Cliffs near Lurvy&#39;s Shack<br>
--Near the Pond with the Whirlpools<br>
--Near the Marsh<br></p>

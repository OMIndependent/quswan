<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNv9BmLn8Mk">Here&#39;s the music for the Coastal Cave.</a></p>
<p>The next chamber has two moving platforms and a huge chasm below!</p>
<p>I jump on the platforms and make it to the other side, where an orc and a lever await.</p>
<p>I activate the lever, revealing two platforms past another chasm. However, I miss my jump and fall down...</p>
<p>Water, mudmen, and rock turtles await my presence there. The mudmen are easy to beat, but they spit out harmful mud!</p>
<p>There&#39;s a locked door north, and a platform in the southeast part of the room. I head back up using that platform.</p>
<p>I eventually make it to the other side, where there are more orcs and a vertical lever switch. I push it down, opening up another passage in the cave.</p>
<p>There are more square blocks in the way though. At the risk of making it to the next passage, I break some of them.</p>
<p>I climb a ladder and hit another lever, revealing three more platforms, and crossing that, another ladder.</p>
<p>A chest awaits for me to take its contents...more herbs!</p>
<p>I fall down the chasm to reset the square blocks.</p>
<p>The vertical lever is still down as I get back! After jumping a few times and taking care of a stubborn orc, I go to the next room.</p>
<p>There&#39;s logs and spikes!</p>
<p>After some painful crossings, I get a key from a chest and turn back.</p>
<p>I drop down to the chasm to unlock the door north.</p>

<hr>
<p>I am now in a chamber with more square blocks. I proceed further into another chamber to see more small square blocks, and spiked balls. After making it past the obstacles to the other end, I see an unfamiliar gray crystal thing. I break the square block underneath it, and hit the crystal with a jar. It now turns gold, probably activating it.</p>
<p>What did that do?</p>
<p>I head back and smash some more square blocks. I&#39;ve opened up three more tunnels northward.</p>
<p>One of them has a huge spiked ball circling around the area. On top of that pillar is one of those crystal diamond switches. I throw a rock at it to turn it on. It turns red.</p>
<p>I head back and go into the next tunnel, where I&#39;m greeted with square blocks in a pit, and more orcs, or orc-like enemies.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a metal pedestal on the floor where three small circles formed into a triangle are embedded on the panel, with a green one as the top circle. This is probably making note of the crystal switches I&#39;ve been hitting.</p>
<p>I go to the eastern tunnel, where four rock turtles and their fiery breath greet me. After beating them, the third crystal switch drops down!</p>
<p>I throw a rock at it, turning it green!</p>
<p>The metal pedestal is now gone, with a staircase leading down in its place.</p>
<p>I&#39;m now in a room with a platform and high ledges, along with a switch on the side ledge wall surrounding the center ledge.</p>
<p>I press the switch, dropping more rock turtles!</p>
<p>Their fire breath pushes me off the ledge and I start the process again!</p>
<p>After taking care of them, another switch drops down. Pressing that summoned three more enemies, mudmen!</p>
<p>Another press switch is my reward. Pressing that one summons three orcs!</p>
<p>The final switch drops, summoning more orcs, walking around the top of the side wall this time!</p>
<p>A chest finally drops down, and I get <strong>Merman Boots!!!</strong></p>
<p>Now I can swim in deep water, ho ho ho!</p>
<p>My first swim is to head to a lone dock in the four tunnel chamber, and grab an item in a chest there, which has herbs!</p>
<p>Mudmen noises sound like someone doing a bad croak of a frog mixed with a deep sounding sea lion.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I go back up to the room with the logs, spikes, and the huge lake.</p>
<p>I swim east to a passage where more mudmen greet me on the shallows!</p>
<p>I climb to solid ground and jump to a high ledge where a shrub-like plant that I can carry is. I drop it while trying to swim back though.</p>
<p>I swim further east to see circling spiked balls in the water, and orcs on land.</p>
<p>Another locked door&#39;s here!</p>
<p>I see more mudmen in the shallow end of the water and a moving platform forward. I toss a nearby barrel to go to the higher ledge and cross over to the other side.</p>
<p>After a few tries, I make the landing!</p>
<p>The next chamber has two rock turtles and more moving spiked balls on the water.</p>
<p>I jump on the crumbling platforms south to reach a chest with a key inside. I get pushed down again by the rock turtle and land on another chest with 30 gilders.</p>
<p>I use more herbs since I keep losing health so fast! These enemies are getting tougher!</p>
<p>I unlock the door forward and am greeted with another orc! Actually, three, no, four orc-like enemies! I hit one with a jar, and head west.</p>
<p>More spiked balls, both big and small, and rising and falling are also hanging around the ledges. This game has a thing for them, no doubt!</p>
<p>I press a switch, causing the big block to rise on the highest ledge.</p>
<p>The unmoving spiked balls drop everytime I&#39;m in their line of fire!</p>
<p>I hear a click, realizing I didn&#39;t make it in time and do the whole course all over again!</p>
<p>I take care of the orcs first out of frustration!</p>
<p>After a few tries, I died, causing me to use up another Wonder Essence!!!</p>
<p>I barely make it!</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>After crushing two rock turtles and more square blocks, I climb and go in another passage.</p>
<p>Circling steel balls again, with orcs!</p>
<p>After getting past the first one, I break some blocks to pick up a stray barrel in the northwest corner. I use it to jump to the higher ledges while getting past more circling steel balls.</p>
<p>The barrel, however, is not high enough for me to reach the ledge!</p>
<p>I smash the one of the balls&#39; center column, destroying their harmful power, and after another few tries, using them with the barrel as jumping stones.</p>
<p>Another lever is in the middle of a bridge in the next chamber, along with two dark brown rocks set in between a closed passage.</p>
<p>I pull the lever...where four more orcs surround me!</p>
<p>I take care of them, and move on! I read a sign mentioning a prison is west of my location. A vertical lever and another passage further to the right is there as well.</p>
<p>I break more blocks south and head into an old prison chamber, iron bars and all, with a teleporter leading to the save point! I go further, but I&#39;m stopped by a locked door.</p>
<p>I save at this point.</p>

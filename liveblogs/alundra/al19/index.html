<p>Now all I have to do here is to move the column to one of the switches while avoiding the spiked balls.</p>
<p>The door north is now open!</p>
<p>I&#39;m now in the next room, where there are wasps from the ceiling, and more sand. Coarse, rough, irritating, everywhere-getting, movement-slowing sand.</p>
<p>The switch to the next room is on top of one of these stone pillars. I jump on the stone pillar near some solid ground, and make my way to the pillar with the switch. However, these wasps are relentless!</p>
<p>After taking care of the wasps, a barrel drops down!</p>
<p>I throw it down and start my jumping.</p>
<p>I try another idea. I carry the barrel and start leaping onto the pillars, and try to throw it on the switch.</p>
<p>After a few tries because I keep falling from the pillars, it works! A moving platform comes down!</p>
<p>The upper chamber contains four crevices and a lever in the center. I pull the lever switch, where barrels and spiked balls drop down.</p>
<p>On the northwest corner, there is also a big platform.</p>
<p>After pulling the lever a certain number of times, only spiked balls drop down.</p>
<p>I use two of the barrels as jumping stones to get to the next platform.</p>
<p>In this chamber, the stone-on-tile puzzle returns with a vengeance! After a while, a buzzer sounds and the stones crumble!</p>
<p>I go upstairs, where the door there is locked!</p>
<p>Going back down, I manage to get three stones in until the buzzer sounds and the sun stone crumbles. I try again...</p>
<p>I did it, and a chest containing a key is the reward!</p>
<p>I make it to the final statue, where he gives me this message: &quot;Behold what the master of the keep speaks!&quot;</p>
<p>He recovers my health and I go back to the main hall, where the skeleton lies.</p>

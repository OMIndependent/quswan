<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C_t3Zi3Gk0">The music for the desert sounds melancholy-like.</a></p>
<p>I figure out that the flail can break square rocks. With this new knowledge, I backtrack to break some square rocks around the map.</p>
<p>I head up to another area I wasn&#39;t supposed to reach yet, and I get attacked by a leafless tree, or a trent, which took 15 hits from my flail to take care of.</p>
<p>I go back to the village and talk to Septimus, who mentions that power without restraint is nothing but a curse. Poor Nadia...</p>
<p>I save at Jess&#39;s house. I&#39;m still a bit confused on using the x or square button to save.</p>
<p>The search for square blocks continues!</p>
<p>The entrance to the coal mine is also caved in by huge boulders, oh well! *<em>sighs</em>*</p>
<p>I go to the upper part of the mine, dash past the three charging spiked balls, and break the small square blocks stacking the switch with the flail and press on said switch.</p>
<p>The gate to the next area opens!</p>
<p>More slimes greet me from the open passage! After taking care of them, the block blocking the stairs upward clears out!</p>
<p>I head upstairs, where an iron gate is blocking my way south and a set of downward stairs east. I go east, where more blue slimes drop like water. And they keep dropping! And dropping! As I take care of a few of them, more drop!</p>
<p>I go back and get the chest from the entrance, which has 30 gilders. Not bad.</p>
<p>I break the square block near the upper entrance of the mine, and head north.</p>
<p>I&#39;m now at a place with trees, more high ledges, and big orc guards, armed with axes. There are several stone pedestals, which state a Crest needs to be put in. Could this be the place where I need to go to face Melzas?</p>
<p>A Diamond Crest, an Agave, a Topaz, a Ruby, a Sapphire, and two more Crests need to be placed, since there are seven Crests to collect. Alundra places the Ruby Crest on top of its stone.</p>
<p>Ah, a Mimic! Those things make me jump!</p>
<p>I go back now and head to the desert.</p>
<p>But not before heading to the area around Tarn&#39;s Manor, breaking the square block there and going around the western part until reaching four chests containing 30 gilders each!</p>
<p>I go around the area again and take care of orcs with maces, finding a strange stone pillar.</p>

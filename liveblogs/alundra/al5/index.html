<p>I select continue and instead of a loading screen, it takes me to a chamber with four small tables, with one of them having a diary on the far left table.</p>
<p>A wizard is also there, who says, &quot;<strong>If your conviction is not firm enough, leave this sacred place at once!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Now I&#39;m back where I left off and I go to Grandpa Wendell&#39;s house and give Septimus the book from the manor.</p>
<p>So Alundra is a Dreamwalker from the Elna Clan, I&#39;m told, and Septimus tells me to enter into Grandpa&#39;s dream. Oh boy...</p>
<p>I say no to try to leave once, but I&#39;m now stuck in a &quot;but thou must&quot; loop. So I say yes, here I go!</p>
<p><strong>*dream whoosh*</strong></p>
<p>Now I&#39;m in Wendell&#39;s Dream and Wendell is surrounded by five slimes!</p>

<p>(<a href=http://vgmaps.com/Atlas/PSX/Alundra-Wendell%27sDream.png>Source</a> for the map)</p>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/EctW7EtfOzg>The music&#39;s creepy as hell!</a></p>
<p>Now I&#39;m a bit stuck since these huge blocks are in the way!</p>
<p>I get some treasure: herbs and another Gilded Falcon.</p>
<p>After figuring out the block movements, I go on ahead to a cliff where I&#39;m surrounded by six slimes! I take care of them, though, and proceed.</p>
<p>There are two bridge paths and I choose the bottom one, but a buzzer sounds and two blocks now block my progress, one per path. After a while, I find out that I have to jump in order to press the switch to make the boxes disappear. I take the top path and go forward, but then two more boxes halt me from going further! Repeat ad nauseum.</p>
<p>I think there&#39;s a pattern when crossing these paths. I got to be careful.</p>
<p>There are bridges connecting the paths, so I use them. I find out that the path is top, bottom, top, bottom, bottom.</p>
<p>I make it to Wendell, and the five slimes that surround him form into a big one! Now that makes the slime an even bigger target!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Now the slime has split into four medium sized ones after some effort.</p>
<p>After getting one, it&#39;s now split into four ordinary ones, yes!</p>
<p>Now I take care of the remaining three medium slimes!</p>
<p>So the slime is called the Gelatinoid and I beat him, yay!</p>
<p>&quot;Thunderation&quot;? Now that&#39;s one interjection I&#39;ll never forget!</p>
<p>And Wendell&#39;s smiling from his bed! I did it!</p>
<p><strong>*exit dream whoosh*</strong> (I like making these sounds!)</p>
<p>One guy, Meade, was creeped out by how we entered Grandpa Wendell&#39;s dream though! It&#39;s amazing, he says, but it&#39;s still creepy.</p>
<p>Outside the house, Giles, the devotee, not the librarian, reports to Chancellor Ronan about the news.</p>
<p>Septimus asks me to come to his house for an explanation about Alundra&#39;s powers.</p>
<p>But Giles asks Alundra to meet with Chancellor Ronan at the Sanctuary.</p>
<p>So I go with Giles to the Sanctuary, the locked church I saw before heading to Tarn&#39;s Manor.</p>

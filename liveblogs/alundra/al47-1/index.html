<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3waeXh2siQ">The music is pretty nice here.</a></p>
<p>I&#39;m greeted by a younger version of Meia, who wants to play tag with me.</p>
<p>We start playing tag, or hide-n-seek.</p>
<p>I survey around the area, these ruins in her dream have an Edenic temple in the sky feel with lots of greenery...</p>
<p>I see a chest and plenty of moving platforms in the west area. In the north are three doors with an image of a sylph on them...</p>
<p>I see Meia, but how do I get up there?</p>
<p>I reach the chest, which contains a Life Vessel!!! Yes!</p>
<p>I reach Meia and she runs off again.</p>
<p>One of the doors up north are open!</p>
<p>I&#39;m now in a place with two levers, two mini platforms, and a statue of a chained Meia on the high ledge.</p>
<p>With a couple of tries, I hit the lever with the flail and head to the low platform quickly. I hit the second lever and move quick.</p>
<p>I jump to the statue and try to bomb it, no go.</p>
<p>I keep hitting the chains on the statue until they&#39;re gone and she comes to life, vanishing from the pedestal.</p>
<p>I head back to the main area. On the southeast, I see a save teleporter and a chest, which has another Gilded Falcon inside.</p>
<p>I save and warp back.</p>
<p>I like this place, it&#39;s so green and beautiful...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>After tons of exploring around the main area, I warp into the pedestal where Meia&#39;s chained statue lay...</p>
<p>I see a huge crowd, with Meia and her mother.</p>
<p>Oh my god, poor Meia! Her father was executed, but she says it was because of his disbelief in the gods.</p>
<p>I head back and see her again. Another passage opens.</p>
<p>I&#39;m now in a place full of water and cracked mini platforms that break once I step on them.</p>
<p>A press switch is on a ledge at the end of the mini platform bridge.</p>
<p>I break the second statue apart, and see another flashback...</p>
<p>I see a library, where Meia&#39;s mother is organizing books...</p>
<p>Meia reassures her mother&#39;s worshipping the gods is alright, but her mother wants to know more about them, her faith becoming an obsession for knowledge...</p>
<p>Time for tag round 3!</p>
<p>I went around the area again, and I counted 7 doors in this dream. Since I saw two flashbacks, thus, we have to visit 5 more flashbacks.</p>
<p>It&#39;s hard to explain this next chamber, but there are torches and thorns and huge, high walls and trees around the place, with a moat surrounding it.</p>
<p>Now another flashback...</p>
<p>No, Meia&#39;s mom! She dug a little too deep and now she&#39;s being burnt at the stake!</p>
<p>Meia warned her that even the gods have secrets, but her mom had to be careful in exposing them...poor Meia. No wonder why she&#39;s a closed book... <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Everytime I see her hiding, Meia always covers her face. Is she crying on the inside?</p>

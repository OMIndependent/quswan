Looks like I&#39;m gonna have to sneak in...</p>
<p>But there&#39;s no way to get through, so no choice but to go back.</p>
<p>Kline and the others greet me, and think the Murgg Woods and the Coal Mine are connected, and that the Murgg have been using tunnels to find the &quot;Crests&quot;.</p>
<p>I explore the area some more...</p>
<p>I find Olen&#39;s house, and I realize I would have been at the Coal Mine sooner had I taken the northern path...</p>
<p>I cut more shrubs to look for more money and enter Olen&#39;s house.</p>
<p>The only thing good from the house was a Gilded Falcon from a chest. I return back to Inoa.</p>
<p>I talk to some kids, where the mayor&#39;s son Talis was like, &quot;I&#39;m not crying, you&#39;re crying,&quot; and the others were not going to think of taking up a mining job. Ever.</p>
<p>Sierra is in the way to Jess&#39;s house, and asks me to go to Sybill.</p>
<p>I try and get a Life Vessel from Naomi&#39;s shop, but it&#39;s worth 500 gilder!</p>
<p>I then go to Yustel and pay her to see where I should go next. I see the map of the whole game from her crystal ball.</p>

<p>(<a href=http://vgmaps.com/Atlas/PSX/Alundra-World(In-GameMap).png>Source</a> for the map)</p>
<p>Kisha is still mourning... :(</p>
<p>Giles is now wishing to petition the gods to bring Olen back to life. I&#39;d sign that petition.</p>
<p>So I find out from Lutas on why Jess is so overprotective of Alundra (and me), his wife and son passed away, and knows death can be a short distance away... :(</p>
<hr>
<p>Kline is preparing for war against the Murgg...</p>
<p>I also learn from Meade about this couple: Gustav and Elene, and their romance, or lack thereof. Elene fell for a miner, leading Gustav into a drunken rage, and hating them both, as seen by the bottles downstairs and the broken furniture upstairs...</p>
<p>Nadia, the girl that explodes something when she sleeps, is pining for Bonaire, the dude that calls us a dude, to notice her instead of &quot;silly waves on the ocean.&quot;</p>
<p>Bonaire talks more about Jess producing more &quot;righteous schwingry&quot; and all that surfer slang. Phineas, his grandfather, thinks getting old sucks, except for senior discounts.</p>
<p>Grandpa Wendell boasts about Kline&#39;s archery skills.</p>
<p>Mayor Beaumont and Thyea talk about how one shouldn&#39;t take life for granted...</p>
<p>I go to Sybill now, and claims that while she&#39;s awake, she lucidly dreams the future. She asks me to take her hand into her dream. I accept.</p>
<p><strong>*dream whoosh*</strong></p>
<p>It&#39;s Kline! What is he doing?</p>
<p>What the...!? Why is he now a werewolf!?</p>
<p>It&#39;s Zazan! With Melzas behind him looking on!</p>
<p>Oh no, it&#39;s one of the villagers caged up in the Murgg&#39;s prisons, and the Murgg are...going into his head?</p>
<p><strong>*exit dream whoosh*</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sybill:</strong> &quot;Soon, Alundra, my dream will become a reality. They all do. That fact frightens me more than anything else. You have to help...<em>please!</em>&quot;</p>
<p>I go back to Jess&#39;s house, where Sierra ships Alundra with Sybill, and leaves. I&#39;m more of a shipper of the blond elf girl I saw at the game&#39;s opening with Alundra though.</p>
<p>Jess asks me to bring flowers to Olen&#39;s Grave in the Cemetery. The flowers smell nice.</p>

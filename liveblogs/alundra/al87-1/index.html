<p>It turns out that I accidentally showed a spoiler in one of the images a few weeks ago, since the dragon in that image was not Wilda, it was the black dragon that I faced off earlier. Whoops!</p>
<p>I&#39;m back at Jess&#39;s house, and I warp back to the Lake Shrine from the well...</p>
<p>I check my items before heading into the main hall...</p>
<p>Melzas warps from his mystical circle, and with the palm of his hand and a flash of light, causes the hall to shake again...</p>
<p>Opening the floor below us once more, and the dragon again!</p>
<p>I fight the dragon with the same tactics as before...hit him as he lands and try to avoid his attacks...</p>
<p>Now that I know the dragon&#39;s tricks from last time, this is going to be slightly easier! But the fight&#39;s still long!</p>
<p>I switch between herbs and <strong>Nava&#39;s Charm</strong> in any case my health gets low!</p>
<p>Now I pull the Ice Wand out!</p>
<p>I switch back to the Holy Sword since it&#39;s a bit more accurate...</p>
<p>Yes, I beat him again!</p>
<p>Now the motivational speeches from the villagers in the Sanctuary...</p>
<p>I get healed again by the villagers and get a new Wonder Essence, not a Life Vessel...</p>
<p>Now let&#39;s see if I can take care of Melzas this time...</p>
<p>I have to remember that when he makes copies of himself, it&#39;s the one that appears last that is the real one!</p>
<p>Realizing from the guide that he hates fire, I equip the Fire Wand!</p>
<p>This is a one-sided fight already!</p>
<p>(In King Theoden&#39;s voice) <strong>Is this it? Is this all you can conjure, Melzas!?</strong></p>
<p>I get caught by his bright proton beam twice so far though!</p>
<p>I got him! He&#39;s now on his knees!</p>
<p><strong>Melzas:</strong> &quot;<strong>Y...you! How dare you seek to humiliate me in my own sanctuary!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Your</strong> sanctuary!? You don&#39;t deserve a sanctuary after what you&#39;ve done!</p>
<p><strong>Melzas:</strong> &quot;<strong>For your defiance, you shall drink of the bitter cup of desolation I have prepared, insolent one!</strong>&quot;</p>

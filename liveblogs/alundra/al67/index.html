<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>As soon as I enter, I get captured by the Murgg!</p>
<p>A Keysmith is also in another cell next to mine. He talks to us. I didn&#39;t catch what he said since I&#39;m typing this now.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yhw3C2ksyek">The music is slightly okay here...</a></p>
<p>After shooting and bombing walls, I notice a crack in the back wall...</p>
<p>After a few bombs I break through!</p>
<p>The next room is a high walled maze! I see a chest southeast, past a wall here but I can&#39;t find a way through!</p>
<p>I make it to the chest, which has a Wonder Essence!</p>
<p>I head northwest and eventually find a chest with more money!</p>
<p>There&#39;s also Murgg that drop down from the walls!</p>
<p>I see another chest from the other side, which has a Strength Tonic! And on the right side of the wall, a Mimic cries out!</p>
<p>After taking care of another Murgg and the Mimic, I see another chest! The chest has herbs.</p>
<p>This maze is very complicated!</p>
<p>I find another Murgg and a Mimic again!</p>
<p>I eventually find a staircase and go up.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I&#39;m now at the base of the Tower of the Great Tree now.</p>
<p>Mmmm, some Murgg are making some soup over a fire. I wonder what they&#39;re cooking...</p>
<p>They spot me, and are shocked at my escape!</p>
<p>After taking care of them, a door creaks to the south.</p>
<p>I carry a stray barrel on my way out.</p>
<p>But there are three fast and big spiked balls here!</p>
<p>I avoid them and escape outside, coming from the right cavity of the tree. I check inside a house, no treasure.</p>
<p>I enter the center of the tree next...</p>
<p>More Murgg wait behind the columns to strike!</p>
<p>Ahead is a &quot;very sturdy door&quot;. I turn back to the prison, trying to get the keysmith out of his jail cell.</p>
<p>I try again, figuring that I missed something, which I did! I didn&#39;t see that the left part of this area was crossable!</p>
<p>I head west to the Murgg&#39;s big cabins!</p>
<p>At one of the cabins, I see recovery triangles and a save diary.</p>
<p>The northwest cabin rooted near the tree is locked tight!</p>
<p>I head to the left cavity of the tree, where a spiked ball on a high ledge circles around counter clockwise, and a chest is situated at the southeast part of the ledge!</p>
<p>The chest has an herb.</p>
<p>Oh god, another spiked ball trap I fell for! Owch!</p>
<p>At the top of another high ledge is a chest on its north end.</p>
<p>I circle around the area to find any passages forward, where the only passage upstairs is blocked!</p>
<p>I open the chest at the ledge, which has...1 gilder! Another trap I have to spring, which unleashes more Murgg and locks the way back!</p>
<p>One claw Murgg, two claw Murgg, three archer Murgg, four boomerang Murgg, and I&#39;m out of the trap!</p>
<p>Five more drop outside the room though!</p>
<p>After beating them, the blocks disappear and I head upstairs!</p>
<p>The second room has a high floor and an unmoving platform on its right!</p>
<p>I go up the steps, seeing a press switch on a platform, and fall down. I head north and hit a lever, opening the gates, moving the platforms in the area, and unleashing more Murgg!</p>
<p>I go up the raised floor and traverse the platforms until I hit the switch!</p>
<p>The switch raises the platform between the gap south of it!</p>
<p>I jump instead of heading down the steps, as there are spiked balls circling the base of the ledge below!</p>
<p>I go north, where the wooden gates shut behind me as more Murgg come out to play!</p>
<p>After taking care of them, I head north again, where a barrel and two jars are below the stairs, and two chests on the other end.</p>
<p>Make that one, as one of them is a Mimic!</p>
<p>No, there&#39;s actually two, since a Mimic was in front the real one. They contain herbs and a Strength Tonic.</p>
<p>I go farther south until I head outside. The view looks pretty nice here!</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Up to the third floor I go!</p>
<p>Hmmm, a spiked ball trap is past the high wall here...</p>
<p>Nope, three Murgg jump down!</p>
<p>The spiked balls can&#39;t move in this hall!</p>
<p>I head east instead of south, where big blocks and more Murgg drop from the ceiling! Why does this happen? Wait, they&#39;re on red alert! That&#39;s why its happening! Every Murgg available is trying to kill me!</p>
<p>The doorway south is on a high ledge as well!</p>
<p>Three chests are on top of separate high walls here! With no chance of getting them, I head out.</p>
<p>I drop down to the second floor deck, following down to a chimney. I&#39;m in the locked cabin now.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a chest here that is locked tight, and a set of stairs down...</p>
<p>So this is the place where they put me, huh? I rescue the Keysmith there.</p>
<p>But they noticed I escape, and they think that I came here to die by their hands.</p>
<p>After taking care of them, I let the Keysmith out!</p>
<p>The Keysmith looks like a sort-of palette swapped Gustav.</p>
<p>The chest upstairs contained the Keysmith&#39;s tools, which he got back. He waits until the Murgg sleep before making a break out. He picks out the cage and leaves!</p>
<p>After recovering and saving here, I head back up the tree...</p>
<p>On the second floor, I notice a chest on the far north! I can&#39;t reach it though!</p>
<p>After reading the guide, I head back to one of the cabins outside where the Keysmith is. I ask him to unlock the sturdy door in the middle.</p>
<p>The Keysmith&#39;s hiding behind the pillar because of the respawning Murgg behind the other pillars.</p>
<p>There ya go Keysmith!</p>
<p>Oh my god, Working Designs, quit with the Ritalin reference joke!</p>
<p>The door opens! He leaves back to his hiding place!</p>
<p>I ride on the elevator, higher and higher I go...</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>More Murgg nearby!</p>
<p>I head to the right, a huge chamber with a four way fireball spout!</p>
<p>In the northeast, I get a chest full of money!</p>
<p>South of there are more infinitely spawning Murgg, and the columns there might have something to do with it!</p>
<p>I try crushing them, no luck!</p>
<p>I push a column upwards, opening the gate west of it!</p>
<p>Another sturdy door, but the keyhole is smaller than the first!</p>
<p>I head back out, on the fifth floor deck, where I survey the place. I get a Gilded Falcon from a chest on the far east part of the deck!</p>
<p>I jump down, where a press switch lies! Pressing it unrolls a ladder to head back up the tree!</p>
<p>I head into the fourth floor hole, where I&#39;m now in a dark room, with more Murgg standing on patrol!</p>
<p>Taking care of them, I jump on the platform, where a set of moving spiked balls halt my progress!</p>
<p>I jump down west of the moving spiked ball room, to land on the third floor!</p>
<p>Now I see why there are spiked balls here!</p>
<p>I make my way back up to the fourth floor and fall down the huge chasm in the first room, where I open the chest on the bottom left ledge containing...1 gilder!</p>
<p>Rinse and repeat!</p>
<p>On the southeast chest, I get a Life Vessel!!! 39 health, whoo!</p>
<p>The middle chest has 30 gilders!</p>
<p>I go back up the fourth floor, pass north of the spiked ball room, and see two more chests on a high wall! Oh my goodness, game! Quit baiting me and give me the treasure!</p>
<p>I head west, where four more Murgg drop by!</p>
<p>Further west in their mess hall, more Murgg with boomerangs are there!</p>
<p>After taking care of them, a stray barrel drops!</p>
<p>I use it as a stepping stone to get to the high wall and grab the lot: 30 gilders and a herb.</p>
<p>On the northeast corner in the mess hall across the staircase is some more rubble! I clear it out and drop down...</p>
<p>...landing in a room with six treasures!</p>
<p>The northwest one is a Mimic! Along with the south one!</p>
<p>I&#39;ll list the treasures here:<br>
NE - Herb<br>
N - 10 gilders<br>
SW - Herb<br>
SE - Strength Tonic</p>
<p>South of this room is a spiked ball in the middle of the high wall and more Murgg!</p>
<p>I survey the room, where there&#39;s a switch at the south end of the high ledge, and more spiked balls!</p>
<p>I press the switch opening the gate eastward!</p>
<p>It seems I&#39;m on the third floor now!</p>
<p>I head outside to the third floor deck, and follow the west end until I see a chest with another Life Vessel!!!</p>
<p>My health is now maxed up to 40!!!</p>
<p>I head in and go up the steps to the fourth floor. After taking care of two Murgg, and opening the gate forward, I jump down off the edge in the next room, and open the chest there, another herb.</p>
<p>I see a switch near a wooden gate, and press it. The gate opens and I take a key from a chest there.</p>
<p>I open the cabin on the deck, where I&#39;m greeted by more Murgg! These guys just keep coming, don&#39;t they!?</p>
<p>After that battle, a chest drops down, containing an Elevator Key!</p>
<p>I save here, exhausted.</p>

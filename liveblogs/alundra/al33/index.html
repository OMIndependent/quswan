<p>Most of the villagers in town seem to have mixed feelings so far about us.</p>
<p>Nestus and Bergus are told to not sleep. The mayor was even inclined to take Chancellor Ronan&#39;s advice and banish Alundra from the village. Thank goodness he didn&#39;t.</p>
<p>Kisha feels as if she&#39;s lost her brother to his fundamentalism. <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy#Conspiracy_theories>She also mentions a certain grassy knoll incident.</a> Oh Working Designs!</p>
<p>Giles wants to see Alundra as &quot;the foul demon that he is,&quot; and will do anything to make that happen.</p>
<p>Rumi considered her husband Meade&#39;s advice to leave Inoa, but where can she go?</p>
<p>Grandpa Wendell thinks there&#39;s a connection between the Murgg and Melzas&#39;s actions. He&#39;s right on the money, but he has no solid proof.</p>
<p>Meade thinks of leaving Inoa...</p>
<p>Yuri warns us to stay away from the swamp, even though we&#39;ve been there before.</p>
<p>Gustav&#39;s still drunk, labeling Inoa as &quot;the village of the damned.&quot; Elene knows who&#39;s going to die next... <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>There are crows on top of Kline&#39;s house...</p>
<p><strong>Meia:</strong> &quot;You don&#39;t have the strength to defeat the evil, Alundra. But I do...just stay out of my way before you kill anyone else with your blatant incompetence.&quot;</p>
<p>Myra has no reason for living anymore, and asks me to end her life so she could join Nadia... <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Phineas tells me to avoid the swamp, Bonaire&#39;s almost &quot;permanently bummed.&quot;</p>
<p>Fein is still in shock at Kline&#39;s passing. Lutas thinks that leaving Inoa is foolish and hopeless.</p>
<p>Septimus found something, in that Inoa is going through the same events that happened a long time ago, when a meteor crashed east of the village. Inside the meteor was an &quot;evil force,&quot; but the book didn&#39;t say when it was even found...or destroyed. Hmmmm...</p>
<p>Naomi says &quot;safety first!&quot; I buy a Strength Tonic.</p>
<p>Sierra had a dream that something terrible was going to happen to Sybill. She can&#39;t even say it...</p>
<p><strong>Sybill:</strong> &quot;You hold the second light in your hands, Alundra.&quot; I wonder what she meant by that? If those words are meant to help us, thank you Sybill.</p>
<p>I go to Kline&#39;s grave, where his tomb reads:</p>
<p><strong>KLINE.<br>
Brave Hunter<br>
Stinky Man</strong></p>
<p>Now that there are three empty plots left, I&#39;m betting that three more people will be gone...I don&#39;t like making this assumption though, and I just hope it&#39;s only three...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>First I recover at Yustel&#39;s, saying that I will encounter a scaly beast...I think this might be in the swamp.</p>
<p>I head for the swamp. With the Long Boots, the marshes don&#39;t slow me down!</p>
<p>I open a chest in the northeast, which has a Strength Tonic.</p>
<p>I find another chest in the southwest part of the marsh, which is another Gilded Falcon.</p>
<p>A third chest I open west of the marsh on a high ledge, which has 30 gilders.</p>
<p>Nice looking lizard statue here.</p>
<p>In the middle of the marsh on a high ledge, there&#39;s a green inflating-deflating thing. I shoot that with the bow, which turns red, and moves the statue to the left, revealing a tunnel in the middle. I go in.</p>
<p>Aaaah! We fall down a waterfall and are now in a huge lake! The Reptile Lair!</p>

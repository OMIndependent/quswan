<p>I&#39;m gonna take a bold guess and say that Ronan is Zorgia in disguise...</p>
<p>Though I read the guide a bit too far and accidentally spoiled myself for a certain moment...but I&#39;m almost close to that point.</p>
<p>I&#39;m now at the Sanctuary and Cemetery. Cephas tells Alundra to be careful, as he has only two graves left...</p>
<p>Ronan says that everything about Alundra&#39;s own blood rests on his own head...</p>
<p>After scavenging for money in shrubs near the Sanctuary I head to the village.</p>
<p>Nestus and Bergus told us about the fairy pond we went to earlier.</p>
<p>Talis theorizes that if Alundra had not come, the village would end up with lots of death.</p>
<p>The Mayor says that Lutas wants to tell us something, while some of the villagers want to move out.</p>
<p>Wendell says that Ronan was watching Lutas carefully. Rumi says the same thing that Mayor Beaumont said.</p>
<p><strong>Wendell:</strong> &quot;An idle mind is the devil&#39;s workshop!&quot;</p>
<p>Septimus tells a story about Lutas and him near the coal mine, where Ronan saved Lutas&#39;s life by shoving him out of the way from a falling boulder...Septimus doesn&#39;t think he&#39;s evil, but I think otherwise...</p>
<p>Phineas doesn&#39;t understand why the young in the village get killed off... <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Bonaire doesn&#39;t have that much to talk about...</p>
<p>Kline&#39;s house is locked... <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png> <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Yuri mentions that Lurvy is also a blacksmith in addition to being a merchant.</p>
<p>Naomi, quit being adultist! Nestus is not a &quot;little stinker!&quot; He&#39;s telling the truth too!</p>
<p>I buy a few herbs from her and leave to go see a few more villagers.</p>
<p>Kisha, sadly, has seen no trace of her brother left, saying that he&#39;s become a stranger in their own house... <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p><strong>Giles:</strong> &quot;I&#39;ll show you...damn evil!&quot; He&#39;s become a fundamentalist templar...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Meade wants to move away to the capital, but the capital&#39;s too scared to let him in because of the curse on the village.</p>
<p>Myra&#39;s still her grumpy old self, Meia&#39;s not here though.</p>
<p>Sierra wants to be alone...I can see why she wants to...poor her... <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Jess says Ronan&#39;s saying strange things...</p>
<p>Gustav&#39;s pretty short fused even without being on the bottle.</p>
<p><strong>Elene:</strong> &quot;The gods are here...there...everywhere...inside of you...inside of me...and they will slay me. I thirst for life. Yet beg for death. Please. Please help me. Help me! Help...Alundra.&quot; Poor Elene...</p>
<p>I head to Lutas&#39;s house. Fein doesn&#39;t think Ronan is evil. I now speak to Lutas.</p>
<p>Lutas says he&#39;s been the target of many assassinations recently, yet Ronan saved him once. He&#39;s asking us if Ronan had something to do with the attempts on his life. I say no even though I know it&#39;s not true.</p>
<p>Ronan saved Lutas twice!?</p>
<p>Meia&#39;s outside. Alundra jumps in surprise at her spying! Geez, Meia!</p>
<p>Meia thinks Alundra might have the reason why Ronan saved Lutas. She mentions Sybill&#39;s final vision to us, in that if Lutas died, he would become the Holy Sword.</p>
<p>So Ronan saved Lutas&#39;s life to prevent us from getting the sword, according to Meia. But Meia asks how did Ronan know about that vision?</p>
<p>She asks if Alundra prayed at all. <strong>Oh my god!!!</strong></p>
<p>Ronan also forced her to do it when she entered the village too, huh? But she refused.</p>
<p>By praying to Melzas, and this was before we knew it, Alundra&#39;s mind was now an open book to him! So he knows what we know, which means...oh my god...<strong>we</strong> were the ones who let Melzas kill most of the villagers...<strong>oh my god...</strong></p>
<p>Meia now wants to go the Sanctuary to destroy the Melzas statue! That was pretty sudden of her to come to that conclusion!</p>
<p>I go to Jess&#39;s and save before following her to the Sanctuary.</p>
<p><strong>Oh my god...</strong></p>

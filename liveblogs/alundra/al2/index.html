<p><img src="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/alundra/images/a/aa/Sybill_artwork.png/revision/latest?cb=20110302184545" alt=sybill width=59 height=166></p>
<p>(Image taken from the <a href=http://alundra.wikia.com/wiki/Sybill>Alundra wikia page</a>)</p>
<p>Sybill says she knows me from her dreams as the hero that would save Inoa, but she notes I&#39;m shorter than she expected. At least I, or my character, looks pretty.</p>
<p>I explore around the village a bit.</p>
<p>Kisha and Giles are pretty religious people...</p>
<p>Oh no, a grandpa&#39;s fallen ill! The family members near his bed are asking for someone named Septimus.</p>
<p>Septimus feels useless, but then spots me (or Alundra) and looks at the mark on my forehead. Blessed and cursed, Alundra is probably the elvish Harry Potter, huh?</p>
<p>So Alundra is a Dreamwalker, and asks me to go to Tarn&#39;s Manor east of the village to find a cure for Grandpa Wendell.</p>
<p>I go to Yustel, a fortune teller, and she tells me to go to a &quot;white terror&quot;. After saying this, she recovers my health and magic.</p>
<p>I also get money by cutting shrubs around the village, and visit a few houses. One house has a resident that blows up a table when she dozes off! Another guy in a different house calls me a dude and a bro, and dreams of ladies! Oh, Working Designs!</p>
<p>I go back to Jess, and he mentions Tarn&#39;s Manor as the abandoned house in the east forest. It was abandoned for ten years and advises me not to go there.</p>
<p>After saving, I leave and visit a house south of Jess, where an herbalist named Naomi runs a shop.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know how the shop system works though...</p>
<p>I finally manage to throw the item I&#39;m supposed to buy on the table and pay for the items. I get a medicinal herb and a tonic, 20 gilders total. I wonder what would&#39;ve happened if I actually left the shop with the item I was carrying... *<em>thinks about Link&#39;s Awakening and shudders</em>*</p>
<p>I now leave for the manor.</p>

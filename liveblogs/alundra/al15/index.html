I hear some squelching sounds, and it turns out they were from sandworms burrowing in the sands on the other side of the cliff!</p>
<p>I go southwards to find myself at the Cliffs.</p>
<p>Alundra never climbs down, he jumps down! &#39;Cause he&#39;s <del>the Batman</del> <strong>Alundra!</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;m now at the bottom of the cliffs, where a sign says &quot;experienced cragsmen only.&quot;</p>
<p>I head east to find a shack, where a sign reads, &quot;Lurvy&#39;s Smith Shack,&quot; promising &quot;armor and weapon repair at low, low prices!&quot; Right.</p>
<p>I go in, with Lurvy pretty excited at a paying customer coming around. Like the sign said, he promises low prices. So I buy a Strength Elixyr (a blue version of the Strength Tonic), and a new <strong>Leather Armor</strong> that&#39;s getting popular with the &quot;neighborhood boys&quot; in-game, according to Lurvy.</p>
<p>There&#39;s also a big arch that wouldn&#39;t feel out of place at Stonehenge near the shack.</p>
<p>I start my jumping spree on the Cliffs.</p>
<p>There are chests scattered around the Cliffs, where I get a Magic Elixyr, and a Wonder Essence.</p>
<p>I go back down to the base. Near the shack, I see a well. Curious, I jump down, and it&#39;s a long drop!</p>
<p>There&#39;s a chest in the well containing a Strength Elixyr, which I bought already, so I can&#39;t keep it!</p>
<p>I go back to the village and save.</p>
<p>I reclimb the Cliffs again and get more herbs from a chest. I climb, or jump, more higher to get to three more chests containing 30 gilders each!</p>
<p>I jump west over the gap and now I&#39;m in front of a cave where the sign claims that this cave goes to the Desert of Despair. *<em>gulp</em>*</p>
<p>As I climb the steps up to the desert, I notice the cave I&#39;m in has a weird rock formation, where everything looks square, and the stairs look like they&#39;re on top of each other...</p>

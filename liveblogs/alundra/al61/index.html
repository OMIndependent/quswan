<p>After rewatching that scene again (and it still hurts! <img class=emojione alt=ðŸ˜¢ title=:cry: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/1f622.png>) I head out of the village.</p>
<p>Gustav asks for my help. What a surprise!</p>
<p>His daughter Elene has collapsed, and he promises to &quot;change for the better&quot; so he can have us help Elene! He&#39;s now begging...</p>
<p>Giles is no longer seeing reason, he now wishes for the gods to come after Alundra next...</p>
<p>Naomi&#39;s faith is almost becoming disillusioned...</p>
<p>I head out of the village. </p>
<p>Cephas apologizes for Jess&#39;s passing, saying if he had not finished work for the day, he would have been alive...</p>
<p>I read Jess&#39;s grave:</p>
<p><strong>JESS.<br>
Artisan of souls.<br>
Oy! Will he be missed!</strong></p>

<hr>
<p>Now there&#39;s only one empty plot left...</p>
<p>I use the portals to head to Lurvy&#39;s hut, knowing from Yuri about his smithing skills, and give him the Broken Armor. He asks for a measly...<strong>2163 gilders</strong> to smith the armor to life! Lucky I have about 2700!</p>
<p>With Lurvy&#39;s handiwork, we get the restored <strong>Ancient Armor!</strong></p>
<p>Thank you very kindly, Lurvy!</p>
<p>The Ancient Armor is made out of copper!</p>
<p>After wandering around the map looking for more money, I go back to the village, save, and go to Elene&#39;s house.</p>
<p>Before I head to the village, I visit Nava, who says that I must be wary of Giles!</p>
<p>Lutas says even Meia can&#39;t enter Elene&#39;s nightmares alone, since they&#39;ve grown stronger!</p>
<p>Kisha states that Elene is now victim to a nightmare! She&#39;s also beginning to lose faith in the gods as well.</p>
<p>Gustav swears on his life to quit drinking all for us to save Elene.</p>
<p>Mayor Beaumont said that Elene doesn&#39;t deserve all that she&#39;s been given so far. I agree.</p>
<p>Septimus says that Meia&#39;s already in Elene&#39;s dream.</p>
<p>Meia mentions Elene having multiple personalities. Four of them, Meia counts. Because of this, her nightmare would be tough to conquer alone. We jump in.</p>
<p>Meia stops us and asks us if she could join in too. I accept her help.</p>
<p><strong>Meia:</strong> &quot;In fact, together, I believe we can conquer almost anything.&quot; That line sounds like she&#39;s unknowingly shipping herself with Alundra. But I like the character development from Meia, the earlier Meia wouldn&#39;t ask for help so easily...</p>
<p>Septimus asks if we are going to jump in to Elene&#39;s mind now. I say yes.</p>
<p><strong>*dream whoosh*</strong></p>

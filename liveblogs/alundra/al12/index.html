<p>After looking up a strategy guide online to get the chest in the crypt, I head back to the chasm below the arrow conveyor paths, where the fast zombies await.</p>
<p>The platforms start moving after I take care of the zombies. After some trouble trying to sync the platforms since I keep stopping their movements, I grab what&#39;s in the chest, a Strength Tonic.</p>
<p>I now make my way outside the crypt. My goodness, that was a long dungeon!</p>
<p>What the...the ground is shaking! Oh, the crypt stone sealed the way back!</p>
<p>I do some exploring around the area before I return to the village.</p>
<p>I wonder what these strange stone arches are for? I know I&#39;ve seen some of these around the map.</p>
<p>When are the villagers gonna clean up that fallen tree that&#39;s blocking the way to the desert?</p>
<p>I fight one of the orcs, which take five hits from my weapon to take care of, and they hurt me a lot!</p>
<p>Oh no, someone&#39;s fallen ill, and it&#39;s Nadia, who hasn&#39;t slept for six days straight, according to Rumi!</p>
<p>She&#39;s talking about Bonaire!</p>
<p>Now that Nadia&#39;s dozed off, something&#39;s exploded!</p>
<p>Myra wants death to greet her, and Olen&#39;s house just exploded because Nadia dozed off, no!</p>
<p>Nadia wants to tell Bonaire how she feels about him, or at least for him to smile at her before she sleeps.</p>
<p>I go to get him, along with seven herbs from Naomi.</p>
<p>I go to Jess, and he tells me not just Nadia, but Bonaire has also fallen ill! No wonder why this is called a &quot;Slumber Bummer&quot;.</p>
<p>Bonaire, like what Jess said, has also gotten sick, and he keeps calling for someone named Sara.</p>
<p>Looks like it&#39;s time for more dreamwalking!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>*dream whoosh*</strong></p>
<p><a href=http://vgmaps.com/Atlas/PSX/Alundra-Bonaire%27sDream.png>Here&#39;s the map for Bonaire&#39;s Dream.</a></p>
<p>Bonaire is dreaming of Sara, some blonde with a black dress, and vanishes with her.</p>
<p>I go straight ahead and slice the orb that a dragon statue is holding, turning the blue blocks invisible.</p>
<p>There&#39;s also a teleporter (a symbol, except it&#39;s not glowing) there, and I cross it inside another part of the dream.</p>
<p>There&#39;s also spiked balls in this dream now! My goodness!</p>
<p>I take another teleporter back and as I&#39;m writing this, I&#39;m greeted by a blue slime beneath the shrubs! I take care of him!</p>
<p>There&#39;s also a lever on a ledge. However, as soon as I turn it, revealing another teleporter, it flips back.</p>
<p>I jump down to a lower cliff and push a rock, revealing a ladder from a higher ledge.</p>
<p>I go back and push another rock revealing another ladder, and I climb it, where smaller moving spiked balls are there.</p>
<p>After making it to the top ledge, I jump down after seeing a locked door.</p>
<p>I head east, slicing the dragon statue orb, and making the red blocks invisible.</p>
<p>I jump down from the bridge connecting to the orb, and open a chest, containing a key.</p>
<p>I go to the teleporter that the red block was blocking and I head to a northern ledge, where four blue slimes are waiting for me.</p>
<p>There&#39;s also treasure too, which has another key inside.</p>
<p>I open the locked door, and move forward, where on the other side, Bonaire is getting lured in by Sara to the &quot;gates of rapturous paradise.&quot; Right...</p>
<p>I step on a switch, pushing a block outside, or vanishing it. I jump from the bridge to the ledge, where the teleporter forward was supposed to be.</p>
<p>I give up and jump down to the lowest ledge in the area, where a glowing teleporter awaits, and step in, and save.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>After lots of wandering (for Alundra) and a lot of thinking (for me), I decide to throw a bomb near the lever switch.</p>
<p>It works and I go to the next area, where there&#39;s more shrubs and a locked door, and a teleporter.</p>
<p>I take the teleporter back to the same area where the other teleporters took me back to.</p>
<p>I go back and unlock the door forward. Dammit! I needed to turn the blue blocks off to go forward.</p>
<p>After doing that, I head up the steps, where there are two dragon statue orbs, which toggle the blocks based on their color, and a locked door in the middle.</p>
<p>I switch the blue blocks on to get the chest holding the key to open the door.</p>
<p>I move forward, and another chest is there, containing a Life Vessel!!!</p>
<p>As well as a blue block blocking a teleporter to the area where Bonaire was, with a Gilded Falcon in a chest left of me.</p>
<p>Bonaire is moving forward to Sara.</p>
<p>I know where this is going...</p>
<p>Sara sees me, and is pissed! She sends more fast zombies for me to take care of!</p>
<p>Along with big, bouncing spiked balls!</p>
<p>I move forward, where she considers Bonaire, the Waverunner, to be...a fine snack!</p>
<p><img src=http://data.whicdn.com/images/19380688/large.gif alt="marceline what"></p>
<p>Oh god, Sara&#39;s a cannibal!!</p>
<p>But now she&#39;s turned her sights on us, or Alundra, a more &quot;substansial&quot; meal, in her opinion.</p>
<p>She strikes a deal with us to become her &quot;love slave,&quot; and later, meal, in exchange for Bonaire&#39;s life!</p>
<p>Sara transforms into a flying, potbellied gargoyle, and the fight is on!</p>
<p>She teleports away! This is gonna be a very tricky fight!</p>
<p>I die, but my Wonder Essence saves me!</p>
<p>Her patterns are usually warp, throw three purple fireballs, then appear with copies of her spinning around me, or with her charging towards me, then warp.</p>
<p>Her scream indicates that I got her!</p>
<p>Sara has been &quot;crushed,&quot; indeed!</p>
<p>Now Bonaire wakes up, and Sara is still pining for Bonaire as she calls him a jerk, er, a stud.</p>
<p>And she is, in surf speak, bummed, but she now plans on taking Nadia as her last move!</p>
<p><strong>*exit dream whoosh*</strong></p>
<p>I am laughing at this guy&#39;s &quot;excellent&quot; speak again, and calls Sara his &quot;betty&quot; that really wasn&#39;t his cup of tea. He&#39;s also aware of Nadia&#39;s attraction to him too.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Sara did her deed, as Nadia has died in her sleep...<strong>dammit!</strong></p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Alundra&#39;s heroic efforts saved Bonaire...But as dawn came, something was different in the village of Inoa...</strong>&quot; :(</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m trying to get more gilders (money) to get another Life Vessel for Alundra.</p>
<p>I meet these new lizardpeople enemies and try to hit them, but they&#39;re very good with their shield.</p>
<p>A path to a desert is blocked by a fallen tree, which I try to use a bomb to blow it up, but it doesn&#39;t work.</p>
<p>The quest to get 500 gilders for one Life Vessel continues!</p>
<p>These wasps are hard to hit!</p>
<p>More exploring leads me to find some rubble which I blow up to reveal a cave, with more blue slimes! A chest has an herb but I can&#39;t carry more than nine herbs!</p>
<p>There&#39;s also a platform on the water with that same symbol that I saw in the mines.</p>
<p>After taking care of the blue slimes, I get a treasure with a Wonder Essence inside, which revives Alundra fully in case he dies, yes!!!</p>
<p>Now I have enough money to buy the Vessel! Yes!!</p>
<p>There&#39;s a lot of ravens hanging around Inoa now.</p>
<p>It&#39;s graveyard time!</p>
<p>The gravekeeper that blocked the cemetery is now gone, I go into the house, where I head to its basement. The basement has these six silver huge chalice torches on top of coffins. I think I might get an item later to light them.</p>
<p>I&#39;m now reading the graves:</p>
<p><strong>JAYLEN.<br>
He had a passion for life.</strong></p>
<p><strong>LYMAN.<br>
He loved his work. We don&#39;t know why.</strong></p>
<p><strong>ZANE.<br>
His smile will continue to brighten our memories.</strong></p>
<p>There are also a few empty plots around the graveyard too. I&#39;m betting more people are going to die in this game... :(</p>
<p>Finally, I look at Olen&#39;s grave:</p>
<p><strong>OLEN.<br>
Loved by all, feared by none.</strong></p>
<p>I put the bouquet on Olen&#39;s grave, and Alundra prays silently.</p>

<p>How I left the shrine is to go south and head to any direction.</p>
<p>As for leaving the desert, the quickest way is by the northwest path, south of the cave where I found the Sand Cape. I burrow below and leave the desert behind!</p>
<p>I go back to the upper part of the mine, and go to the water where I had to fight those blue slimes.</p>
<p>Turns out the guide said that there were <strong>50</strong> of them I had to fight!</p>
<p>After getting all 50 of them, which felt like an eternity (but only 8-10 minutes, I think), I get a chest containing herbs.</p>
<p>I head south, where the iron bars are now gone and I end up falling down the east house&#39;s chimney to reach a chest containing a Gilded Falcon. I push the lever opening the gate.</p>
<p>I explore more of the area, heading southwest past the Pond. At the west, I&#39;m near a place called the Fire Manor.</p>
<p>I go north to find tall pillars and an orc with a swinging flail!</p>
<p>After grabbing a chest of herbs, I double back.</p>
<p>I bomb the stumps and head east, and I&#39;m now near Nava&#39;s house. I bomb another stump north to get a chest with a Gilded Falcon inside. I now have 11 of these. What are these falcons for anyway?</p>
<p>I break the square block westward and cross north to find a chest with a Magic Seed inside!!!</p>
<p>This means my magic meter has upgraded to 2!</p>
<p>Since I have lots of gilders, I go to the Cliffs to buy some more stuff from Lurvy!</p>
<p>I get a Life Vessel, which costs 400 gilders, upgrading my health to 16!!</p>
<p>I climb the Cliffs again to get one more chest...30 gilders.</p>
<p>Now I head back to the shrine after that long detour!</p>

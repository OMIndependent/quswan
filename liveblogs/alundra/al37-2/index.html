<p>But Meia comes out of the house and tells us the same thing she said about entering Kline&#39;s Nightmare! She is also pretty doubtful of the whole situation. She also calls Septimus a &quot;foul trickster&quot; and leaves.</p>
<p>Mayor Beaumont confirms Meia&#39;s diagnosis of Giles.</p>
<p>Kisha knew Giles was going to end up like this, but she doesn&#39;t want to see him go...</p>
<p>Septimus tells us that Meia entered Giles&#39;s dream, but failed to save him...</p>
<p>I wander around the overworld again, looking for more stuff that I missed.</p>
<p>Meia&#39;s now near the Sanctuary, examining the place, saying nothing to us.</p>
<p>Kisha begs us to save Giles from his nightmare, just to try, and is well aware that we don&#39;t need to help him after all that he&#39;s said to us.</p>
<p>Kisha is on her last rope as she begs Alundra to save him. I accept, since it&#39;s the only way forward.</p>
<p>Septimus warns me to be careful, mentioning Kline again...</p>
<p>I check my supplies before heading in.</p>
<p>Here we go!</p>

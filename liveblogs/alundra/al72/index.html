<p>It&#39;s still the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Septimus&#39;s place is open though...</p>
<p>He&#39;s still researching on how to rescue Bergus and advises us to head to Bergus&#39;s house.</p>
<p>I head to the house...</p>
<p>I&#39;m low on recovery items...no Wonder Essence or Strength Tonic. Only one herb left...</p>
<p>Meade&#39;s there to greet us, and explains the situation. Meade sent Bergus and Nestus to sleep a few hours ago, and after a while, he heard a window shatter. The Murgg came and kidnapped Bergus! Bergus tried to scream, but the Murgg were long gone by then.</p>
<p>Meade begs us for help to find Bergus!</p>
<p>Now that I think about it, one of the visions that Sybill shared with us a long time ago showed us the Murgg kidnapping someone and jumping into their mind after taking them into one of their cells...</p>
<p>I head upstairs, where Rumi, Grandpa Wendell, Meade, and Meia are, with Nestus in bed.</p>
<p>Everyone is feeling regretful and sad about Bergus&#39;s kidnapping...with Nestus crying himself to sleep... <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Septimus arrives with good news!</p>
<p>He says that identical twins often have the same dreams. So that means, according to Meia, we can enter Nestus&#39;s dream and exit from Bergus&#39;s. But both of them need to be asleep for it to work.</p>
<p>Septimus tasks us with the job. He assumes that Bergus was taken to one of the cells in the Giant Tree Tower, meaning a fleet of Murgg will be waiting for us. He tells me not to underestimate the challenges ahead.</p>
<p>Meia&#39;s...worried about us now.</p>
<p>I accept the task and jump into Nestus&#39;s mind.</p>

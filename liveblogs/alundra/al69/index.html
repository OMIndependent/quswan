<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>Now my next job is to head to the lake and place the two Crests in their pedestals.</p>
<p>I&#39;m betting that the <strong>Agate Crest</strong> might be the Coastal Cave&#39;s Crest, and the <strong>Garnet Crest</strong> Magyscar&#39;s.</p>
<p>I wander around the map first, heading off to the northeastern part of Murgg Woods, and into the cabin where a lever near a tightly woven cell is, which is &quot;rusted shut.&quot;</p>
<p>I go back and now place Crests onto their pedestals.</p>
<p>I grab the remaining Strength Tonic from a chest in the swamp, and the two herbs from the chests southwest of the Tarn&#39;s Manor area.</p>
<p>With nowhere else to go, I head into the pub, where one of the pirates there mentions Captain Merrick looking for &quot;Gilded Falcons ever since he first set out to sea,&quot; and says he may be interested if I have them...hmmm...</p>
<p>I head into Merrick&#39;s shop, and talk to him about the Falcons. We make a deal that if we found any Falcons, we would give them to him, compensating for all the 10,000 gilder stuff he&#39;s been selling on the table!</p>
<p>I talk to him again and give him all 41 of the Gilded Falcons I have so far!</p>
<p>I get <strong>Olga&#39;s Ring (!)</strong>, a <strong>Silver Armlet (!!)</strong>, a <strong>Recovery Ring (!!!)</strong>, and three Life Vessels!!! Yes!!! So much prizes!!! :smiling:</p>
<p>My health is now maxed up to 43!!!</p>
<p>So <strong>Olga&#39;s Ring</strong> increases attack power, <strong>Silver Armlet</strong> increases defense, and the <strong>Recovery Ring</strong> restores health while walking, like a Regen Ring in Final Fantasy or something!</p>
<p>This is a wondrous day <strong>indeed!!!</strong></p>
<p>I get a Magic Elixyr from Lurvy, save, and head back to the village.</p>
<p>So now I have one important item left that I can carry in my inventory...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>As I enter the village, a whole lot of shaking&#39;s going on...</p>
<p>Mayor Beaumont asks us if it was an earthquake, or something else...</p>
<p>Thyea assumes that the shaking is coming from up north. Torla Mountain is north of here, meaning something&#39;s happened there...</p>
<p>Kisha&#39;s now asking why Melzas wants to destroy the village with lava instead of nightmares...</p>
<p>Bergus wants to check out Torla Mountain, but Nestus is scared...</p>
<p>Meade says that there&#39;s a trail leading to Torla Mountain near Magyscar, but Rumi mentions the path there full of broken bridges and dangerous chasms...</p>
<p>Mt. Torla erupting means that something terrible is going to happen...</p>
<p>Lutas mentions Yuri trying to look for herbs in Torla Mountain, thinking he&#39;s foolish for doing so.</p>
<p>Fein says that Ronan says that the gods exist and that she trusts him...</p>
<p>Gustav believes in Alundra. Elene says something wise, in that everyone dies, but how one chooses to die is what&#39;s important, especially with Alundra...</p>
<p>Naomi&#39;s in shock of Mt. Torla erupting!</p>
<p>As I leave Naomi&#39;s shop, Yuri returns from his search for a rare herb.</p>
<p>He says that &quot;the start of the trail is just to the right of Magyscar,&quot; and that he headed &quot;east along the trail and straight to the Mountain.&quot; He found no rare herbs, but the Mountain is covered in lava and fire! Alundra wants to know how to get inside, but Yuri says that&#39;s impossible unless we go to <strong>the Ice Manor and get the Ice Wand there.</strong></p>

<p>Lucky I got the Ice Wand ahead of time! But...that means going through <strong>those</strong> sliding puzzles are <strong>required!?</strong> This is definitely a hard game indeed!</p>

<p><strong>Septimus:</strong> &quot;Some of the villagers are saying Torla erupted because the gods are angry. But, I don&#39;t think that means that Melzas is within the mountain, Alundra. I think that Melzas might be within the palace at the bottom of the deep lake.&quot;</p>
<p>Bonaire&#39;s &quot;bummed&quot; again at Torla Mountain erupting, saying it was a great snowboarding spot. I laugh a little.</p>
<p>Meia confirms one of my guesses from the beginning: <strong>the Murgg are being controlled by Melzas himself.</strong></p>
<p>She adds that the earthquake was caused by Mt. Torla&#39;s eruption. </p>
<p>Alundra says he&#39;s going to the mountain. Meia&#39;s shocked! </p>
<p>Meia then tells him to promise that he will &quot;extinguish [the mountain&#39;s] flames.&quot; Alundra, do you know something that I don&#39;t?</p>
<p>If Alundra&#39;s going there because might be a Crest in that location, that might make sense...</p>
<p>Myra thinks the eruption is a sign that someone&#39;s going to die next! There&#39;s only one empty plot in the Graveyard left...</p>
<p><strong>Sierra:</strong> &quot;The gods are angry with us! We were all fools to doubt their existence...&quot;</p>
<p>After saving I head to Ronan.</p>
<p><strong>Ronan:</strong> &quot;We are experiencing that vile fruit of the gods&#39; anger. The eruption is but a small sign of their displeasure. There will be more...many more, I am certain.&quot;</p>
<p>Cephas advises us to go to the mountain anyway, and that his life would be in danger if he said anymore...oh! Looks like Ronan might be at it with his tricks again!</p>
<p>If it takes an eruption, or an act of nature, to silence a village...</p>
<p>Nava says that &quot;&#39;he&#39; has awakened.&quot; Who is this &quot;he&quot; that he&#39;s talking about?</p>
<p>I&#39;m assuming there may be another Crest in the mountain: either an <strong>Emerald</strong> or the <strong>Diamond</strong>.</p>

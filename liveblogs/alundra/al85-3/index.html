<p>Okay, back to finishing this game off!</p>
<p>I use the teleporter in the village well to get back to the Lake Shrine!</p>
<p>Now, back to that room with the fire spouts!</p>
<p>Three more barriers to turn off...</p>
<p>I head to the west clock tower, and I figure out what the press switches near the stairways do...they raise and lower the spiked balls!</p>
<p>I realize that the door to go to that room was open!</p>
<p>I&#39;m now back in the fire spout room, or a bedroom with four fire spouts, a press switch, a column, and a treasure chest raised high up by a platform. Why do things look easy, but at close glance, they&#39;re not?</p>
<p>The upper right and bottom left fire spouts shoot flames in a clockwise pattern, while the upper left and bottom right shoot counterclockwise.</p>
<p>I push the column carefully to the switch.</p>
<p>But, there&#39;s another twist to this puzzle, as I notice four balloon switches on top of platforms above in the north part of the room, and I can&#39;t push the column downwards.</p>
<p>I reset the puzzle. Since it&#39;s near a table instead of a high wall at the start, I push the column south easily.</p>
<p>The switch didn&#39;t lower the chest, but it lowered the balloons!</p>
<p>I fire at them until they all turn green!</p>
<p>Only the second left one is red now.</p>
<p>I realize that I&#39;m not harmed at all by the flames from the spouts! It&#39;s <strong>Nava&#39;s Charm</strong> at work. Thank you, Nava!</p>
<p>I push the column ever so slightly until it&#39;s barely touching the press switch, but it&#39;s enough distance for me to jump and hit the balloon.</p>
<p>The chest lowers, and I get a Magic Eliyxr!</p>
<p>I use the spring pot to try to jump to the other side, but I fall into the chasm, and end up in the dining room!</p>
<p>I head back and try again, and make it!</p>
<p>Two of the four doors in this hall are locked...</p>
<p>I head to the far left room, where I&#39;m at a bedroom with two four-posters, a huge spiked ball moving up and down, and four platforms moving in a circle.</p>
<p>A jar and a small cabinet give enough height for me to reach the platforms...</p>
<p>A press switch is on the upper left end of the room.</p>
<p>With a few bumps and bruises from the spiked ball, I make it and press the switch!</p>
<p>That opened the door to the next room!</p>
<p>I&#39;m in another two-four poster bedroom with six suits of armor as centerpieces!</p>
<p>I break all the suits to reveal torches!</p>
<p>I light up all the torches and a chest drops...on top of the lower right torch!</p>
<p>I reset the puzzle and realize the moment I finished it again that the chest only drops on the torch that was the last one to be lit!</p>
<p>I try the puzzle a few times more, making sure the chest lands on the upper left torch...</p>
<p>I get a key from the chest, and the door south opens!</p>

<hr>
<p>I head east into the first room in the hallway. Oh my god, there&#39;s fire spouts and mummies in this bedroom!</p>
<p>Nine fire spouts shooting upwards are here, along with a balloon switch, and a press switch at the north end.</p>
<p>With caution, I study the patterns of the flame spurts here, and cross the fire spouts. I pop the balloon green.</p>
<p>What that did was reverse the pattern of the flame spurts!</p>
<p>I manage to fall a few times...</p>
<p>...and I press the other switch...the room west opens up!</p>
<p>Just like in the east hall, there&#39;s a staircase in the north, and the way back to the hall south.</p>
<p>However, there&#39;s a huge spiked ball protecting a press switch, and two suits of armor here.</p>
<p>I break the suits, where the south one has a jar inside.</p>
<p>Risking huge damage, I press the switch to open the exit to the hallway.</p>
<p>I head upstairs...</p>
<p>The same press switch room as the east wing, except the switches are now more closer together, and there&#39;s no pillar here to use as a jumping step.</p>
<p>I figure out the pattern to press the switches to open the door here, as their floors lower once they&#39;ve been pressed.</p>
<p>The right switch is not raised, while the rest are...</p>
<p>Miraculously, after a few tries, I press all of them, and open the door!</p>
<p>No spiked balls in this attic hallway!</p>
<p>I unlock the north door, and head south.</p>
<p>I&#39;m now in the attic cellar full of barrels, and more gargoyles!</p>
<p>There&#39;s two openings out in the left side of this attic instead of one.</p>
<p>I go back to the hallway and head into the unlocked door.</p>
<p>There&#39;s three slow moving platforms here.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a column at the east end on a ledge, and a press switch at the west end of a ledge, which opens the pillars blocking another press switch probably lowering one of the barriers at the main hall.</p>
<p>What I have to do here is to push the column to the other side of the room using those platforms...</p>
<p>Whoooo, the column&#39;s vibrating!</p>
<p>Oddly enough, as soon as I push the column to the second platform, it&#39;s already on the third one!</p>
<p>I push the column to the switch, and <strong>down goes barrier number four!</strong></p>
<p>I exit through the attic and walk over the roof and jump down to reach a chest on another part of the perch.</p>
<p>The chest has a Wonder Essence!</p>
<p>Since I&#39;m at half health, I use up the Essence I have, and get the one in the chest.</p>
<p>I head back inside, and cross the hallway.</p>
<p>I jump down to the chasm where the dining room is, and head to the main hall, admiring my work.</p>
<p>I teleport back to the village and save my progress.</p>
<p>This is one of the first times I&#39;ve had to double check if I actually saved my game! I head back to the Shrine to see if I shut off four barriers. Good, I did.</p>
<p>After that, I stop here.</p>

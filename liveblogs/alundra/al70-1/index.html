<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>I warp near Magyscar&#39;s entrance area.</p>
<p>I equip the Ice Wand and use the trail that Yuri talked about to get there, if I could find it...</p>
<p>I make it to the ledge south of the Mountain&#39;s entrance where a rocky platform is lifted up by a water spout, or hot, blue flames.</p>
<p>I&#39;m now inside the mountain proper, which has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OR93eaeEdC4">music that starts as some culturally appropriative chanting, drums, and synthesized vocals...</a></p>
<p>And there&#39;s plenty of hot lava here!</p>
<p>I light some torches with the Fire Wand, opening the gate forward.</p>
<p>There are fiery pillars ahead, which I freeze and crush with the Ice Wand, and the flail, respectively.</p>
<p>The torch flames can be extinguished with the Ice Wand too!</p>
<p>After dousing the right torch, the second gate forward opens.</p>
<p>I jump around the ledges east, avoiding the lava below!</p>
<p>There&#39;s also rock turtles, but their skin looks more olive looking instead of green!</p>
<p>I jump down the ledge, and read a sign which is an obvious warning that the lava is very hot here, and people shouldn&#39;t cross it.</p>
<p>There&#39;s also a chest in the middle of the lava!</p>
<p>I go back near the entrance of the chamber and jump on the ledge north while avoiding the moving fireballs.</p>
<p>I drop down into the lava, owch! And leap over to the land, pressing a switch there and opening the gates. I proceed into the tunnel there.</p>
<p>No way to cross up there, so I head back. There are fast moving fireballs in that room, though, and more lava!</p>
<p>Now I&#39;m stuck! Is there any way to get back up to the ledge?</p>
<p>I go back in that tunnel and realize I can freeze the fireballs for a short time!</p>
<p>Freezing these fireballs can mess up their timing, and as I read the guide again, it says that this part is &quot;very annoying.&quot;</p>
<p>After a while later, I make it! Now I&#39;m in another chamber with a tunnel in front of me, a staircase in the east part of the fork, and more lava in the west part! The olive rock turtles are also here too!</p>
<p>At the west part of the fork, there&#39;s a save teleporter, yes!</p>
<p>I also see two chests on the ledge north of the teleporter!</p>
<p>I recover and save here.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I head up the staircase, and as I&#39;m writing this, I get blown by fire from one of those fire spouts that I saw in the Great Tree!</p>
<p>I turn off the spout by jumping on top of it!</p>
<p>After stopping two more fire spouts, I head down the ledge and head west where there&#39;s a chest at the end, more herbs!</p>
<p>I go east and jump past the lava and head out into the tunnel south.</p>
<p>I&#39;m back near the sign at the entrance.</p>
<p>I head back to the fire spouts, go downstairs, and into the center tunnel where more fire spouts out from the walls!</p>
<p>Jeez, this place is fiery!</p>
<p>As I head into the next room filled with lava, a firebird attacks me! I take care of it with a single freeze from the Ice Wand.</p>
<p>Seeing no way to cross, I head back to the save teleporter, and recover.</p>
<p>I go back to the second chamber full of lava and cross the north ledges. I&#39;m back at the room with the fire spouts!</p>
<p>I jump over a gap and head straight into the next passage!</p>
<p>There&#39;s another fire spout with more lava here!</p>
<p>I cross the flame spurt filled ledges here, and switch off another four-way spout.</p>
<p>I head north, where more shrill whistling firebirds arise from the lava!</p>
<p>After taking care of the firebirds, the gate north opens!</p>
<p>There&#39;s also a chest tucked away and flanked by two jars on a northeast ledge.</p>
<p>Two more fire pillars in this chamber!</p>
<p>I freeze both and push one north, and I&#39;m still trying to figure out what to do with the east one!</p>
<p>This puzzle is a bit stressful...</p>
<p>I make it!</p>
<p>The solution for this is that I moved the left pillar: <strong>east, north,</strong> and <strong>east</strong>, and the right pillar: <strong>north</strong> and <strong>east</strong>.</p>
<p>I climb up the ledges, where I see a huge lava pool and...four more moving fireballs again!</p>
<p>This puzzle&#39;s gonna destroy me...</p>
<p>I&#39;m supposed to make an ice staircase with these fireballs since the platform forward is high up there!</p>
<p>As long as I stand on an ice platform, I won&#39;t melt the ice that I&#39;m on now.</p>
<p>Eventually, I make it, and head north where I&#39;m now in a lava pool chamber with fire torches on islands! The earlier puzzle was <strong>so stressful!</strong></p>

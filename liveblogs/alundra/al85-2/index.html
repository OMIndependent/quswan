<p>Giving up on that puzzle again, I press the east wing switch inside the suit of armor, flipping the gate again, and opening a way in to the east wing hallway, where I see three passages: a passage east, and two rooms, one of which is locked.</p>
<p>I head east, and double back to that doorway.</p>
<p>The royal bedroom is pretty vast, where I see a chest on top of a shelf. Two barrels, and a press switch are high in midair. After jumping on a desk to the shelf, I grab the key from the chest.</p>
<p>I leave the bedroom, and head east, where I see two more rooms. I play around with the Fire Wand, seeing if I could light the stone torch on the right of the first room. Failing that, I go in...</p>
<p>It&#39;s another bedroom, and six blue gargoyles are there, frozen in time...</p>
<p>Next room...just more posh palace quarters...</p>
<p>I head back past the dining hall, past the tentacle creatures, and into the suit of armor room. After breaking the barrel, I use it to get to a ledge where a locked door lies.</p>
<p>Climbing up more stairs now...</p>
<p>I&#39;m now in a room with high ledges, on the top are two gargoyles frozen in time...a barrel is in the reachable center ledge, and a few crates are also visible. I press a nearby switch...something clicks!</p>
<p>After I let go, the switch turns off again!</p>
<p>I use the barrel as a weight on the switch, after carrying a crate out of the way, I see another barrel on the ground!</p>
<p>The rail on the west side is gone!</p>
<p>I carry the second barrel as a stepping stone, and make it up to the northern part of the room!</p>
<p>I pass the frozen gargoyles, press another switch, and climb the stairs, where I see another switch that instantly clicks off when I step on it.</p>
<p>Huge spiked balls are frozen above!</p>
<p>Another flight of stairs west, and I see another press switch!</p>
<p>A pair of barrels are here too, but they fail in keeping the switches on.</p>
<p>I now see a chest at a ledge at the foot of the stairs, which have only herbs.</p>
<p>I accidentally hit one of the spiked balls again! Ouch!</p>
<p>There&#39;s also a platform which I try to carry the barrels there as makeshift stepping stones, but one of the spiked balls hit me!</p>
<p>Time to try this again!</p>
<p>And again! Once more!</p>
<p>I equip my Recovery Ring, and wait for a while...I head back to action!</p>
<p>I try this again! As many times as it takes!</p>
<p>At try number 7, I head out to recover my health and magic.</p>
<p>Back to those barrels in the staircase with those spiked balls again!</p>

<hr>
<p>Yes, I make it! I climb the ladder to the top of the west tower of the Shrine! I see a lot of gears and clockwork in this room, this must be a clock tower of sorts. Drosselmeyer himself would love the Lake Shrine, I bet...</p>
<p>There&#39;s a lever, a chest, and a press switch on top of a frozen platform high above! I open the chest first: another key!</p>
<p>I hit the lever next, which...does nothing.</p>
<p>Disappointed, I head back down.</p>
<p>I wonder what this key opens to...</p>
<p>I stop here and save at Jess&#39;s house.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>After reading the guide, I find out that I was on the right track, and I just did half the work, now I have to go to the east clock tower and hit the lever there. Then the first part of this final dungeon is done!</p>
<p>Okay, back to the Shrine!</p>
<p>So what I have to do in the east library is to carry a barrel that&#39;s on the top of the second bookshelf and use that as a stepping stone!</p>
<p>I use that barrel and place it on a chair to reach a chest on top of the first bookshelf, which has herbs.</p>
<p>I move the barrel to another chair and use it to get to the top of a bookshelf, and I jump on each shelf until I make it to the east end of the library.</p>
<p>There&#39;s another prompt on a bookshelf, and lots of slanted desk chairs here.</p>
<p>I hit the lever with the sword, lowering a bookshelf blocking the way back to the main hall, and read the prompt near the east passage: &quot;<strong>Towers pierce the sky in the direction where the light is born and dies. The towers meant to control time are in a deep slumber.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s talking about the clock towers here. I proceed east.</p>
<p>I pass a room full of tentacle monsters frozen in time. There&#39;s also a locked door here. Moving east...</p>
<p>More suits of armor here...I smash all of them, three of them are empty, one of them is a mummy, another holds a chest of herbs, and that&#39;s it.</p>
<p>I head back to the library to fetch the barrel.</p>
<p>The barrel, however, disappears once I head into the next room...so now what&#39;s next?</p>
<p>I head back to the armory, uselessly trying to find a way to get up to the ledge where the locked door is. I use a bomb to injure Alundra (sorry!) so I can use an herb (since I&#39;m carrying 9 at this point) to get an herb from the chest...</p>
<p>I head back to the library, and then I pause and read the guide again...it seems I have to jump using the chest and the suit of armor as platforms to get to the locked room...</p>
<p>I&#39;m in, and I climb a set of stairs to the west...</p>
<p>Three columns block my way forward. After the third try, where I push the left column north, and the center one right, I climb the ladder.</p>
<p>Two blue gargoyles, frozen in time, are also at the base of the stairs heading to the clock tower. A few press switches are scattered around the stairway, and small spiked balls are in the way forward.</p>
<p>I tread carefully to make it to the ladder to the clock tower.</p>
<p>I make it! After grabbing the key from the chest, I hit the lever! A flash of light...</p>
<p><strong>Time is now flowing back to the Shrine!</strong></p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I wait for the platform with the press switch to lower. Using the chest as a stepping stone, I pres the switch, opening the door outside!</p>
<p>My god, what a view!</p>
<p>I climb the stairs up and another hidden to the right to where a chest is, holding a key.</p>
<p>I head back in, and jump down, and jump down again to the base of the staircase, where the blue gargoyles are now warping around!</p>
<p>After taking care of them, and the gray tentacle monsters in another room, I tail back to the hallway!</p>
<p>First, I use one of the herbs, and get another from the chest!</p>
<p>I head west to the dining room, where the lever&#39;s lowered now.</p>
<p>Flipping the lever right, four torches come down on each table!</p>
<p>I reread the first prompt from the library, and use that as my guide to light the torches in order!</p>
<p>Starting from the north table, I light the torches from right to left! The south table, same. The northwestern door opens!</p>
<p>I&#39;m now in a kitches, where more gargoyles want to play with me!</p>
<p>After taking care of them, a chest drops, containing another Life Vessel!!!</p>
<p>My health is now at 47!!!</p>
<p>I go back to the west suits of armor room, and accidentally break the armor where the mummy was!</p>
<p>After taking care of him, and finding the suit of armor with the barrel, I leave and go back. Using the same strategy to get to the eastern clock tower, I break the armor to find the barrel and use another suit of armor to get to the ledge where the chest was. The chest has a Strength Tonic!</p>
<p>I head back to the main hall and head upstairs, breaking the armor containing the east press switch, flipping the gate horizontally!</p>
<p>I did not notice there was a huge gap at that part of the hall! I head north in one of the bedrooms, where two barrels and a press switch drop! I use the barrel on the switch to open the door east!</p>
<p>There&#39;s a suit of armor covered by square blocks, two press switches, a gate south and a staircase north.</p>
<p>I head up, where I see scattered press switches on tall blocks except for one, and a column in center of a circle of switches.</p>
<p>I press one of the switches, lowering it. Counting the one I pressed, there are 14 of them!</p>
<p>There is an order to pressing all of them, but it&#39;s timing that&#39;s important here!</p>
<p>After a few tries, I hear the okay sound, and the door south opens!</p>
<p>I&#39;m now in a room with two huge fast moving spiked balls!</p>
<p>Treading carefully, I head to the south passage, where I see a lot of gargoyles warping everywhere in the next room!</p>
<p>This room is probably an attic of sorts meeting a maze! After heading up a flight of stairs, I see a press switch. After takng care of one of the gargoyles, I press the switch, flipping the gate, and blocking my way forward! I flip the gate back, and traverse the attic halls until I&#39;m outside!</p>
<p>I fall down to get to the second floor balcony!</p>
<p><a name=6></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Heading to the doorway, I make my way to the balloon room again. This time, the balloons around the center are moving! Easy enough...</p>
<p>The platform holding the chest comes down and I get a Wonder Essence!</p>
<p>I jump down the hole, and make my way upstairs again! I head east, and jump down the chasm, where I&#39;m at the north end of the library!</p>
<p>A painting of a man and a woman are there, and a way east.</p>
<p>The next room has four suits of armor, and a chest on a high ledge here!</p>
<p>All of the suits are mummies!</p>
<p>After taking care of them, the door south opens, and I&#39;m back!</p>
<p>I head up again, and I backtrack to the room with the two press switches.</p>
<p>I break the blocks and the suit of armor behind them...</p>
<p>The suit of armor has a column in it!</p>
<p>I re-enter the room again and use the blocks as stepping stones to make sure I push the column from the other side, and push it to one of the switches! I press the second switch, opening the door southwards!</p>
<p>Leaving that room, I head east and into the bedroom with the six gargoyles!</p>
<p>A chest drops, and I get another key!</p>
<p>I head upstairs and south to the huge spiked ball hallway, and unlock the north door!</p>
<p>There&#39;s a huge block that&#39;s moving, with the small blocks stacked to block its way! In the center is a press switch, which pulls two small decorated pillars out of the way to reveal another press switch on a ledge.</p>
<p>The block moves counterclockwise. After a while, a jar drops down! I destroy all the square blocks asap to ensure that the jar drops after the block makes its way to its destination.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a column on the edge of the ledge I need to push to press the switch in the middle of the floor. I manage to push the column on the huge block and have it on the switch. </p>
<p>I now press the switch between the two columns...</p>
<p><strong>One of the barriers in the main hall are down! Yes!!!</strong></p>
<p><a name=7></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I make my (painful!) way to the top of the west clock tower, opening its door forward.</p>
<p>Pretty nice view here too! There are two gaps for me to jump down to, one at the south end, and an eastern gap near the top!</p>
<p>I jump off from the south gap, and press on a switch...</p>
<p><strong>Down goes the second barrier!</strong></p>
<p>I head inside, and make my way down!</p>
<p>There&#39;s a way to the east, and a set of stairs south!</p>
<p>I head east, then go back and take the south path, where a lever sits, which opens the way back to the base of the clock tower!</p>
<p>I go back and head to the eastern part of the room, and head south, which leads to the perches of the Shrine!</p>
<p>I climb another set of steps, and head inside, where I&#39;m now at the west wing hallway of the Shrine!</p>
<p>I head east and use a Spring Bean on a pod to create a shortcut back to the other side of the chasm.</p>
<p>But I head into one of the bedrooms near the pod in the hallway, which has a column and four barrels, and six press switches close together...</p>
<p>After a while, the switches rise!</p>
<p>Trying again, I push the column and carry the barrels to the switches, and press on the sixth one, dropping a chest of herbs!</p>
<p>I head west into the farther part of the hall, where I use a key to unlock a room there...</p>
<p>I&#39;m in a room of platforms, ledges, and more gargoyles!</p>
<p>After the gargoyles have been taken care of, I hit the lever at the base of the steep steps, moving the platforms to the other side!</p>
<p>I see a press switch on the southwest ledge...</p>
<p>I use the bombs and timing to ensure I hit the lever right!</p>
<p>I press the switch...</p>
<p><strong>Down goes the third barrier!</strong></p>
<p>But the gargoyles are back, and I flee west to the next room, which have the flame spouts again!</p>
<p>Tired, I give up for now, leaving that room...</p>
<p>At the main hall, I check my handiwork, only three more barriers to drop before facing Melzas!</p>
<p>I leave the Shrine, recover, and save back at the village.</p>
<p><strong>My god, this is a long and hard dungeon! The developers didn&#39;t screw around with this one, since it&#39;s the last one in the game!</strong></p>

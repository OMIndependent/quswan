<p>The sky turns dark and a voice calls to us: &quot;<strong>Releaser, come near to the resting place of those brave, perished souls...</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>I see a stone overlooking the graveyard, as it&#39;s glowing a blue light...</p>
<p>The stone moves and I enter its crevice...</p>
<p>It&#39;s Lars, the sealed wizard&#39;s, crypt!</p>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/lC8gZzFMKwM>Here&#39;s the music for the crypt.</a> Oddly enough, Lars is called Ra in the Japanese version of the game, probably to invoke the Egyptian sun god Ra.</p>
<p>I go downwards and read a plaque:
<strong>Those Who Lived Life For Others Shall Be Remembered In This Place</strong></p>
<p>I check out one of the plaques below, which reveals a St. Blue, who says that they &quot;never worship St. Green.&quot;</p>
<p>St. Green, the grave next to St. Blue, says, &quot;Brown respects my teachings more than is required.&quot;</p>
<p>Wait, is this another puzzle?</p>
<p>I check out the other graves, where White says their &quot;teachings are superior and surpasses all other teachings,&quot; Red&#39;s teachings are not as great as Blue&#39;s, and Brown says Red&#39;s teachings set the foundation for Green&#39;s.</p>
<p>I go up again and head into a room with a grave and a plaque, where a ghost appears and replies to me that I need to give the saints below &quot;proper respect&quot; in order to open the way forward.</p>
<p>I talk to the saints again.</p>
<p>There is a certain order in which they need to be spoken to. Hoo boy...</p>
<p>I read the notes I made on this blog again to find out which saint gets their respect first, and go through different combinations of saints.</p>
<p>I found out the order: <strong>White</strong>, <strong>Blue</strong>, <strong>Red</strong>, <strong>Green</strong>, and <strong>Brown</strong>.</p>
<p>I go back to the &quot;give proper respect&quot; ghost and I get &quot;five blessings from the saints!&quot;</p>
<p>I go back down again and the five saints open the doorway below. Their inscriptions are now blank!</p>
<p>Pretty odd puzzle, and it&#39;s gotten me wondering all of the histories these saints have with each other.</p>

<hr>
<p>I go down to a pit with two more plaques.</p>
<p>I read the first plaque, which says &quot;Here rests Alundra.&quot; That&#39;s...creepy. After reading the second plaque, which had the same thing as the first one, two zombies and two reapers jump down!</p>
<p>After that fight, where I threw jars at the reapers, sparkles appear on the raised platform, the same ones that restored my health last time. Instead, this one opens a bridge to the other side of the room.</p>
<p>The plaques here have also turned blank!</p>
<p>The chests on the other side contain two herbs.</p>
<p>In the next chamber, more puzzles await! After exploring around, I fall in a hole where a platform, two lever switches, and more zombies await!</p>
<p>These zombies dash super fast, and their cries are sort of screechy! Not gratingly so, but unsettling for me.</p>
<p>I now head back upstairs, where a glowing symbol floor (the same one from the mines) and a chest containing herbs are. A spiked ball in the west chamber drops, and opens a hole in the floor!</p>
<p>I move forward, pressing on a switch opening the gate to the entrance of the chamber.</p>
<p>There were also two more plaques, reading &quot;<strong>Left is Left, Right is Right. That truth lifts one thru darkest night,</strong>&quot; and the other plaque read something about the sun and the shadow that is angry at the sun, or something.</p>
<p>I go back to the hole that the spiked ball made, and use a barrel to jump to a chest containing more herbs.</p>
<p>A smarter way to hit zombies, or any enemy in this game, is to throw stuff at them.</p>
<p>I wander around the room and the basement lake below for awhile.</p>
<p>After all of that trouble, I step on the symbol and save my progress.</p>

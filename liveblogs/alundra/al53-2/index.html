<p>I&#39;m back, I&#39;m ready to play Alundra, and chew bubble gum! And I&#39;m out of bubble gum!</p>
<p>After exiting the portal, I go into the left stone foot of the Nirude statue.</p>
<p>The goblins run away from us! They also say &quot;Dharmaka!&quot; a lot!</p>
<p>I head to the right and collect a chest of herbs near a golem statue!</p>
<p>I use the superbad Power Glove to move the golem statue back at the entrance, and head up.</p>
<p><strong>Goblin:</strong> &quot;You will not succeed infidel! Behold, even your life seconds are numbered!&quot;</p>
<p>The goblin pulls the vertical lever up, and more of the sludgy bug mudmen drop down! I equip the fire wand, which has a good range, to take care of them with fire!</p>
<p><strong>Goblin:</strong> &quot;Dharmaka! Try this on for size!&quot;</p>
<p>Those glowing eyed stone heads drop down from the ceiling!</p>
<p>After breaking them, I head upstairs!</p>
<p>I&#39;m now near a big pit with a moving platform north of me, a spiked ball above, and some barrels. I carry a barrel and jump on the static cracked platforms!</p>
<p>I jump over the ledges, going clockwise around the room.</p>
<p>I realize that I needed to get another barrel to jump over the gap to the northeast passage.</p>
<p>Even putting the barrel on one of the cracked platforms breaks them too!</p>
<p>I manage to throw a barrel on the moving platform.</p>
<p>With a few tries, I make my way forward by throwing the barrel on the top ledge, trying to head back on the moving platfrom.</p>
<p>Ah, spiked balls are <strong>really</strong> not my favorite things to see!</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I finally manage to get to the next passage, where four goblins, one red, and three blue, are on a high ledge, pulling a switch on the left.</p>
<p>More bug mudmen drop down to the party!</p>
<p>Reinforcements continue to drop!</p>
<p>Well, at least they stopped coming after the fourth group! No wait, there&#39;s more of them!!!</p>
<p>I head back to the previous chamber, and go back again, where the four goblins are! They press the switch on the right, opening the staircase up to them. Whoops!</p>
<p>There&#39;s a bed of spikes east of me, a moving platform, and a press switch, which drops a barrel!</p>
<p>I head downstairs, where there are five press switches, and five golem statues there. Simple enough...</p>
<p>Except the golems have to be pushed in a certain way (left or right only), and only once!</p>
<p>The block on the top right corner lifts itself up, as I head downstairs!</p>
<p>I&#39;m now at the same room where I first entered Nirude&#39;s Lair way back! I jump and grab the two chests, which have herbs and a key.</p>
<p>I push the golem blocking the tunnel in the cave and move forward.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a barrel and a press switch opening the tunnel forward. I position the barrel carefully, not too close to the ledge or the switch while still having the barrel press the switch.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a chest at the edge of a lake. I open it, and I get a Gilded Falcon!</p>
<p>I head outside, where I&#39;m now at the entrance before the statue&#39;s right foot.</p>
<p>I head back inside the lair!</p>
<p>I use the key to open the small gate near the place with the two switches where I got ambushed by those mud monsters!</p>
<p>I&#39;m now outside again, in between the statue&#39;s legs...</p>
<p>Boulders block my way upstairs, so I head in the entrance at the foot of the stairs.</p>
<p>The goblins are surprised at my arrival and activate the stone heads that dot the floor of the chamber!</p>
<p>In front of me, I see a save teleporter! I head in, recover, and save!</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I now head out and climb the right side, after seeing the left side&#39;s ladder is broken!</p>
<p>A track of fireballs block my progress upwards, but after a few hits, I make it to the statue head, and the use the bow to bring it down!</p>
<p>The head usually spits out two fireballs at a time. Using the delay, I take care of the stone head.</p>
<p>I drop back down to the base and use the pillar to get to the left side, and climb to hit the lever switch at the top.</p>
<p>I climb upwards and am now in a room with a big chasm in the south end, and a set of pushable columns.</p>
<p>I push the center column, where it falls into the chasm, breaking it, and I jump down.</p>
<p>I push the golem to get in a tunnel where I see a sign, four press switches, where two are active because golems are on top of them.</p>
<p>I read the sign, where it says the engine room is below this chamber. To activate the engine, the switches have to be pressed: left, right, left, left, right, right.</p>
<p>There are blocks on the opposite ends of the hall.</p>
<p>I head back up and up the stairs in the room with the chasm, where I&#39;m in front of a huge spike bed, moving platforms, which aren&#39;t moving, and a sign, which says I need to activate something to proceed: &quot;press each lever once then twice in alternating order...&quot;</p>
<p>The small holes in the wall are probably for goblins only.</p>
<p>I head back to the room with the four press switches, and press all of them to open the passages below.</p>
<p>I take the right staircase down to the sealed off engine room. There are two press switches, one in each side of the engine and two levers below the engine.</p>
<p>I press one of the switches, opening the gate on the opposite end, and closing it quickly!</p>
<p>This puzzle is testing my running reflexes!</p>
<p>I read the guide again, and it told me that the sign above was actually right, but the sign mentioned levers, instead of the press switches I see here...</p>
<p>I press the switches in the order the sign said, activating the engine!</p>
<p>After recovering and saving, I head back up to the spike bed chamber.</p>

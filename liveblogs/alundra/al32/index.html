<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>I hear some clanging downstairs, Jess is making something again.</p>
<p>Is that a bow and arrow!?</p>
<p><strong>Jess:</strong> &quot;This is much like the one Kline used...except it shoots a little farther. No big whoop. Try it, Alundra. You&#39;ll like it. In fact, I think you&#39;ll need it!&quot;</p>
<p>We get the <strong>Hunter&#39;s Bow!!!</strong></p>
<p>Jess says there&#39;s a giant lizard living in the swamp southeast of Inoa, and says if the Murgg attack, so will the lizard.</p>
<p>I save my progress at this point and head out.</p>
<p>This game...<strong>this game</strong>...I mean, all of those hard puzzles, and all of that effort to rescue someone from their dreams, and they still die!</p>
<p>I wander around the village and the map, looking for some stuff I might have missed.</p>
<p>I try the bow and arrow. Lucky that there&#39;s infinite ammo! But it doesn&#39;t cut shrubs, so I switch back to the sword.</p>
<p>I see a chest east of Merrick&#39;s House, and I try to reach it. With no luck, I go to Nava&#39;s Cabin and swim west, also no luck there too.</p>
<p>Wandering around some more...</p>
<p>I head to the left house near the coal mine, and I head upstairs, where I meet Kohei, a self-proclaimed &quot;acclaimed composer.&quot; He mentions other composers like Jonas Tesh, Riccardi Marxus... (John Tesh, Richard Marx, lol! <del>The links go to the songs these two artists did.</del>)</p>
<p>I stand near the phonograph, and listen to some music from the game. It&#39;s only 8 tracks of the music so far.</p>
<p>There are three other empty tables, I&#39;m betting those might be for other music pieces later in the game...</p>
<p>I head into the cave where I first met the blue slimes. With the Merman Boots, I swim over and grab the second chest, which contains...a Wonder Essence, which I already have, so I can&#39;t take it.</p>
<p>I swim further north of where the chest is, and land on the dock and head up, fighting off more blue slimes as I head further east and exit.</p>
<p>Now I&#39;m at the western part of the lake, where a stone pedestal asks for an <strong>Emerald Crest.</strong></p>
<p>Behind a set of bushes, I see a chest, which is actually a Mimic!</p>
<p>This Mimic moves fast, lucky he takes three hits to take care of!</p>
<p>I go back into the cave again, and head out, looking for more places to explore.</p>
<p>The cave where I first got the Wonder Essence is next!</p>
<p>But first I head to the Sanctuary, where I try to use a bomb to activate a lever located on the other side of potted plants. No good.</p>
<p>I try the bow, which works! The door south opens, which is a library! I read the tomes, or at least try to. I find a wide gap between two books in one of the shelves. With nothing else, I look around the Sanctuary.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>After a while, I leave it and head up to that cave. Unlike in Zelda, the arrows can&#39;t hit enemies! Or actually they do, but the slimes are too short to be hit by the arrow.</p>
<p>I jump into the teleporter on the water, and I see three chests on shore.</p>
<p>One of them is a Mimic!</p>
<p>The top chest has 30 gilders! I now have 1000 gilders, yes!</p>
<p>The bottom chest has a Gilded Falcon inside.</p>
<p>Now I explore some more...</p>
<p>Cephas the Gravekeeper warns me about the swamp southeast.</p>
<p>On the way, I activate another portal:</p>
<p>--The area north of the Cemetery, outside Magyscar</p>
<p>That&#39;s now six portals unlocked...</p>
<p>I save my progress here.</p>
<p>I head back out and check out the shrine of Magyscar and head west into the lake. I jump off the bridge and head to the island where the last Crest pedestal lies, which needs a <strong>Garnet Crest</strong>. Hmmmm...</p>

<p>After getting the Gilded Falcon from a chest north of the Garnet Pedestal, I go back into the water and head south, letting the river take us far...</p>
<p>Down to the waterfalls...</p>
<p>Under a bridge, into a whirlpool, but I dodge that and swim west of the fork instead.</p>
<p>I land ashore where more orcs with maces greet me hello!</p>
<p>I wander around the temple-like ground, until I reach a chest containing a Gilded Falcon. I dive back into the river again.</p>
<p>So much places to explore!</p>
<p>I wander again and find another portal, making it seven portals that I&#39;ve unlocked.</p>
<p>I head south, but it&#39;s a dead end!</p>
<p>But I see another dock, so I double back and dive from it.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a huge manor on top of the cliffside, but the way is blocked by thorns and huge trees!</p>
<p>I swim back, and after a few waterfalls down, I&#39;m now back on the beach!</p>
<p>Exhausted after that adventure, I buy herbs from Naomi and save at Jess&#39;s house.</p>

<p>I read a sign saying that to open the Sluice Gate, both levers need to be pulled at the same time.</p>
<p>I turn back, knowing it&#39;s impossible, and I think we might get a friend in-game along to do this.</p>
<p>The guide I read says that at this point, the Riverside Pub and the Centurius XXI house near the beach is open.</p>
<p>I go in to the Riverside Pub, or the bar, as it should be called.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQICnojdhGI">Here&#39;s the music for that place.</a></p>
<p>I talk to one of the pirates who says I shouldn&#39;t be here, he even says he shouldn&#39;t be here either. So, why are you there then, pirate?</p>
<p>Like this game, roulette is addicting!</p>
<p>I refuse a drink from a pirate and he mentions me &quot;sucking on mama&#39;s milk,&quot; where he explains his pathetic mama&#39;s milk joke!</p>
<p>One&#39;s busy drinking to forget how much money he&#39;s lost.</p>
<p>This is one wretched hive of scum and villainy indeed!</p>
<p>Everyone wants Alundra to drink milk, wish they had chocolate milk though!</p>
<p>I leave and go in to the Centurius XXI house, where the sign now says, &quot;The Medallion,&quot; a curio shop.</p>
<p>Wait, is that...it is! It&#39;s Captain Merrick! Who&#39;s now already selling stuff after the shipwreck changed his mind about adventuring the high seas.</p>
<p>Everything in this shop is worth 10,000 gilder! The Life Vessel there is also worth 10,000!</p>
<p>Olga&#39;s Ring, a Recovery Ring, and a Silver Armlet are also on sale.</p>
<p>Now I wish we had a bigger wallet in the game...</p>
<p>I head to Nava&#39;s Cabin, where Nava is trying not to speak in vague half-sentences but does anyway. He mentions a person named Vul.</p>
<p>Thank goodness for these Long Boots! I jump up to a ledge with a chest which has a Strength Tonic, which I have. Why can&#39;t I keep at least nine of these? It might break the game, that&#39;s probably why.</p>
<p>I continue walking east on the beach until I reach a cave.</p>
<p>This is the Coastal Cave I&#39;m in.</p>
<p>There are now more fire-breathing rock turtles and small square blocks here!</p>
<p>I progress further in the cave, and get a chest of herbs. However, the rest of the way is blocked by lots of rocks and high ledges!</p>
<p>I turn back and head to Jess&#39;s to save.</p>

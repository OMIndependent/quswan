<p>Oh my god, Nava&#39;s gone!</p>
<p>The staircase heading down that he&#39;s been guarding might lead to where he is!</p>
<p>I&#39;m now in a cavern, in Nava&#39;s Keep. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIBtppRKT9w">My favorite piece of music from Tarn&#39;s Manor plays here again!</a></p>
<p>I now head south where I walk across the shallows and fight more slimes!</p>
<p>Those jumping spiders with the stingers are back too!</p>
<p>There are three tunnels in front of me. Which one will take me ahead?</p>
<p>I go to the center tunnel.</p>
<p>I&#39;m now in a place with more spiders and ledges! At the base are three tunnels. I go left.</p>
<p>Bug mudmen and cracked platforms are here too! It takes two hits or one charged hit from the sword to take the mudmen out!</p>
<p>Some of the areas have holes, other ones crevices leading into tunnels. I go to the middle hole.</p>
<p>More jumping spiders and tiny platforms on various heights await here! Three more tunnels. I head right.</p>
<p>I&#39;m now near a pool of water with fish underwater. I head to the middle.</p>
<p>I&#39;m back at the bug mudmen and cracked platforms area. I head right, taking me back to the first area with the three tunnels!</p>
<p>I&#39;m now in front of a cliffy area, with more spiders and three tunnels! A stray barrel is near the top of this area! I go into the middle tunnel.</p>
<p>Five bug mudmen greet me here, and I take the middle tunnel to proceed.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Dammit, I&#39;m back at the beginning again!</p>
<p>I head left, then right, now I&#39;m at another pool, with a big platform at the north end that&#39;s not moving. I head to the middle, taking me back to another visited area!</p>
<p>This keep is a maze!</p>
<p>Back at the cracked floors and bug mudmen room! I head left this time!</p>
<p>I&#39;m now looking down at a deep quarry with a high ledge in the center. No enemies here! I head to the center tunnel.</p>
<p>After a trek and a half, I make it to the shallow water where a set of unlit pillar orbs are flanking a staircase to a center tunnel. I go to the left tunnel.</p>
<p>I&#39;m back at the entrance! Aaaaaaaahhahhsakshfjsdkjhfhaksdfk!</p>
<p><strong>This maze is so confusing!</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;m now in a passage where there are the usual three tunnels ahead, a huge cave, and two secret passages on the left and right ends.</p>
<p>There&#39;s lots of passageways! Most of them move forward, while others go back!</p>
<p>I go to another passage with three tunnels northwards, and one on the west, and two on the east. I take the second east tunnel, where I&#39;m in a secret passage leading to chest full of herbs.</p>
<p>I head to the left tunnel.</p>
<p>After many painful and twisting crossings, I make it back to the pillar orb room. I try to get in to the sealed tunnel, which I am prompted to &quot;cast light into each chamber&quot; before going through. A loud, distant thump is heard. I head right.</p>
<p>There&#39;s now a pillar orb on top of the moving platform in the next chamber. I take care of the fish there, which lowers the platform. I hit the orb! I head to the center tunnel.</p>
<p>I hit one of the pillars in the next chamber with a barrel!</p>
<p>That&#39;s two, and there&#39;s probably twelve chambers total, so there&#39;s ten more to hit!</p>
<p>In another room, after taking care of more spiders, the tiny platforms raise, revealing two barrels, an orb pillar, and a chest with a Gilded Falcon inside! That makes four I&#39;ve hit so far!</p>
<p>Now six!</p>
<p>I now light the remaining pillar orbs and head back to the sealed center tunnel.</p>
<p>Now the tunnel opens!</p>
<p>I&#39;m now outside again, on a lush, lone island, where I see a glowing save teleporter, a lone cottage, and a chest above the cave entrance!</p>
<p>I warp into the teleporter, recover, and save!</p>
<p>I find a pot and use the Spring Bean to get to the chest, which has a Life Vessel!!!</p>
<p>My health is now maxed out to 46!!! Yes!!!</p>
<p>I save again before heading into the cottage...</p>

<p>Sierra&#39;s now afraid for Sybill, since her strange dreams have almost completely gone, ever since she &quot;returned&quot; home.</p>
<p>I&#39;m assuming Sybill pretty much does whatever she wants too...</p>
<p>Gustav, in his stupor, tells everyone in the village to go to hell.</p>
<p>Elene&#39;s still labeling us a &quot;demon,&quot; asking if we&#39;re going to kill her. She won&#39;t kill us, though...</p>
<p>Meia&#39;s in Myra&#39;s house, Ronan has been the &quot;victim&quot; of a clever deception though, Meia says.</p>
<p><strong>Meia:</strong> &quot;He is worshipping the very evil from which he believes the gods shall deliver us!&quot;</p>
<p>Myra&#39;s now depressed. So that makes it denial, anger, bargaining...she&#39;s going to end up joining Nadia soon... <img class=emojione alt=ðŸ˜Ÿ title=:worried: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/1f61f.png></p>
<p>Phineas has almost forgotten what peace feels like...</p>
<p>Bonaire hasn&#39;t dreamed at all since Nadia died...</p>
<p>Alundra tells Lutas that he is the next to die, according to Sybill&#39;s dream. He reacts the same way I would if I were given that notice...</p>
<p>Fein says Giles isn&#39;t too happy with us, more or less, that he&#39;s not too happy with himself.</p>
<p>Rumi thinks that without Alundra, Giles might have perished. The prayers to their gods may have gone unanswered...</p>
<p>Grandpa Wendell knows a devil is afoot!</p>
<p>Kisha&#39;s asking why the gods are punishing the villagers with death.</p>
<p>Nestus thinks Alundra might be leaving the village for good, and doesn&#39;t want to see him go...</p>
<p>Bergus thinks very highly of us.</p>
<p>Talis says that &quot;[we&#39;re] an inspiration to peasants everywhere! Fight the power!&quot;</p>
<p>Mayor Beaumont says that Giles praises us for saving his life, and assumed that we were the cause of the villagers dying. But he also praises us as well.</p>
<p>Thyea hasn&#39;t seen Ronan around.</p>
<p>Speaking of Ronan, it&#39;s time we paid him a visit...</p>

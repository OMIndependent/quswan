<p>I head downstairs where there are three games up for playing, one of them, Monster Shooting makes a nod to the movie <em>Speed</em>. Roulette and Slime Busters are the other three. I head to the Slime Busters game at the end of the room.</p>
<p>Get on with it, game clerk, and don&#39;t judge someone by the &quot;adrenaline oozing out of their pores!&quot;</p>
<p>I listen to the rules first, it&#39;s basically a Slime hitting game, and I have to hit a set number of them per round for 30 seconds.</p>
<p>The anti-cheating PSA on one of the posters sounds pretty deceiving.</p>
<p>I have three rounds at the Slime Mashers, and head into the Monster Shooting gmae.</p>
<p>&quot;Deepest condolences,&quot; my ass!</p>
<p>I try my hand at the Wheel of Fortune Roulette after trying thrice at the Slime Mashers again.</p>
<p>I read the rules of Roulette twice before diving in.</p>
<p>I count the number of colors on the &quot;wheel.&quot; There&#39;s 1/16 chance if I hit black, and 5/16 chance for everything else...</p>
<p>This is the Wheel of Hell...</p>
<p>I manage to win one round at the Wheel, which is 15 gilders.</p>
<p>I go back up to the bar, where the pirate offers Alundra a drink. I accept and it restores my health. The aftereffects are pretty hilarious, though, as Alundra dashes randomly around a chair, eventually hitting the wall, knocking himself out.</p>
<p>Out of wanting to get some more stuff after reading the map for the pub here, I go back into Slime Mashing.</p>
<p>After five rounds of painful Slime Mashing, I win 480 gilders and a Life Vessel!!!</p>
<p>My health is now at 36!!!</p>
<p>After all of that &quot;edgy&quot; fun, I stop here!</p>

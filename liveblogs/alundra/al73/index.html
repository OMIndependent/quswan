<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkY7AxkVFVI">The music here sounds nicer than Torla Mountain&#39;s, this could fit on the <em>Wild Arms</em> sountrack as an extra track or something...</a></p>
<p>The place looks so bluish here, with dark shrubbery and cool colored palace-like walls.</p>
<p>There are three green glowing goddess statues, and a save teleporter in the middle.</p>
<p>Meia now speaks to us.</p>
<p><strong>Meia:</strong> &quot;Though Nestus and Bergus are physically twins, <strong>they are almost exact opposites...If it&#39;s not clear now, it soon will be...</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>I move on ahead. This might be a <a href=http://banjokazooie.wikia.com/wiki/Hailfire_Peaks>Hailfire Peaks-like</a> dungeon probably...</p>
<p>The Murgg are in here too!</p>
<p>The fireball spout from the Giant Tree is also here with them.</p>
<p>I use it to jump to the high ledge, where there&#39;s an iron gate barring the way forward.</p>
<p>There are also iron gates on the west and east ways.</p>
<p>After taking care of the Murgg, the west iron gate opens!</p>
<p>As soon as I enter, four switches from each of the corners of the room click on, starting with the bottom left going clockwise.</p>
<p>A teleporter is in the middle of this room as well.</p>
<p>I warp to Bergus&#39;s mind where the room&#39;s layout is basically the same, except the switches are off, and the place has warmer, redder tones.</p>
<p>I am right! Aesthetically, it looks like Hailfire Peaks! Thank goodness there&#39;s no actual ice or lava here!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Since the twins are opposites, I activate the switches in the opposite order, from the bottom right going counter clockwise.</p>
<p>The gate north opens!</p>
<p>In the next room, a fireball goes around a ledge counter clockwise and poofs out!</p>
<p>I warp back to Nestus&#39;s mind and activate the switches there in clockwise order.</p>
<p>I now cross a bridge forward, and into a tower!</p>
<p>In the tower, I go down and exit right, as the way forward is blocked by a big block!</p>
<p>More Murgg above on a bridge. I head east, where I see a teleporter.</p>
<p>Now at Bergus&#39;s mind, I head east.</p>
<p>I see a barrel, throw it past the ledge, and lower the block there by hitting the switch.</p>
<p>The passage north is blocked by an iron gate!</p>
<p>In Nestus&#39;s mind, I activate the switch, opening the iron gate forward!</p>
<p>I head up and out the tower, where I&#39;m now walking on glass!</p>
<p>A stray barrel is here, and as I carry the barrel, another barrel past the mirror also moves with it too!</p>
<p>Now I have to move the barrel to the switch here while also luring its mirror to press it.</p>
<p>I succeed and the mirror breaks!</p>
<p>I head south and I&#39;m now in Bergus&#39;s mind!</p>
<p>I head down a set of stairs, activating a switch, which did something to one of the green glowing statues! The left one in Nestus&#39;s side vanished, and the right one on Bergus&#39;s side stopped glowing!</p>
<p>There&#39;s also a chest next to the right of the goddess statue in Bergus&#39;s dream.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I head down the left set of stairs, and I find myself in another passage.</p>
<p>I press the switch there, activating the moving platform there, and cross south, past the bridge.</p>
<p>I see a teleporter in the southwest corner with two switches next to each other in the middle of the room.</p>
<p>I press them, which only deactivates a second after stepping on them!</p>
<p>Warping to Nestus&#39;s dream, I&#39;m now playing another round of Simon!</p>
<p>There are nine patterns on the switches, this is gonna be a lot to memorize...</p>
<p><strong>R L L R L R R L R</strong></p>
<p>...that&#39;s the pattern, but it needs to be performed in the opposite order.</p>
<p>The gate south opens!</p>
<p>I&#39;m now in a room with four torches on different ledges!</p>
<p>The order they light up and douse is <strong>northwest, southwest, northeast,</strong> and <strong>southeast</strong>.</p>
<p>I use the teleporter there to warp to Nestus&#39;s side, where I light the torches in the opposite order.</p>
<p>After that&#39;s done, a chest drops, containing a key!</p>
<p>I go west, where I&#39;m now back near the entrance room!</p>
<p>I wander around the dungeon trying to find the locked door for the key.</p>
<p>I unlock the door at the room with the switch patterns, and head west from there.</p>
<p>I activate another switch south of a teleporter, which opens one of the iron gates above!</p>
<p>I warp to Bergus&#39;s Dream, and do the same thing there, then warp back.</p>
<p>Inside the east tower of Nestus&#39;s Dream now, where I cross over a platform and climb the stairs up to see another mirror puzzle.</p>
<p>This time, there are torches (in numbers) on the mirror side, and press switches (in letters) on my end, like so:</p>
<p><strong>a b c d</strong></p>
<p><strong>1 2 3 4</strong></p>
<p>The torches light up <strong>2, 4, 1, 3</strong>.</p>
<p>Like every other puzzle here, the switches when on douse the torches in opposite order.</p>
<p>Easy! The mirror breaks and I cross through!</p>
<p>I press another switch, which vanishes the right goddess&#39;s glow on Nestus&#39;s side, and the left on Bergus&#39;s.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I head to the other staircase, and make my way down.</p>
<p>I unlock the next set of iron gates forward in the center of the entrance hall in both Bergus and Nestus&#39;s dreams!</p>
<p>I warp to Nestus&#39;s dream and head into the center tower, and fight off the Murgg there!</p>
<p>Another mirror puzzle awaits!</p>
<p>This time, there are torches on both sides of this puzzle! Here&#39;s the diagram:</p>
<p><strong>a b c d e</strong></p>
<p><strong>1 2 3 4 5</strong></p>
<p>The order they light on my side is <strong>1, 3, 5, 2,</strong> and <strong>4</strong>.</p>
<p>I have to guide a fireball to light the mirror-side torches in the opposite order, just like how the previous mirror puzzles worked.</p>
<p>Crossing between torches, however, is a pain, as Alundra needs to be exactly between them!</p>
<p>I activate the final switch, dissolving the last goddess&#39;s green glow.</p>
<p>A teleporter now appears on Bergus&#39;s side of the entrance!</p>
<p>I noticed that there are two chests instead of one!</p>
<p>I head south, taking care of the boomerang-wielding Murgg and move forward!</p>
<p>I&#39;m now in Bergus&#39;s version of the entrance hall, where more Murgg lie waiting!</p>
<p>After taking care of them, all the gates open!</p>
<p>I open the chests, which have a Gilded Falcon, and a Life Vessel!!!</p>
<p>My health is now at 45, yes!!!</p>
<p>This is one of the easiest dungeons I&#39;ve faced!</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>After saving and fighting off more Murgg, I go back to Bergus&#39;s mind and warp to the exit!</p>
<p>Oh god, two giant versions of the potbellied gargoyles are here!</p>
<p>Each time I hit one, it affects the other! With this knowledge, I plan my attack!</p>
<p>They can strike at the same time, and can shoot a green gas liquid from their chests! They lunge so fast too!</p>
<p>They&#39;re easy to be hit, though, and I take care of the right gargoyle with the sword and water magic!</p>
<p>The <strong>Terror Twins</strong> are defeated!</p>
<p>I warp out of Bergus&#39;s head!</p>
<p>I&#39;m now I&#39;m front of a statue of Melzas, and Bergus is sleeping before it...</p>
<p>He wakes up, and Bergus explains that he was drugged by the Murgg to make him sleep as they jumped into his head!</p>
<p>Bergus also told me the ridiculousness of me walking out of his head.</p>
<p>Bergus also notices the Melzas statue here, but his eyes are closed, like he&#39;s asleep...it creeps Bergus out though, like the Sanctuary statue!</p>
<p>So that confirms the villagers actually know about the statue below the Sanctuary then...hmmm...</p>
<p>Now how do we get out of this cell?</p>
<p>I equip the flail to reach the switch on the other side of the wall, no good.</p>
<p>I accidentally hit the statue with the flail, causing the whole room to shake! With rubble falling down!</p>
<p>I do it again!</p>
<p><strong>Take this, you demonic asshole!</strong></p>
<p><strong>You taker of lives!</strong></p>
<p>Blood-red cracks and a fiery explosion later, I destroy Melzas&#39;s statue! The room is now shaking endlessly (and eternally)!</p>
<p>Bergus is scared to death now!</p>
<p>The door&#39;s now opened!</p>
<p>I&#39;m outside near the outskirts of the Giant Tree.</p>
<p>Bergus leaves for the village.</p>
<p>&quot;Murgg turd,&quot; well at least that&#39;s better than &quot;rotten egg.&quot; I hope I don&#39;t forget that.</p>
<p>I walk back to the hut, looking at the remains of Melzas&#39;s statue. The shaking&#39;s now stopped.</p>
<p>I&#39;m betting that Bergus was probably going to be a sacrifice for Melzas...</p>
<p>I save at the portal chamber. What I did might have affected the statue at the Sanctuary...</p>

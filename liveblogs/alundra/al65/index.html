<p>Now it&#39;s time to pay a visit to the white monkeys with wolverine claws!</p>
<p>It seems that Kohei has a new phonograph ready, meaning more music! I listen to the music.</p>
<p>Getting into the Murgg Woods is a bit tricky though...it involves jumping through many pillars and cliffs north of the Fire Manor area, near the underground tunnel where the Mimics are!</p>
<p>Noticing that I&#39;m missing a Strength Tonic, I warp to the Cliffs and grab one in a chest near the waterfall.</p>
<p>After warping back and getting more money inside the Mimic Tunnel, I head to the Woods!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I use the Tree Gem to open the gate forward. It explodes in a bunch of green fireworks!</p>
<p>I head west, where a toadstool mushroom awakens! It shoots out spores, which I dodge promptly! I also see two chests hidden by a bunch of trees!</p>
<p>After jumping to a ledge in the east, I push the boulder there downwards, breaking the boulder below that&#39;s blocking another entrance to the Woods!</p>
<p>I read the sign there: </p>
<p>&quot;Murgg Woods<br>
Beware of Falling Simians!&quot;</p>
<p>I head forward, where there are two Murgg, a huge spiked ball at the edge of the cliff where they&#39;re standing, and a chest on a northern ledge.</p>
<p><strong>Murgg:</strong> &quot;Hrrg! Step back, furless one! The penalty for disobedience is death! Insolent furless one! Prepare to be flattened!&quot;</p>
<p>The Murgg push the spiked ball to our way. It misses big time. Alundra jumps a ledge higher, and the Murgg get a bit frightened. They run away.</p>
<p>I head back down and go in the tunnel there.</p>
<p>This part here was in one of the videos that I watched on YouTube which convinced me to play this game!</p>
<p>There&#39;s a press switch down at the chasm, and a chest at a high ledge north of it.</p>
<p>Uh oh! More Murgg! They mock us by saying that humans can&#39;t resist touching strange switches! And they call down four mushrooms! Looks like these guys are more savvy than I give them credit for.</p>
<p>I spam the Fire Wand to take care of them, and a pillar drops down!</p>
<p>I head outside, jumping many ledges, then down to a second tunnel east of my location.</p>
<p>A levitating spiked ball is on the left ledge, guarding a switch.</p>
<p>I press the switch, revealing big floating platforms. After dodging spiked balls, the end of the room has a tunnel covered by rubble. A single bomb takes care of that!</p>
<p>The Murgg gather more troops!</p>
<p>The Murgg archers keep hitting me a lot here!</p>
<p>After taking care of them, I head west where at the end of the road, I see a vertical lever. I press that, lowering the block on the higher ledge.</p>
<p>A movable block, however, bars my passage forward on the higher ledge!</p>
<p>There&#39;s more rumbling going on!</p>
<p>I cross into another passage, where I see a sturdy wooden bridge.</p>
<p>Oh devil, boulders now drop on the bridge! I watch my timing as I cross carefully!</p>
<p>On the other side, there are three chests, which contain herbs, money, and a Strength Elixyr.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I head back outside. After reading that guide again, I head back near the entrance, and walk west, close to the fence as possible to fetch the first chest that I saw earlier, which contain more herbs.</p>
<p>To get the second one, which is farther west, I may have to exit from that tunnel near it...</p>
<p>I go up east and north, burn a thorny bush and enter in a third tunnel. I&#39;m now at the place where I was, north of the movable block.</p>
<p>Seeing no way to push it, I head out and back into the second tunnel.</p>
<p>I&#39;m stumped!</p>
<p>I head back to the tunnel with the switch on the chasm and make it to the chest, which have only herbs!</p>
<p>More reading of the guide reveals that I have to hit the movable block with the new flail, which I do.</p>
<p>I head into the second tunnel again, and pull the vertical lever, and cross forward!</p>
<p>I pass through three moving spiked balls before finding the exit!</p>
<p>The next chamber has more mushrooms again near rocky ledges below! After taking care of them, the huge block disappears!</p>
<p>Oh no, I see more Murgg eating mushrooms!</p>
<p>They mention Reiner of the Swamplands before starting their attack!</p>
<p>This mushroom here, thank goodness, is pretty harmless.</p>
<p>I cross west past a few bridges and jars. In the south crossing, I see a Murgg running west.</p>
<p>I head east, following the twisting bridges into another passage, where a golem guardian lies!</p>
<p>He&#39;s still sleeping so I head back!</p>
<p>I go back to where that Murgg was heading to, which is north of the golem, but it&#39;s fenced off! I see a vertical lever and a chest west on the other side of the fence.</p>
<p>I head up north then west, where I see a stray lever at the corner tucked away at the bottom. I fall down to hit it, only to be greeted by more Murgg!</p>
<p>After taking care of them, I hit the lever, raising the block blocking the way forward!</p>
<p>I head down, the golden Murgg waiting below.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Murgg:</strong> &quot;He dares to enter our secret den! I must report this to Lord Zazan at once! The Stone Golem stands ready. Attack the invader and crush him without mercy!&quot;</p>
<p>Good. I head over to that chamber.</p>
<p>A shake and a rumble and the fight is on!</p>
<p>Seven or eight hits from the flail takes care of the Stone Golem!</p>
<p>I head north, where the chest has a Wonder Essence! I hit the lever near the chest there, destroying the block forward!</p>
<p>I&#39;m now outside, where the Murgg are questioning their captain if he&#39;s afraid of us, saying that Lord Melzas said that humans are, or should be, more afraid of them! They&#39;re shocked that we beat their golem and run off to tell Zazan!</p>
<p>A Murgg drops a chest on the way out! Lol.</p>
<p>I drop down the cliffside east after burning a few thorns in the way. I go in the tunnel, which leads me to the same area where the three spiked balls and the vertical lever are.</p>
<p>I head out again, down a staircase, where a chest lies...which contains a Life Vessel!!!</p>
<p>I make my way around, getting hit by fiery geysers, and head to the tunnel on the higher ledges. This might be the fifth tunnel I&#39;m going into, I think...</p>
<p>Inside are more Murgg! And some teleporter pads in other unreachable parts of the tunnel!</p>
<p>Outside again, as I open the chest that one of the Murgg dropped...and I get a bow upgrade, a <strong>Willow Bow!!!</strong> <img class=emojione alt=ðŸ˜ƒ title=:smiley: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/1f603.png></p>
<p>I find an arch portal, enter into it, and save my progress.</p>

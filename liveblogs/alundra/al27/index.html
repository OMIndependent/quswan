<p>I check the locked door again, and go back, hitting the vertical lever.</p>
<p>The switch opens the western passage.</p>
<p>More orcs and circling spiked balls, how fun!</p>
<p>I get a chest from the far end of the room on a small ledge, containing a Gilded Falcon!</p>
<p>More jar smashing and column breaking!</p>
<p>I go to the eastern passage, where I&#39;m greeted by more circling balls and rock turtle, alongside actual rocks that look like rock turtle shells!</p>
<p>I have to make sure the metal balls are at a certain point before I use it as a platform to jump over to the higher ledge...</p>
<p>After so many painful, missed attempts, we finally make it!</p>
<p>The next chamber has deep water, with spiked balls on the water again!</p>
<p>I see a chest and reach it by going to the shore on the other end, jumping on logs and stones to make it there!</p>
<p>Poor Alundra gets hurt a lot in this area here!</p>
<p>Because of a wide gap between the dock I&#39;m on and the dock on the treasure chest, I use a stray log from the shore in the south end to fill the watery gap, and make it through! The chest contains a Wonder Essence!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I head right, where more orcs make their territory!</p>
<p>I scout the water-filled part of the area, where there are more spiked balls, logs, small wooden docks, and a set of square blocks on the piece of land at the eastern end!</p>
<p>I double back to reset the room, and use the jars at the edge of the shore to jump to the next dock.</p>
<p>Now I have to jump diagonally to carry this stray log across.</p>
<p>A few tries later, I make it, and smash the square blocks surrounding the chest, containing a key.</p>
<p>Three spiked balls keep hitting me as I head back! I swear, this game, or this cove, does have a thing for them!</p>
<p>After recovering and saving near the old prison again, I open the locked door southwards.</p>
<p>Two chests are behind bars: a Strength Eliyxr and a Life Vessel!!!</p>
<p>Since I already have an Eliyxr, I can&#39;t take it!</p>
<p>Now I head downstairs to a long hall, where a boulder is on a platform. I press the switch north of it...</p>
<p>Boulder chase!!!</p>
<p>On the other end of the hall, I see another switch on a high ledge and a fancy block blocking the way right. One big spiked ball is moving above for some reason. There are also ledges north of it.</p>
<p>These gaps between these ledges are now getting wider!</p>
<p>I realize what I have to do with these boulders! I jump on them while they roll and use their height to reach the switch!</p>
<p>I go down more steps to a large lake of dark, shallow water.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>&quot;<strong>Thief! Infidel! You shall regret the mere thought of defiling this sacred ground! Now regret shall consume your thoughts as your soul is bled of what life remains in it!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Oh god, another boss battle, and its a disembodied blue eyed moaning face in the water!</p>
<p>A watery hand just came out of the lake! What is this boss?</p>
<p>The boss now rises out of the water, which looks like some three-faced watery blob! It&#39;s hard to describe!</p>
<p>It also shoots blobby bubbles too!</p>
<p>Oh my god, more hands come out of the water!</p>
<p>I use up a Wonder Essence!</p>
<p>I now put the sword and Earth magic to good use here!</p>
<p>(In Austin Powers voice) <strong>Why won&#39;t you die!?!!</strong></p>
<p>Now I&#39;m really dead!</p>
<p>This game may be a Zelda clone, but it definitely is a hard one!</p>
<p>I pick &quot;continue&quot; and I&#39;m now back at the last save point. After getting the Life Vessel again from the chest, I save and continue onwards.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I check my items again, just where they were...</p>
<p>I face the boss again with his spiel of thievery and threats.</p>
<p>I use the sword and its charging power to bring more damage to the boss!</p>
<p>Yes, I got him! I watch the fireworks. The boss&#39;s name, according to the prompt, is the <strong>Watcher in the Water!</strong> (Another Lord of the Rings reference?)</p>
<p>Someone calls out to Alundra as the Releaser: It&#39;s Vul, another wizard and one of the seven guardians!</p>
<p>He tells me not to take the Murgg or their threats lightly, as they have stolen a Crest in this cave! Boooo!</p>
<p>Vul offers us a <strong>Water Scroll</strong> as a consolation prize though.</p>
<p>Two chests drop, the one on the right is open, probably the Crest I was supposed to get...</p>
<p>The left chest contains the <strong>Water Scroll!!!</strong></p>
<p>Vul offers a teleporter back to the entrance, but I refuse since there&#39;s chests I missed!</p>
<p>The water magic is just three whirlpools spinning around Alundra!</p>
<p>I pick up the remaining chests, which are the Strength Eliyxr and herbs and leave this cave!</p>
<p>Nava&#39;s back to his grumpy self and I return to the village and save.</p>
<p>That was a long dungeon, and I&#39;m betting there are more harder and longer ones than this one...</p>

Or was it his spirit that was watching them fight?</p>
<p>But anyway, after two months of inactivity (sorry!), it&#39;s time to finish this! (<strong>Note:</strong> I wrote this part around June 6th)</p>
<p>Let&#39;s see...I&#39;m now in the portal chamber...</p>
<p>My magic meter&#39;s empty!</p>
<p>All I just need to do is get some supplies from Lurvy.</p>
<p>I buy and use up a Magic Elixyr, and get another one, along with herbs, and another Strength Tonic.</p>
<p>I accidentally drop an herb and Lurvy gets a bit cranky with me, telling me not to make a mess or he&#39;d take care of business on my butt or something like that!</p>
<p>Now, to the lake!</p>
<p>But, I realize that Cephas might have something for us! I warp near the Magyscar entrance and head to the graveyard.</p>
<p><strong>Cephas:</strong> &quot;Nava has gone, right?... You have taken care of him, haven&#39;t you, Alundra? You truly overflow with kindness, friend. If you go to the basement of my house, there is a treasure Nava would&#39;ve wanted you to have. Light the lamps starting with the <strong>upper left,</strong> then <strong>lower right, bottom left, center bottom, middle top, top right</strong>. I&#39;m certain you&#39;ll be quite pleased with the fruits of your labor...&quot;</p>
<p>I head down to his basement and use the Fire Wand to light the torches in the order he said.</p>
<p>A chest comes down!</p>
<p>I open it, revealing <strong>Nava&#39;s Charm</strong>, the last important item in this game!</p>
<p><strong>Nava&#39;s Charm</strong> increases defense and neutralizes certain elements, according to the description.</p>
<p>I now head for the lake!</p>
<p>I cut some shrubs on the way to warm up our sword arm!</p>
<p>I take care of a few orc giants and place the <strong>Diamond Crest</strong> in its pedestal!</p>
<p>A loud bang, and the whole area shakes up!</p>
<p>Something&#39;s rising from the lake...<strong>oh my god! The bridge to Melzas&#39;s lair is now revealed!</strong></p>
<p>I climb up the stairs.</p>

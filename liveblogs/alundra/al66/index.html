<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>This means all the portals in the entire map have been unlocked, yessss!!!</p>
<p>The <strong>Willow Bow</strong> is also chargeable too!! Let&#39;s see this thing in action! I try the bow on mushroom outside...the charge attack looks like a magical arrow from a show I&#39;m familiar with...</p>
<p>I head down the steps into another tunnel...</p>
<p>I&#39;m now in another part of the dungeon here, and it seems like I&#39;ll get locked in just at the next chamber. There&#39;s a Murgg there...</p>
<p><strong>Murgg:</strong> &quot;Welcome, furless one! Welcome to the end of your miserable life!&quot;</p>
<p>The Murgg shuts the gate behind me, and three more buddies jump down!</p>
<p>After taking care of them, the gate disappears!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, another Murgg halts my way back out!</p>
<p>&quot;Warm sticky life fluid!?&quot; Nice, but long euphemism. He explodes the wall on the east, where seven more Murgg join the fray!</p>
<p>The gate opens after taking care of all of them with the Fire Wand!</p>
<p>I head to where they came from, through the wall and use the teleporter to warp to...</p>
<p>...a room with three bridges, three big blocks, and six switches, two on each side of the three blocks. I&#39;m currently in the middle bridge.</p>
<p>I press the south switch, which does nothing, and the north switch there, lowering the rightmost block.</p>
<p>I warp forward, where I&#39;m in a room of jars! I head to a passage east of the pad, and warp with the next one!</p>
<p>A rumbling room! I warp back and fight the Murgg in the previous room.</p>
<p>I take care of another set of reinforcements plus one archer, and teleport using the northeastern pad in that room.</p>
<p>I&#39;m at the bridge to the right, where I press the switch there to raise the right block again.</p>
<p>I head south and press on that switch, which lowers the left and raises the middle block.</p>
<p>I warp to a chamber where a recovery triangle awaits. I step on it, and three Murgg drop down from the bridge in the room!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>After a few scrapes, I&#39;m now back outside near the arch portal, and after I burn more thorns on the other ledge, I jump forward.</p>
<p>Eventually, I make it to the second chest that I saw and open it, which has a Strength Tonic.</p>
<p>I head into the tunnel north of the chest.</p>
<p>It&#39;s the rumbling room I was warped to before!</p>
<p>The Murgg here keep on coming!</p>
<p>I warp to the top-right teleporter and I&#39;m at the left bridge of the bridge room this time. I press the north switch, raising the block here, and lowering the middle. </p>
<p>I then press the south switch, which lowers the left block.</p>
<p>I&#39;m now on the high part of the ledge in the middle of a Murgg wine banquet! And they&#39;re drinking monkey wine!</p>
<p><strong>Murgg:</strong> &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSs6DcA6dFI">We will guzzle no wine before its time...</a>&quot;</p>
<p>They&#39;ve spotted us!</p>
<p>After taking care of them, I head outside! I&#39;m now in the western part of the woods, which I crossed on the way to get the Tonic!</p>
<p>I head north and into the tunnel into a bed of dangerous mushrooms, and their spores!</p>
<p>Some of them are harmless, while the rest try to spore me out!</p>
<p>I head south into the tunnel, and cross the bridge to the teleporter.</p>
<p>I&#39;m now back at the bridge room, at the top bridge!</p>
<p>I should&#39;ve hit the top middle switch!</p>
<p>I escape outside and try again, fighting off the mushrooms on my way out!</p>
<p>I figure out the effect of all six switches in the bridge chamber.</p>
<p><strong>1...3...5<br>
A...B...C<br>
2...4...6</strong></p>
<p>1 - lowers B, raises A<br>
2 - lowers A<br>
3 - lowers C, raises B<br>
4 - raises A, B, and C<br>
5 - raises B and C<br>
6 - raises B, lowers A</p>
<p>After lowering all three blocks, I head back outside, and make my way to the portal chamber and save my progress!</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I go ahead and cross the top bridge to the other teleporter.</p>
<p>Now I&#39;m in a huge chamber. I&#39;m sensing a boss battle here...</p>
<p>Since there&#39;s no one here I move to the bridge eastward, but an army of Murgg stop me! One has a boomerang, while the other four have their claws!</p>
<p>They refuse to give their wine away to us &quot;furless ones&quot;! Alundra turns back but five Murgg archers drop down! Time for a ten-on-one battle!</p>
<p>Taking a lot of damage, I take care of all ten and head forward!</p>
<p>Now I&#39;m outside again as I walk down the ledges push a column east near the arch portal, a good shortcut back. Afterwards, I head east to open a chest containing another Gilded Falcon.</p>
<p>After saving again in the portal chamber, I head north to where the Great Tree stands!</p>

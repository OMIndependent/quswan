<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>Now to get back on track in the lair...</p>
<p>I&#39;m back in the room full of spikes as I hit the switch to turn on the moving platform.</p>
<p>I equip the flail this time and use it to hit the second lever. It works, revealing a second moving platform.</p>
<p>After that crossing, I go upstairs into a room with jiggling spiked balls in the water. Oh my goodness, there are plenty of jokes here ripe for telling!</p>
<p>I swim into the water avoiding the path of the spiked balls, making it to the shallows, where there are square blocks. Using them as stepping stones, I reach a switch on the wooden dock in the middle of the spiked balls and press on it.</p>
<p>When I climb up to the ledge, I see more flanking lizard statues, and a chest at the far end. I collect a Gilded Falcon from the chest.</p>
<p>I head up the staircase. I&#39;m now in a room full of lizard statues, with a gigantic statue behind them!</p>
<p>They glow green and they come to life!</p>
<p>After using my earth magic and sword to take care of them all, I examine the giant statue. Nothing happens, so I head back down.</p>
<p>I try again and I&#39;m now attacked again by the lizards! I die again, but my Wonder Essence saves me!</p>
<p>I try bombing the huge statue, which destroys it!</p>
<p>Back at the spike chasm, the huge statue blocking the way to the east of the staircase is now gone.</p>
<p>I read the sign near its place: &quot;Keep of the Twin Reptiles.&quot;</p>
<p>Hmmm...this means when I bombed the large statue, this one also exploded too!</p>
<p>I exit out of the lair and head back to that cavern where I met the blue slimes, or the cave leading to the west part of the Lake, and grab the Wonder Essence from the chest, and get more healing stuff!</p>
<p>I swear, there needs to be labels on these portals! I keep getting lost easily!</p>
<p>After saving, now I go onwards past where the statue used to be!</p>
<p>I see a triangle in the middle ahead and plenty of lizard statues blocking the way east...here I go!</p>
<p>I touch the triangle, which restores my health!</p>
<p>Only one of them spring to life, and they don&#39;t regenerate, thank goodness!</p>
<p>So I manage to take them out one by one and move forward! There&#39;s a set path in where I&#39;m supposed to go by how each one is a lizard or an actual statue.</p>
<p>Oh great! The way behind me explodes!</p>
<p>I move on ahead, where I see a &quot;deep fissure&quot; in the wall. I use a bomb to take it down. After three tries, the wall explodes, and a lot of shaking&#39;s going on!</p>
<p>Too bad I&#39;m greeted by ten lizards!</p>
<p>After taking care of them, I get a chest...containing a key.</p>
<p>The way back is open!</p>
<p>This may be a Zelda clone, but it is a hard one! Alundra can only carry 9 herbs, a Tonic, and an Elixyr, plus only one &quot;Fairy in a bottle,&quot; which means only 12 recovery items plus one &quot;Green potion,&quot; or one Magic Elixyr, can be carried at one time, that&#39;s how hard this game is.</p>
<p>I save my progress and try to figure out what this key opens to.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I use the key to open the passage north of the two staircases, leading to a recovery triangle, and a passage west.</p>
<p>I&#39;m now at that room with the huge lizard statue, and the flanking statues from the first teleporter that I took in the beginning of the lair.</p>
<p>I jump down from the cliff, and breathe deeply, since I sense a boss battle coming...</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>He that treads foolishly into our sacred keep shall perish with the pain of a thousand souls!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>The fight is on!</p>
<p>When the big stone lizard jumps, Alundra gets stunned!</p>
<p>Everytime I pick off a lizardperson, one jumps from a statue to take its place! Guess I&#39;ll have to take out the big stony one first!</p>
<p>Lucky he&#39;s easy to hit!</p>
<p>What the heck!? He&#39;s recovering!?</p>
<p>I use up a Wonder Essence, and after a hit from the earth magic, and sword, I watch the fireworks!</p>
<p>Defeated <strong>Reptilicus Maximus!</strong> Now everything turns to white...</p>
<p>&quot;I see it...You are the Releaser, Alundra.&quot;</p>
<p>Now I meet another wizard, who thinks of us as a rare find, and able to challenge Melzas himself.</p>
<p>Jeal, one of the seven guardians, introduces himself to us, where he says he was once a metalsmith who wanted to understand life&#39;s mysteries, and he sacrificed his human form to stop evil in the mortal realm.</p>
<p>He also states that defeating Melzas is also &quot;risking the end of reality itself!&quot; <strong>What?</strong></p>
<p>I jump back up to the perches, where the fences blocking the way to the treasures are gone, and I take the loot.</p>
<p>I get a <strong>Fire Scroll</strong> from the chest!!!</p>
<p>And a <strong>Sapphire Crest!!!</strong></p>
<p>I try the fire magic, which shoots fire at huge distances!</p>
<p>I now have fire magic, ho ho ho!!!</p>
<p>I go and leave the Reptile Lair behind.</p>

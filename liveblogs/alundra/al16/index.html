<p>The sandstorm&#39;s pretty strong here! And so&#39;s the quicksand trail! I&#39;m also walking very slowly because of the sand!</p>
<p>Uh oh, an orc with an axe and shield comes, but I dodge his hit and take care of business.</p>
<p>After taking care of another orc, I head up to higher ground and jump on top of the stone walls. I walk around the stone walls, crossing carefully around the area.</p>
<p>Those worms that are rising and burrowing aren&#39;t sandworms...</p>
<p>I find another chest with 30 gilders on the western part of the desert.</p>
<p>I go back to the higher ground with pillars, and then, two tornadoes take me somewhere!</p>
<p>I turn back to reach another chest near an obelisk in the east, which has a Gilded Falcon.</p>
<p>This is not my favorite level!</p>
<p>I wander around and move westward in the area, until I see a cave! I head in there, jumping down to the sands. I go further down and find a chest containing a <strong>Sand Cape!!!</strong></p>
<p>So the Sand Cape allows me to burrow under the sand, huh?</p>
<p>I try it out on the crawl space I saw at the cave&#39;s entrance as I burrow down, and it works!</p>
<p>I go back to the place where the two tornadoes were and use the cape, heading west. It takes me back to the entrance again!</p>
<p>I use the cape to reach a chest in the eastern part of the desert, which contains herbs!</p>

<hr>
<p>I go back to where the tornadoes took me and like what Sybill said, I have to follow the wind, blowing north. Talking about the wind like this reminds of this guy from this anime I watched recently...</p>
<p><img src=http://s12.favim.com/orig/160213/anime-boy-gif-prince-of-stride-Favim.com-3989982.gif alt="kuga the wind" width=360 height=202></p>
<p>I&#39;m now at a canyon full of rocks and short cliffs. I follow the wind again, which now blows west as I try to make it to the western part of the area.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a set of small pillars and the wind&#39;s blowing south. If I try to head north though, the wind pushes me back down sometimes. I need to be careful here.</p>
<p>I make it and am now at a place with pillars and a set of steps in the middle, leading to some sparkling ground at the top of the steps.</p>
<p>I go through!</p>
<p>Sybill mentioned that after following the wind, I would be at a Sanctuary. I didn&#39;t expect rain though!</p>
<p>The main room has some cacti, a skeleton, a throne, two sets of staircases, and some worms from a distance!</p>
<p>I examine the area. There&#39;s lots of locked doors, a switch in the eastern room, and lots of statue busts.</p>
<p>Heading up the stairs, I see a glowing transporter in the middle (a save and recovery point yes!) and save my progress.</p>
<p>Oh my god, this was such a long level to play and a long and difficult one to write about!</p>

<p>I&#39;m back, and it&#39;s the 50th part of my playthrough of <strong>Alundra!</strong> I didn&#39;t expect the game to be this long!</p>
<p>I now do some more treasure hunting around the map again!</p>
<p>I can also use a charge attack with the Fire Wand too!</p>
<p>After lifting a stone, I&#39;m now inside the wall in the area north of the Fire Manor area.</p>
<p>I head to the left fork, where a Mimic awaits at the end! I burn the bed of thorns on the right fork, heading downstairs.</p>
<p>There&#39;s lots of Mimics in this cave!</p>
<p>The good thing about these monsters is that they drop more money whenever I hit them, ranging from 1 - 30 gilders per hit!</p>
<p>I get some herbs in a chest!</p>
<p>Now I&#39;m at the bottom of the cavern, where there are fancy blue vases, and more treasure!</p>
<p>The left chest is a Mimic, the right has a Magic Elixyr, and the center chest has a Life Vessel!!!</p>
<p>My health is now maxed up to 31!!!</p>
<p>I use the Spring Bean on the pots to bounce back up, but not before collecting a Gilded Falcon!</p>
<p><a href=http://vgmaps.com/Atlas/PSX/Alundra-Shack.png>Here&#39;s the map for that cave, and the area north of the Fire Manor.</a></p>
<p>Here are the treasures I&#39;ve collected so far:<br>
--A Gilded Falcon near the waterfall around the Coal Mine area<br>
--A Strength Elixyr on a high cliff in the Mt. Torla area</p>
<p>I look through the guide (thank you again, to whoever wrote it!) and find out that a stray bed of thorns was covering up a hidden path eastward in the Mt. Torla area.</p>
<p>After going through lots of greenery through that path, I jump down to a temple surrounded by trees where a thornbed is covering an entrance. I burn off the thorns and head in.</p>

<hr>
<p>It&#39;s the Ice Manor, and the devious sliding ice pillars from Kline&#39;s Dream make their return!</p>
<p>I check the room...there are three switches and six pillars total, and the switches need to be pressed at the same time.</p>
<p>Make that five switches, as I push the two middle pillars standing on them out of the way.</p>
<p>Out of my own silly need to prove myself, I dive into this puzzle without reading the guide.</p>
<p>I approach this puzzle like I would a chess game...hmmm...</p>
<p>After getting nowhere with this puzzle, I head out and save in the portal chamber and I stop the game...</p>
<p>At least three hours later, using my chess set as a simulator for this puzzle, I think I seem to have this puzzle down.</p>
<p>Honestly, this is one of the hardest puzzles I&#39;ve ever faced so far! It takes me 11 careful moves to have the pillars press all four switches, and me pressing the fifth one to open the door forward.</p>
<p>I&#39;m now in a room with four short flights of stairs and three passages at the top.</p>
<p>I take the left one, activating the turn lever right, but the lever does not want to move.</p>
<p>I go to the right passage, same problem.</p>
<p>After a little back and forth, I use the sword instead of the flail and the switch responds.</p>
<p>In the middle passage, there are four iron gates. After moving the switch right, the second and fourth gates open.</p>
<p>I manage to turn the left lever south and the right lever west to open all the gates.</p>
<p>Frack, more ice pillars! I head back and save again to think over this one more!</p>
<p>There are six ice pillars like the first one, but there is a short ledge that is in between the bottom row of pillars.</p>
<p>On a high ledge in the north end is a treasure chest. If I solve this puzzle, I&#39;ll get it. But that&#39;s one big &quot;if&quot; since this is so difficult!</p>
<p>I go back to that room, and have a few tries at it to know how to make sure I reach the ledge and grab what&#39;s in the chest.</p>
<p>Thank goodness the puzzles in the manor stay solved!</p>
<p>After a while, I stop the game to figure out how to solve this puzzle...</p>

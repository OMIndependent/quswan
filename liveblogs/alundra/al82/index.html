<p>The Lake Shrine!</p>

<p>I climb up the stairs and see double doors with skulls embedded on the door frames!</p>
<p>I head left, crossing the perimeter of the Lake Shrine. It&#39;s a beautiful place. I notice trees inside the walls.</p>
<p>After seeing a dead end, I head right. There&#39;s a big pit of water at the gap below. I jump down, and swim into the corridor ahead.</p>
<p>Oh god, the gray versions of those tentacle creatures from Elene&#39;s dream are here!</p>
<p>I see a bunch of barrels, which I use to jump to the ledge where they are.</p>
<p>I take care of them, and look at my options.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a tunnel leading outside south and a set of stairs north. I head out.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a barricade, and a set of press switches here, and two blue versions of the potbellied gargoyles on the other side.</p>
<p>I head upstairs, the Reapers are back with a gargoyle friend!</p>
<p>A wall prevents me from going further!</p>
<p>I take care of a gargoyle, opening a door south of the room!</p>
<p>After using an arrow to shoot the lever on the other side of the wall, the wall lowers!</p>
<p>The Reapers are easy pickings as I exit outside.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, offline life forces me to hold this off for breakfast, so I shut off the game without saving!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Okay, after doing all of what I did in the first part again, I&#39;m finally back on track!</p>
<p>Difference is this time, I save in the portal chamber after I get <strong>Nava&#39;s Charm!</strong></p>
<p>I now cross the walkway outside to get to the east wing tower, where a gargoyle and Reapers await.</p>
<p>After taking care of the gargoyle, the wall blocking the way to the stairway lowers!</p>
<p>I head to the west passage instead.</p>
<p>I cross the wall, where I see three buzzing, flaming barriers blocking the stairway west, with three chests floating north of them, and two levers.</p>
<p>I hit the right lever, lowering the rightmost chest, a Mimic!</p>
<p>I hit the left one, lowering the center chest, another Mimic!</p>
<p>I hit the right lever again, lowering the leftmost chest, where I get a key!</p>
<p>I go back to the east tower and head downstairs.</p>
<p>Two of the three passages are closed shut with a huge steel gate, the west passage and the passage downstairs.</p>
<p>Three tentacle creatures are down there near the second closed passage. After taking care of them, I throw the crates.</p>
<p>I use the key to open the downstairs passage. I head upstairs to an open passage first.</p>
<p>I&#39;m now south of the barricaded room!</p>
<p>These gargoyles here are quick at warping!</p>
<p>After taking care of them, I throw a nearby barrel to the other side of the barricade to one of the switches. I press the other switch. I hear a rumble...</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>In the distance, a door can be heard creaking open...</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>I head upstairs, out, and downstairs back to the east tower, where the passage west of the staircase has shifted out of the way...</p>
<p>I head to the west passage.</p>
<p>A flaming, buzzing circle barrier blocks my way forward though!</p>
<p>I use the key to unlock the second passage and head into it.</p>
<p>Barriers block my way to the other side, where there are those bird head fireball statues moving side to side, with a floating steel turtle shell at the end, and a chest tucked in a corner.</p>
<p>I shoot the shell with an arrow, destroying the barriers!</p>
<p>I grab the herbs from the chest and head back to the passage west!</p>
<p>There&#39;s a press switch west of the barrier, which I try to turn on, but I get a message: &quot;<strong>The rusty chain has fused and cannot be moved.</strong>&quot; <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>I go up and cross the wall to the stairs in another tower.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>More barriers buzzing here, except they&#39;re blue, and they&#39;re guarding two chests.</p>
<p>I walk to the west tower, where I take care of the gargoyle and Reapers, lowering the wall barring the stairs down. I head down.</p>
<p>I go to a passage west, where I take care of more Reapers, and see two press switches flanking a doorway, two sets of columns, and more buzzing barriers.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a hidden passage I cross, which the end of it is blocked by a wall.</p>
<p>I go back to that passage, pushing the column, heading west and north to another chamber.</p>
<p>More tentacle blobs!</p>
<p>I press a switch, opening a gate east on a high ledge!</p>
<p>I go back a passage and head to the open gate.</p>
<p>Heading upstairs, I find myself in a room with two chests, one west of the column blocking me, and another surrounded by spiked balls in the south perch!</p>
<p>I hit the lever on the perch with my arrow, no good!</p>
<p>I hit the lever with the flail twice, but I end up teleported to the previous room!</p>
<p>I backtrack a bit to another east passage, where a buzzing barrier bars my way forward!</p>
<p>I head back upstairs to see if I can hit the lever with the flail without getting kicked to the downstairs area.</p>
<p>No good. I double back all the way to the west tower, and head to its north passage.</p>
<p>If I could take pics of this place, this would be easier to explain...</p>
<p>I cross the wall where I&#39;m now at the south perch, where spiked balls, and a Mimic lay dormant!</p>
<p>I hit the lever that I tried to activate from the staircase there, lowering the column in the north stairway.</p>
<p>Backtracking, I grab a key from the chest there, and open the doorway to the next passage.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Alright, time to break these barriers!</p>
<p>These bird head statues are quicker than the previous ones!</p>
<p>My archery really sucks at this point!</p>
<p>Just remember, this is all about the timing...I take a deep breath.</p>
<p>With a stroke of luck and lots of arrow spamming, I hit the shell, destroying the blue barriers!</p>
<p>I open the chest, getting more herbs!</p>
<p>Backtracking to the two chests near the stairway at the west guardhouse, I receive herbs and a key.</p>
<p>I head back to the west tower, and go downstairs and go to the east.</p>
<p>Two steel doors block the way. I use up one key to unlock the door.</p>
<p>It seems that the chamber with the two press switches might get me the other key...</p>
<p>I take care of the Reapers, and carry the barrel through the hidden passage to one of the press switches.</p>
<p>A chest drops down, giving me the second key.</p>
<p>I head back to that room.</p>
<p>After opening the steel door, I press the switch there!</p>
<p>I get the same &quot;rusty chain is fused&quot; message. Maybe if I strike the chain...</p>
<p>Two strikes seem to do the job!</p>
<p>I head back to the east tower, doing the same thing to the chain there!</p>
<p>After pressing the switch, the front gate is open!</p>
<p>Now, how do I get out of here?</p>
<p>I see a gap in the rail between the center guard towers!</p>
<p>I jump down and leave the Shrine to the portal chamber to save and stop here before going inside Melzas&#39;s inner sanctum proper and <strong>stopping him once and for all!</strong></p>

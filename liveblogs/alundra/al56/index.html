<p>Now that I have the Aqua Cape, I start to try it out using it on the whirlpools near the Pond.</p>
<p>I head out to the portal near the Pond.</p>
<p>I jump over the bridge and swim to the small whirlpool taking me to the lake near the large whirlpool.</p>
<p>With the Aqua Cape equipped, I go in the large whirlpool and find myself in the Fairy Pond.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3waeXh2siQ">The music for Meia&#39;s Dream is also used here!</a></p>
<p>A lizard comes and greets me with his blade!</p>
<p>I proceed ahead, jumping on small pieces of land and avoiding the fish underneath!</p>
<p>I&#39;m now near a fork, left leads to shallows and two teleporters at the end, with a set of spiked balls on the water. Right goes to the same way, though there&#39;s a secret passage right of that. The way is blocked by large boulders though.</p>
<p>Another passage back at the fork is a set of stairs leading to another teleporter.</p>
<p>I take the stairs and head into the teleporter.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqNjQ_KMsiA">Now the music here is less comforting.</a></p>
<p>I&#39;m now underwater!</p>
<p>I jump down into the chasm below after misjudging the distance of the next step!</p>
<p>I find my way through the high rocky walls, crossing south. I see another teleporter on the other side.</p>
<p>I go back up by using a huge bubble the size of a tiny moving platform.</p>
<p>I take the teleporter back to the surface, and make my way to the southeast fork, where another teleporter awaits.</p>
<p>I warp underwater to a high ledge, where down below are some spiked balls chained to the sea floor.</p>
<p>I land down slowly near a chest containing herbs. After seeing another chest, I reach for that too, which has a Life Vessel inside!!!</p>
<p>My health is now at 35!!! Whoo!</p>
<p>At the bottom, there&#39;s a press switch below. I press it, where some rumbling&#39;s going on. After reading the prompt, which says a low rumble was heard, I head straight to the passage where the boulders were.</p>
<p>I break one spiked ball&#39;s chains with the sword, causing it to float up and make a minor avalanche above. I do the same with two more.</p>
<p>I warp back to the surface and warp to the next teleporter.</p>

<hr>
<p>I&#39;m now at the southern part of the underwater chamber I went to before. Nothing&#39;s here, so I warp back.</p>
<p>The boulders blocking the way are gone!</p>
<p>At the end of the passage is another teleporter. I warp forward!</p>
<p>I&#39;m now underwater again!</p>
<p>I move east and push the boulder at the edge, breaking its twin on another wedge of land!</p>
<p>Because Alundra&#39;s jumps get slower yet higher when underwater, I have to be careful here. I keep saying &quot;I have to be careful here&quot; a lot...</p>
<p>A lot of just underwater jumping at the moment...</p>
<p>After reading the guide again, I jump east from a certain stone of land. I manage to grab herbs from a chest, and keep on jumping...</p>
<p>I manage to make it to a teleporter at the south end! I warp, where I&#39;m now on the other side of the Pond cavern.</p>
<p>Another teleporter is at the top of the tall waterfall, so I head south, and jump down...to a duo of lizards! And moving spiked balls!</p>
<p>I head to the teleporter on the other end of the passage, where I&#39;m now underwater once more!</p>
<p>I cut the chains off all the spiked balls, stand on a rising bubble (air bubbles in this game are like rising platforms), and jump through platforms of land until I reach a chest of herbs.</p>
<p>I grab another chest of herbs on a rocky platform and jump down to the sea floor.</p>
<p>Next I use the rising bubbles to reach a chest on a high northwest ledge, which has...more herbs!</p>
<p>I see two more teleporter panels, where I jump east to the nearest teleporter, which takes me back to the surface, at the top of the waterfall!</p>
<p>I warp back underwater and use the far east teleporter. I&#39;m now in another area at the surface of the Pond cave, where more spiked balls are on the water!</p>
<p>Owch!</p>

<p>A tunnel at the north end lies forward. In there, I see a hall of fairy statues, and at the end, a fairy fountain.</p>
<p>In a flash of blue light, I&#39;m greeted by the fairy called Stenia.</p>
<p>Stenia, Queen of the Waters, explains about the history of the gods, especially the Gazeck, which Nirude was one of them.</p>
<p>The Giants were carved by ancient humans, and there were seven of them, and became what the humans had seen them as: gods.</p>
<p>The Giants were selfish and tried to kill each other just to be loved by humans...except for Nirude.</p>
<p>Stenia mentions Melzas again, and refers to him as another god &quot;using fear to gain the faith of humans.&quot;</p>
<p>Melzas, however, was also afraid of the humans, who could take his power away. So he decided to kill people who threatened his power.</p>
<p>Wait a minute, does that mean that Sybill was murdered <strong>because her visions threatened Melzas&#39;s power? Along with the other villagers too?!</strong></p>
<p>However, the Pond cave is beginning to collapse by Melzas&#39;s interference. Stenia&#39;s final move is to bring Alundra one last gift...a <strong>Fiend Blade!!!</strong></p>
<p>Lucky there&#39;s no time limit in this cave!</p>
<p>The rumbling and shaking&#39;s getting worse!</p>
<p>I&#39;m out of the Pond!</p>
<p>So now I have an upgrade of the Sword now!!</p>
<p>I swim south to the area near the Fire Manor, and head north, saving my progress again.</p>
<p>I check the map again, and notice a chest on the left side of the land near the area where I got the Water Book. After finding a secret slope leading to the area, I get the Gilded Falcon from the chest!</p>
<p>Now I think it&#39;s time to visit the Riverside Pub and make use of the Secret Pass I snatched a while back...</p>

<p>Wait a minute, when I pressed the gate switch in the east attic, I found out that I could get into the west attic while the gate was closed via the clock tower...</p>
<p>Big spiked balls eat my health again! Recovery Ring time!</p>
<p>I head back up to the west clock tower and jump off the right gap and head into the attic.</p>
<p><strong>Voila!</strong> The path east is open! I exit through the east part of the west attic...</p>
<p>I jump down, and head east, going into the Shrine again.</p>
<p>I&#39;m now in the middle balcony of the main hall, and exit to the east part of the balcony.</p>
<p>I regenerate my health again...</p>
<p>There&#39;s a spring pot next to the entrance of the main hall balcony here.</p>
<p>Using that, I make my way to the east roof, and head west...</p>
<p>Ooooh, what a nice view!</p>
<p>I go back and jump into the east attic. Now that I&#39;ve pressed the gate switch there, I have access to the southeast wing hall!</p>
<p>I press the switch there, and flip the gate open. I head back to the hall and unlock the door there.</p>
<p>Ah! Three more mummies in this bedroom, and there are holes going down to the library!</p>
<p>The mummies cause considerable damage, so I equip Nava&#39;s Charm again!</p>
<p>There are two ways into the next room on the east. The north end has gates, while the south perch has press switches!</p>
<p>I press one of them, raising their respective gate! I move on to press another. After a second, the previous switch turns off, lowering its gate.</p>
<p>I decide to hop over them rapidly, which did the trick!</p>
<p>I head to the north perch, climb the stairs, and press the switch!</p>
<p><strong>All right, one more barrier to go!</strong></p>
<p>I recover at the outskirts of the Shrine and save at Jess&#39;s house...I miss Jess.</p>
<p><a name=12></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Now it&#39;s time to get the last barrier out of the way!</p>
<p>Lucky the game developers put that shortcut (from the village well to the Lake Shrine) in!</p>
<p>I head upstairs to the east wing, flipping the gate blocking the south hall horizontally, and crossing out to the balcony.</p>
<p>I head south and into another chamber at the middle floors of the clock tower. After going east, and upstairs, I&#39;m outside again!</p>
<p><strong>Now to press this switch, and bring down the last barrier!</strong></p>
<p>Now that I think about it, it feels like I&#39;m playing Ganon&#39;s Tower in <em>Ocarina of Time</em> again, even though this game was released a whole year before OoT...</p>
<p>I head back down and south and hit the lever, opening the way to the east clock tower stairway.</p>
<p>I leave the Shrine and save again before finally facing Melzas, <strong>and beating this game once and for all!!!</strong></p>

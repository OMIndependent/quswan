<p>I&#39;m trying to get back my sense of direction...</p>
<p>And I&#39;m back at the Shrine!</p>
<p>I wander around the east wing and head to the attic and jump out of the window before heading to its clock tower...</p>
<p>Now how did I move the pillars out of the way before?</p>
<p>I reread my walkthrough from a few days ago, and cross onwards to the top.</p>
<p>The press switches actually slow down the small spiked balls&#39; movements on the stairs.</p>
<p>There&#39;s no gap to jump off from the balcony, so I head all the way to the top of the west clock tower...hoo boy...</p>
<p>I sidetrack to the doorway at the base of the stairs leading to the clock tower to see if there&#39;s another way to the top...nope.</p>
<p>I head back and make my painful way to the big spiked ball dominating stairway.</p>
<p>Gargoyles and spiked balls!</p>
<p>There, I made it!</p>
<p>After exiting, I climb more stairs outside and use the right gap to jump down to the roof of the Shrine, and head into the attic room.</p>
<p>I leave the attic and jump off the roof and go up the clock tower again...</p>
<p>Crap, I&#39;m almost out of health!</p>
<p>I make it to the top and jump down the east gap again, nothing new!</p>
<p>I equip the Recovery Ring to slowly regenerate my health and write the rest of this down.</p>
<p>I head into the attic and downstairs into the hallway to see if I&#39;ve completed everything there...yes, I did.</p>
<p>I double back to the attic and head downstairs...</p>
<p>Against my better judgment, instead of going to the east wing, I head back to the west clock tower...</p>
<p>Ahhhh, these spiked balls and gargoyles!</p>
<p>There we go, the gargoyles are taken care of...</p>
<p>I fall down the gap to the right again!</p>
<p>Something&#39;s missing here...</p>
<p>I press the switch in the west attic, flipping the gate horizontally, blocking my way out to the roof.</p>
<p>The east wing may have some answers...</p>

<p>That unsettling dream music plays again. I miss the Kline dream music...</p>
<p>I&#39;m now in a cavern filled with bushes and a big block northeast of them, covering a hole.</p>
<p>I go on ahead to a passage, leading to a tunnel to another passage and a set of stairs east. I take the stairs down first.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a huge bed of spikes here!</p>
<p>I go back up and head north, where I hear a clanging sound. Oh great, it&#39;s another spiked ball moving around!</p>
<p>Four blue slimes come down from the ceiling!</p>
<p>I take care of them, and four mudmen come down! But they look gravelly and grayish, and they don&#39;t spit out mud!</p>
<p>Each time I hit them, roaches come out of them, but they die shortly! They also form into bulging puddles too! Uggghhhh...</p>
<p>The spectres from Kline&#39;s dream are also here as well!</p>
<p>A chest drops down, but it&#39;s a Mimic!</p>
<p>After taking care of him, a switch drops down! I press it, opening the door back, and the big block at the beginning is gone too!</p>
<p>The way down takes me to a chamber with a path full of left arrows on the floor!</p>
<p>A blue slime drops down, after that, a jar!</p>
<p>After a couple of attempts, I jump on the jar and make it to the ledge and press on the switch there.</p>
<p>The east wall near the entrance is now gone!</p>
<p>I move forward, pushing a block north, using it as a bridge over the chasm.</p>
<p>I take care of a stray spectre and push another block east and jump over that one.</p>
<p>I see a tunnel leading to bushes and a set of stairs downwards.</p>
<p>I go back and I accidentally fall down to the chamber full of spikes and ledges!</p>
<p>There&#39;s a chest on a bed of spikes, which contains herbs. Another chest is also there, but on a high ledge.</p>
<p>After some painful crossings, and ill-timed jumps, I grab the herbs from the second chest.</p>
<p>Still scouting the chamber in any case there were extra chests!</p>
<p>I leap over the pillars, and short ledges, while avoiding spectres, and make it back!</p>
<p>I push the first block east, and push another block until I hit a dead end! </p>
<p>I find a northeast tunnel taking me to a cracked circle panel, and a chest on a high ledge west of me.</p>
<p>I leave and jump over the chasm west, and head into that tunnel again, where I head down in a staircase there.</p>
<p>The stairs take me to the ledge and spikes chamber again.</p>
<p>I go back to the cracked stone panel room, where there are pushable blocks, stalagmites, and a save teleporter!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>After saving, I figure out how to push the blocks by using the flail.</p>
<p>I head west, pushing the block into the hole, using it as a bridge, and find a lever switch on a wall.</p>
<p>Oh my god, the block pushed itself back up to its ledge!</p>
<p>I use the bow to hit the lever, where the floor below me drops, and I land on a barrel in a room full of spikes!</p>
<p>I carry the barrel to the spike bed, jump, and grab the chest of herbs east of me.</p>
<p>With careful aim, I jump to a southwestern ledge, where a teleporter takes me back to the block chamber above!</p>
<p>After a few fruitless tries trying to get the chest on the west ledge, and one failed one trying to the east ledge&#39;s chest, I give up and move forward.</p>
<p>Oh god, I&#39;m locked in! With four spectres!</p>
<p>I head forward, where I&#39;m now locked in a chamber with eight orb pillars! One is flashing, so I try to hit the ones that aren&#39;t flashing. No good, so I hit the flashing pillar, making another pillar flash, and so on!</p>
<p>I run out of time, so I start over again!</p>
<p>After hitting all eight of them, a teleporter forward is visible and the way back is open!</p>
<p>I warp forward where I see carved stone faces flanking a tunnel forward. As I move left, the left head&#39;s eyes start glowing red, and a thud is heard. I head right, where the same thing happens.</p>
<p>In the eastern part of the cave, there are spiked balls moving up and down!</p>
<p>However, the way further in is blocked, so I go to the tunnel forward.</p>
<p>I hear some wooden mechanism sound...it&#39;s boulders tumbling down the steps!</p>
<p>I move forward and make it to a room with an ice block on a ledge in the middle with more orb pillars around the room.</p>
<p>The order to hit them is NW, SE, SW, and NE.</p>
<p>A jar drops down, where I use it to jump to the ledge where the ice block is, and carrying that, move past floating big blocks, and a spiked ball west onto a pedestal, and a square relief on the floor.</p>
<p>I throw the block onto the pedestal, where the square part vanishes, and I drop down another chasm to find myself in a bed of bushes, two chests on high ledges, and more warping gargoyles!</p>
<p>I grab both herbs from the chests, and hit the lever hidden in the bushes, opening the gate in the east.</p>
<p>I teleport back to the room with the rocky faces, and head east this time.</p>
<p>This time, I jump over one of the rock faces, and make it east past the spiked balls where a pedestal to fit an ice rock, and a square-shaped crack on the floor are.</p>
<p>I go back to the room with the ice block.</p>
<p>The pit is still open, and I watch my footing carefully as I land east of a second chasm, where a chest is, containing a Gilded Falcon.</p>
<p>I jump down the chasm, and warp back. I realize that I&#39;m back at the room with the rocky faces, where I head left (avoiding the gaze of the heads this time) and notice an open chest, the chest where the Gilded Falcon was.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I make my way around and land west of the chasm to reach an ice rock at the stone face room. I carry that, avoiding the second chasm, past the faces and spiked balls, and throw it on the pedestal.</p>
<p>Carefully, I throw the rock, and the square hole reveals itself. I fall on the east side of the hole to a room where four slimes, and later, four spectres, greet me.</p>
<p>I throw the ice block onto the pedestal in the room, where another hole opens the way down.</p>
<p>I fall in front of a rubbled tunnel, where a bed of spikes lay south and below, and a fireball flanked by two static gargoyles west guarding a cracked tunnel are.</p>
<p>I bomb the rubble and head into a tunnel where a chest with Wonder Essence is at the end of it.</p>
<p>I jump over the gargoyles and make it into another tunnel, where a maze made up of stalagmites cometh.</p>
<p>A chest awaits, but as I get closer, the platform below it moves up, as if it&#39;s baiting me!</p>
<p>I try again, realizing that it&#39;s a timed race, and I make it! I open the chest, which has a Life Vessel!!!</p>
<p>Going back, I jump on the moving platforms above the spike bed, and cross over!</p>
<p>I make to a tunnel in the east, where a teleporter takes me back to the save teleporter room.</p>
<p>After circling around the chambers in the dream, and falling carefully down into the second hole, and pressing up on the control pad, I&#39;m now in an empty room with two gargoyles flanking a fireball.</p>
<p>I take care of them, go back, and jump down.</p>
<p>The place where they were guarding is already gone, and the crack there is now a tunnel!</p>
<p>I use up my Wonder Essence so I could get the one I found from the chest earlier!</p>
<p>I head into the formerly guarded tunnel, where there are 16 switches, laid out like this:</p>
<p><strong>X...X...X...X<br>
X...X...X...X<br>
X...X...X...X<br>
X...X...X...X</strong></p>
<p>After pressing one of them, the switches around it also turn on, like so:</p>
<p><strong>...X...<br>
X..O..X<br>
...X...</strong></p>
<p>The solution:</p>
<p><strong>X...O...X...X<br>
X...X...X...O<br>
O...X...X...X<br>
X...X...O...X</strong></p>
<p>The O&#39;s are the pressed switches.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I move forward, where I&#39;m greeted by two bug mudmen! It takes eight hits from the flail to take care of one, but two charge strikes from the sword for the same result!</p>
<p>There&#39;s a tunnel west, and a huge set of dropping spiked balls north on a higher ledge! Northeast of that is a pedestal and square relief, and two teleporter panels. The west one works, while the other is cracked.</p>
<p>I go back and head to the west tunnel, where a press switch is on a ledge.</p>
<p>I go back again, where I cross the lunging spiked balls, and warp through the west teleporter. The place I&#39;m now in is in a room with four gray bug mudmen. After taking care of them, I find 30 gilders in a chest!</p>
<p>I warp back and make my way east, where a set of spiked balls drop and move!</p>
<p>After turning a corner at the end of the hall, a ledge with an ice rock on top is there.</p>
<p>With no way to reach it, I head to the western tunnel again after reading the guide.</p>
<p>I press the switch on the ledge, which becomes a chain of switches I have to press.</p>
<p>Ai yaaaa, I keep falling to the bottom!</p>
<p>The perception of height and depth here is very hard to see because of the sameness of these cliffs!</p>
<p>I move east where a spiked platform floats upwards. Sadly, I hit my head on them and fall down a hole, down to the ice block room.</p>
<p>I go back to the western tunnel again, making the jumps. With careful crossing, I touch the teleporter...where I&#39;m back at the east panel near the pedestal and floor!</p>
<p>I read the guide again and jump down the second hole, where I land on the ledge with the ice block. I pick up the block...and four gray roach mudmen appear!</p>
<p>I carry the block to the pedestal, opening the hole. However, I backtrack and save.</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>After reading the guide carefully, I realize that the blocks near the save teleporter can be pushed south so they can make the chests at the ledges reachable. I jump on one of the rocks, then the block, and make it to one of the chests, where herbs are inside. The east chest had herbs too.</p>
<p>Why didn&#39;t I notice this part sooner!?</p>
<p>Anyway, I make it back to the pedestal and hole flanked by the stone teleporter panels and drop down...</p>
<p>The fireball shooting bird statues from the Ancient Shrine make their return again, along with the bug mudmen!</p>
<p>The statues now rotate and shoot so quickly that I get hit by two of them!</p>
<p>The crack at the base of the ledge where I landed breaks open after I finish off the bug mudmen.</p>
<p>Inside are a few of those odd carrayable plants I saw back at the Coastal Cave.</p>
<p>It turns out that after throwing the plant a few times, according to the guide, I get an herb! I have to remember now that those plants may have an herb if thrown!</p>
<p>I go back and forth into that room to throw the plants to get more herbs. After getting it and exiting out, I&#39;m greeted by three spectres!</p>
<p>The fancy door ahead opens after their defeat!</p>
<p>There&#39;s a lot of lifelike gargoyle statues here, or Soul Eaters, as the guide calls them!</p>
<p>There&#39;s now a whole lotta shaking going on...</p>
<p>The gargoyles save for two warp away, and the fight begins!</p>
<p>I proceed onwards!</p>
<p>Oh my god, Giles is in pain!</p>
<p>The boss here is the same as the one in Kline&#39;s dream!</p>
<p>Septimus gives us warnings, where he says Giles is now teetering between life and death, and he tells us to take care of the monster without harming Giles! After a word of good luck, the fight is on! Thank you, Septimus, for that not very helpful advice.</p>
<p>After Giles gets sucked in by the boss, the Wonder Essence gives us another chance!</p>
<p>I hit him with the new fire magic, causing the sucking monster to reel back!</p>
<p>After many bombs and three fire spells doing the job, I watch the fireworks!</p>
<p>The <strong>Soul Leech</strong> has been destroyed!</p>

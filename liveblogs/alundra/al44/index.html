<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>Cephas says that Ronan is &quot;a bitter, humorless lump of anti-humanity.&quot; He loves it.</p>
<p>I meet up with Septimus, who&#39;s trying to get in the Sanctuary. </p>
<p>Septimus says he can&#39;t go through the front door, as it&#39;s locked...he tells us that one of the windows in the upper floors can be broken. Though he thinks breaking and entering is really a desperate move and that &quot;eternal damnation&quot; is to be expected. Let&#39;s do it!</p>
<p>He tells us to climb the moat wall in the back and from there, we&#39;ll break the window...</p>
<p>But where is the moat wall?</p>
<p>There might be a tunnel underneath the Sanctuary though.</p>
<p>After searching the whole area, and the area around Magyscar for a while, I jump over Lyman&#39;s headstone and make it on to the moat wall.</p>
<p>Septimus bids me good luck as I smash the window to pieces!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3InmMzDfrQ">I&#39;m now in, at the kitchen.</a></p>
<p>The infirmary&#39;s got nothing suspicious...</p>
<p>I head for the main hall. Septimus bangs the front door, asking me to let him in.</p>
<p>He goes to examine the altar, and tells us to examine Ronan&#39;s quarters upstairs in the east hall.</p>
<p>The Sanctuary looks a bit different the last time I visited it...</p>
<p>I check the library. Nothing.</p>
<p>Septimus finds a tome above on a pillar, where below that is a switch. I tell him to press it.</p>
<p>A shake and a rumble, which opens a door west.</p>
<p>The south room in the west wing is open, where two levers are.</p>
<p>After switching on the two levers, another shake, and a press switch drops down on a high block!</p>
<p>I head up to the infirmary, but Septimus calls me and says that he found another switch.</p>
<p>He presses it, and a spiked ball drops from above!</p>
<p>This Sanctuary really is getting more suspicious and a bit frightening...</p>
<p>A big gaping hole is at the infirmary, which I jump down, and press the switch below.</p>
<p>It opens the door north.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Coffins!? And a book appears!</p>
<p>I try to get it, but the book disappears and reappears on one of the other coffins!</p>
<p>The layout looks like this:</p>
<p><strong>1..2..3..4<br>
5..6..7..8</strong></p>
<p>The book appears at <strong>4, 6, 8, 1, 7, 5,</strong> then back to <strong>4</strong>.</p>
<p>How do we get that book?</p>
<p>I go back to the altar and see Septimus, who finds that the shrine table moved a bit, and we ask him about the vanishing book. He goes on ahead.</p>
<p>Septimus tells us that we have to chase after the book and he&#39;ll take it when it appears in front of the coffin he&#39;s at, which is coffin 5.</p>
<p>Septimus has the book!</p>
<p>I get the Book of Runes!!</p>
<p>I use the book and place it on the bookshelf with the gap in the library.</p>
<p>I love this dungeon! So much mystery and tension behind its walls...</p>
<p>The bookshelf below moves out of the way.</p>
<p>I see another bookshelf with a gap between books.</p>
<p>Septimus finds another switch on the east side of the altar!</p>
<p>He&#39;s tempted to push the switch that could be a death trap.</p>
<p>I tell him to go for it. Another rumble comes from the east wing!</p>
<p>The confession room&#39;s door above is now open.</p>
<p>I go in, and grab the chest at the end of hall, containing a Life Vessel!!!</p>
<p>I head upstairs, seeing nothing.</p>
<p>I then go back to that room where the chest was, and push two of the three wooden stools there.</p>
<p>After pushing them into a straight line, a lever drops!</p>
<p>A rumble, and the door south is open, which is a classroom!</p>
<p>The classroom rumbles and the stools there move out of place.</p>
<p>Another shake!?</p>
<p>I move the stools back to their places.</p>
<p>I get a Book of Verse!!</p>
<p>The mysteries of this Sanctuary are getting deeper!</p>
<p>I place the Book of Verse in the empty gap in the southern bookshelf back at the library.</p>
<p>Another bookshelf east of us moves, and a press switch is there!</p>
<p>I press it, and Ronan&#39;s quarters open!</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Oh great, the lever vanished!</p>
<p>I try again and I make it to the lever in Ronan&#39;s room, which makes a chest drop from the ceiling!</p>
<p>Oh I see! By touching the carpet, the lever and the chest vanish!</p>
<p>I jump on the furniture in his quarters to get the chest, which has a...golden, oddly-shaped key.</p>
<p>I head back to Septimus, who&#39;s noticed the keyhole on the shrine table.</p>
<p>We give the key to Septimus. He turns it...</p>
<p>Oooooh, a secret staircase!</p>
<p>Septimus bets that Ronan knows what he&#39;s doing with what&#39;s here.</p>
<p>Ooooh, the tension is so...tense here. I breathe deeply as I head down.</p>
<p>The stairway and the hallway is so deep and long...</p>
<p>At the end of the passage...oh my god, it&#39;s a huge statue of Melzas, and Ronan is praying at the base of it!</p>
<p>The King, Septimus says, made it illegal for idols to be worshipped.</p>
<p>Ronan says that the gods are angry for being neglected, and claims he is a faithful servant of them. He has broken the law since it was formed, and the villagers are well aware of his &quot;crime.&quot;</p>
<p>Ronan implicitly accuses Meia for saying that the nightmares were the work of evil, and probably accuses us too. What a deceptor. I don&#39;t trust him...</p>
<p>After the law was placed, the village learned to control their dreams, and he blames mankind, himself too, for their problems.</p>
<p><strong>Septimus:</strong> &quot;A merciless god is a demon!&quot; He leaves.</p>
<p>Ronan laughs since the gods, according to him, are now laughing at Septimus&#39;s &quot;ill-timed blasphemy!&quot;</p>
<p>We leave, getting nowhere with this argument.</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>There could be no doubt. It was a portrait of Melzas in the basement of the sanctuary. Is Ronan the one who worshipped his image? Or had other villagers knelt to his soul as well?</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Wait a minute. Since Ronan told Alundra near the beginning of the game to pray, had <strong>we</strong> also unknowingly prayed to Melzas&#39;s image too?</p>
<p><strong>Is this what Jeal was trying to warn us about, where he said that by threatening Melzas, we are also threatening reality?</strong></p>
<p>If all of this is true, oh my god...oh my god...this is deep...this is getting too deep...</p>

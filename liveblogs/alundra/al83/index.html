<p>Taking a deep breath, I leave the portal chamber, and head through the front gate of the Shrine.</p>
<p>The garden area outside the entrance looks completely pristine!</p>
<p>Which brings up one question: How is the garden still beautiful when it&#39;s been submerged in a lake for almost four centuries?</p>
<p>Anyway, I head forward to another locked gate, and proceed right, and traverse the hedge maze.</p>
<p>I press the switch there, which lowers the east red barrier on the brazier near the entrance proper. I head east and through the hedges to open a chest, which has a key!</p>
<p>I cross through some loose hedges west of the chest and open the gate!</p>
<p>I&#39;m now in a gazebo in the center of the garden, where the east and west gates are firmly locked!</p>
<p>I cross north.</p>
<p>The statues here look a bit ominous...there are lion&#39;s head statues in the maze, and knights on dragons flanking the stairway to the entrance of the Shrine proper...which is barred shut.</p>
<p>Two chests are beside the entrance proper...the right one gives me a <strong>Magic Seed!</strong> Now I have four charges on my magic meter!</p>
<p>The left one has a Gilded Falcon!</p>
<p>I cross down the stairway and head east to another stairway, leading to a press switch.</p>
<p>Crossing through more hedge holes in the maze, I see a teleporter east and a chest containing a key!</p>
<p>I open the east gate with the key and head back to the foot of the entrance steps.</p>
<p>I climb the west stairway near the entrance and jump to a ledge to press on a switch there, opening the west portcullis.</p>
<p>I double back to the west part of the maze after seeing a teleporter there, which warps me to the east part of the maze. Heading past a gap in the hedges, I move east, where I&#39;m at the unreachable chest at the eastern part of the Shrine wall!</p>
<p>The chest has another key!</p>
<p>I use the key to open the west gate, and head north into the hedge hole, where I find and open another chest containing another key! I jump past the chest to get out of that part of the maze.</p>
<p>I survey the maze a bit more before opening a gate in the west wing of the maze, which, after making a left, leads to a teleporter...</p>
<p>I&#39;m now on the south end of the maze, where I see a press switch.</p>
<p>This lowers the west buzzing barrier near the entrance, and thus, lifts the center portcullis!</p>
<p>Passing through a hedge hole to get out, I head to the east entrance of the Shrine.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a lot of huge weeds in the water in this room, and the water is deeper than it looks.</p>
<p>A teleporter pad is at the center top of the room, which I use!</p>
<p>It takes me...to the bottom of a well. I climb up, I&#39;m back at Inoa Village!</p>
<p>I save at Jess&#39;s, and stop here.</p>

<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>I read the sign from the locked house outside the village, which says, &quot;Contact Centurius XXI.&quot; It took me a while to get that joke.</p>
<p>On the way, I find a lot of blocked paths, vines, a mysterious statue, and empty houses near the mine.</p>
<p>I see Jess along with two other people before the entrance and he tells me not to be a hero if things get tough. I use the bomb to bust open the rubble on the upper part of the mine, and double back to explore around the outside some more.</p>
<p>After exploring, I bomb the rubble covering the entrance to the mine but I don&#39;t head in yet.</p>
<p>Instead, I head into a cave near the upper part of the mine. In there, are five blue slimes. However, the platform ahead rises to a higher ledge when one of the slimes is defeated.</p>
<p>I succeed in going further in the cave, but more blue slimes drop from the ceiling, and move forward. But unless I can swim, I&#39;m stuck, so I turn back. I do get 10 gilders (coins) for that detour though.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Now I go to the coal mine, more shaking and falling rubble. I head to the engine room, which is locked.</p>
<p>I go back and head deeper in the mine.</p>
<p>More fire-breathing rock turtles are in the way, but I light a bomb in front of them. Once they blew fire, boom!</p>
<p>I take care of some rubble in that part of the room to reveal a staircase and go down.</p>
<p>The Murgg are now surrounding and trying to kill a miner named Lyman (no West Wing jokes please!). I take care of them, but it&#39;s too late...</p>
<p>Lyman hands me a key to the service room where the other miners are and goes to sleep for a very long time...</p>
<p>I use the key to open the engine room and turn on the engine, using the combination I received from Olen&#39;s dream. Left, left, right, left.</p>
<p>I jump in the minecart. Whee!</p>
<p>More rubble and an engine explodes, great!</p>
<p>The water I&#39;m walking on slows me down a lot.</p>
<p>I&#39;m now at the next room, a shaking maze with falling rocks. I get hit by the rocks twice and make it to dry land, and on to the scaffolding. The rocks keep falling though.</p>
<p>I switch on the engine. Power is now restored on Access Shaft 1, I&#39;m told.</p>
<p>I found out as I got back that there were two ways to get to the scaffolding, and I took the long way...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p><em>(To the tune of Toyland)</em> Minecarts, minecarts, make everything quicker...</p>
<p>The gate door further on is locked. But I see a pulsing, glowing symbol in the middle of the shaft on the other side of the shaft gate. Hmmm...</p>
<p>I check any other rooms to see if I&#39;m missing something.</p>
<p>Pretty detailed animation for Alundra&#39;s sprite here...</p>
<p>I realized there was a switch near the rails at the first shaft I went! I pull that switch, and make my way to the cart.</p>
<p>While riding the cart, I ran over five slimes. Ouch!</p>
<p>Oh no, more Murgg! For some reason, they&#39;re fixated with killing the miners. Why though? I think they might be controlled, or are under orders, by someone.</p>
<p>Jaylen, the next miner, is gone too, but I get a key probably to the door to the purple sigil room, or the working area.</p>
<p>I use the key to open the door and wander about trying to get the two chests I saw.</p>
<p>The miners were planning to expand the place, huh?</p>
<p>I get an herb from one of the chests, and try to get the second chest from the top of the scaffolding. I managed to clear out any rocks from the minecart path though.</p>
<p>I step on the symbol, and it leads me to a recovery and save point yes!</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I now go back and try to find a way further in the mine.</p>
<p>I find a way into the westward tunnel. Oddly enough, without a bomb, it takes eight hits from Alundra&#39;s sword to take care of a rock turtle.</p>
<p>I get rid of the rubble blocking the way and jump down into the hole, where the last miner Zane is. Zane is already gone too...</p>
<p>On the left of him I find a chest with a key inside.</p>
<p>I get stuck and jump over the opened chest to get out.</p>
<p>I use the key to open the mine door containing a switch, and pull the switch to the left.</p>
<p>I save and recover before moving on to the western shaft.</p>
<p>This coal mine dungeon is very long!</p>
<p>More falling rocks blocking the way, how helpful!</p>
<p>There&#39;s a chest there on the other side of the ledge but the gap is too wide!</p>
<p>I give up and go farther into the western shaft, getting an herb and riding the cart to another part of the shaft. Whew!</p>
<p>I now head up to find an engine, where the sign says to pull lower lever thrice and the upper lever once, and to &quot;shake things up&quot; if it doesn&#39;t work. I pull the switches, and...nothing happens.</p>
<p>I try bombing the engine around five times, I think, no good. I go on top of the engine, and to &quot;shake things up&quot; I jumped on it thrice. It worked!</p>
<p>I go on the elevator, further down in the mine. What&#39;s beyond the point of no return?</p>
<p>I find sparkling stuff on the water and it restores my health, looks like there&#39;s a boss coming up!</p>
<p>Oh my god! Zazan, a super huge Murgg baboon, is tasked with finding seven &quot;Crests&quot; for Melzas, and is furious that his minions only found two in the mine! He&#39;s also causing the quakes, too!</p>
<p>Thanks to his spinning around, I&#39;m now trapped!</p>
<p>After getting the four Murgg out of the way, I get another Life Vessel, and head my way out of the mine. The rocks have now caved in the way back.</p>

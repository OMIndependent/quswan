Oh Septimus...we B&amp;E&#39;d into a chapel, and we&#39;re now intruding into someone&#39;s mind without their consent... *<em>smh</em>*</p>
<p>Before I go in, I head out to get some treasures. According to the guide, I can use the Power Glove to throw certain kinds of rocks out of the way...</p>
<p>I use the glove on one of those rocks and it works! For my trouble, I grab a Gilded Falcon from a chest!</p>
<p>I head near the area of the Riverside Pub, and move a giant rock aside, where I head forward through the trees, and see a statue, hiding the legendary sword of King Snow.</p>
<p>I talk to it, and King Snow speaks: &quot;<strong>I was once known as King Snow. Legendary swordsman. Legendary swordsmith. Legendary everything...why have you summoned me? Ha! You desire my Legendary Sword.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Yes! We desire your sword, O King Snow!</p>
<p>We get a glimpse of the legendary sword, which looks like a Falchion.</p>
<p>However, he doubts Alundra&#39;s ability to wield it, and thinks of Alundra&#39;s sword skills so fine that we don&#39;t need it at all...</p>
<p>Conversation over.</p>
<p>Oh well. I head around back to the marshes to reach secret paths and collect two unopened chests, one of which is a Magic Elixyr, which I have, and the other a Life Vessel!!!</p>
<p>Now my health is maxed out to 26!!!</p>
<p>I head back to the village. On the way to Jess&#39;s, I see Septimus lurking at the corner of Myra&#39;s house, while Myra guards the front.</p>
<p>I save and head down to greet Septimus.</p>
<p>Septimus starts distracting Myra by mentioning Meia...</p>
<p>I go in to the house. Holy jeez...I feel very nervous doing this...</p>
<p><strong>*dream whoosh*</strong></p>

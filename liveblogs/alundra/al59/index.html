<p>I head to the cemetery, though, and I get this gem from Meia:</p>
<p><strong>Meia:</strong> &quot;Hello? Alundra? I meant let&#39;s go inside the SANCTUARY, not the CEMETERY!&quot;</p>
<p>I sigh deeply, the breath before the plunge...and head in!</p>
<p>Meia feels Melzas&#39;s presence, and Ronan says the gods have shown themselves to Meia.</p>
<p>Ronan confesses that he knows Meia&#39;s going to destroy the statue. He also reveals that the Mayor is well aware about the statue of Melzas, as well as the villagers. </p>
<p>What a manipulator this man is, he says that by destroying the statue, the villagers would turn against Alundra and Meia.</p>
<p>Meia doesn&#39;t care, however. She&#39;s going to prove to everyone that the statue is the source of all the evil going on around the village. After remembering her backstory, I&#39;m now scared for her...</p>
<p>Ronan laughs a familiar-sounding laugh, after calling Meia a blasphemer. I&#39;m betting he&#39;s Zorgia.</p>
<p>We leave the Sanctuary.</p>
<p>Meia knows Ronan killed Sybill, and she says that he&#39;s going to target &quot;someone else near [to] us.&quot; <strong>*shudders*</strong></p>
<p>She will watch Septimus while she tasks us to watch Jess, and that she&#39;ll meet up with us tomorrow...</p>
<p>I look at Sybill&#39;s grave one more time, and leave to head to Jess&#39;s house...</p>
<p><strong>Jess:</strong> &quot;<strong>Alundra, you should get some rest. You look tired, you know what I&#39;m saying? Always running around from one place to another. You deserve to relax tonight, my friend! What? Me? I...cannot sleep yet. I have much work to do.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>He calls to me as I try to leave again, so I head upstairs and head to sleep...</p>

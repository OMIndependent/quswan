<p>Oh boy, oh boy, I&#39;m heading to a desert soon!</p>
<p>I go downstairs to see what Jess is doing. Looks like his clanging means I get something new!</p>
<p><strong>Jess:</strong> &quot;Nadia&#39;s death...inspired me to make this.&quot; Why does everyone that die in the village inspire Jess to make a new weapon?</p>
<p>The weapon is an <strong>Iron Flail</strong>, yes! I&#39;m betting Nintendo may have gotten the idea for the Ball-and-Chain for <em>Twilight Princess</em> from here.</p>
<p><strong>Jess:</strong> &quot;<strong>Everytime someone dies...an idea for a new weapon pops into my head. I&#39;ve never been so racked with guilt in my life! I tell you that&#39;s no small feat! You know what I&#39;m saying? All I can think is that these weapons are a gift of inspiration from those who have died in this terrible plague!</strong>&quot; Poor Jess, and everyone else... :(</p>
<p>Sierra says Sybill wants to see me.</p>
<p>One of the villagers say that the Murgg have destroyed the tree blocking the way to the desert, planning a trap. The mayor thinks Nadia exploded the barricade.</p>
<p><strong>Past!Me:</strong> &quot;When are the villagers gonna clean up that fallen tree that&#39;s blocking the way to the desert?&quot; I&#39;m now nunning since Nadia unintentionally did the deed.</p>
<p>I equip and swing the flail. It&#39;s not a Belmont flail though.</p>
<p>I go out and talk to Kisha. The people, she says, can control their dreams, but they are nightmares now.</p>
<p>Giles is still a devotee, thinking his prayers saved Bonaire, but questions his sister&#39;s faith...</p>
<p>Grandpa Wendell talks about a sanctuary in the desert his grandpa mentioned that he wanted to see when he was a kid.</p>
<p>Bonaire now has survivor&#39;s guilt... :(</p>
<p>Myra, Nadia&#39;s mother, is angry that I didn&#39;t save Nadia... :( :(</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Kline mentions that Jess is treating Alundra as if he were his own son, no small accomplishment, he says.</p>
<p>Gustav and Elene&#39;s house is locked.</p>
<p>I go to Sybill&#39;s place for more visions...</p>
<p><strong>Sybill:</strong> &quot;You are surrounded by a sea of sand. The great navigator here is the wind. Let yourself be guided by the powerful gusts...If you trust them with insight, you shall arrive at...a sanctuary.&quot;</p>
<p>Naomi&#39;s now complaining about a shop owned by a guy called Lurvy now getting more business because the tree that blocked the bridge to the desert is now gone. I buy five more herbs from her.</p>
<p>Time to head out!</p>
<p>The flail is slightly more powerful than my small sword! Yes!</p>
<p>I wander around a bit (again!) and I end up in a marsh, getting attacked by mudmen spitting out mud!</p>
<p>I visit the cemetery and read Nadia&#39;s stone:</p>
<p><strong>NADIA.<br>
Rest well in eternal sleep.</strong></p>

<p>Now, it&#39;s time to head to the Glade!</p>
<p>I climb up the vines to the Cirelian Trial there!</p>
<p>I start the trial!</p>
<p>There&#39;s lots of vines to climb in this trial!</p>
<p>There&#39;s also more flame throwers in here!</p>
<p>I manage to get a three-star rank in this trial. The prize at the end is another Spectral Vest...</p>
<p>I decide to try again just to see if I could make it without making the same mistakes again...</p>
<p>I get a higher score, but it wasn&#39;t enough to make it to the four-star rank!</p>
<p>Now I stop at the Sorrowing Meadow to collect the rest of the treasures there!</p>
<p>After doing a lot of monster hunting, and searching along the way, I finally find an air current in one of the tunnels, and start Boost Jumping!</p>
<p>I pick up the nearby treasure keys in this alcove and go to the last Cirelian Trial there!</p>
<p>There&#39;s lots of monsters on the way there though...</p>
<p>This trial has lots of air currents and I have to hit statues at the right time to get them, and to avoid any spikes in the way!</p>
<p>Ah, the zombie monsters are also in this trial too!</p>
<p>I get a Master Ring of Vigilance as a prize!</p>
<p>It seems that there&#39;s another treasure in this area...I look at the Dust wiki. It says that there&#39;s another treasure near the tombstone with a rose. I have to kneel in front of it in order to get to that area where the treasure is...</p>
<p>I&#39;m there, and I have Dust crouch...the camera subtly zooms in closer, and rumbling happens, and Dust is transported!</p>
<p><img src=http://i.imgur.com/dKZWQIw.jpg alt="room w rose" width=608 height=342></p>
<p>It looks like the room where the Samurai Dishwasher was held, except there&#39;s a rose leaning on the big crate...</p>
<p>I head east...</p>
<p>Ah ha, a Friend&#39;s here!</p>
<p>I open the cage...let&#39;s see who it is!</p>
<p><img src=http://i.imgur.com/9Eo0mOK.jpg alt=yuki width=608 height=342></p>
<p>It&#39;s a woman with a chainsaw...it&#39;s Yuki from <em>The Dishwasher: Dead Samurai</em>!</p>
<p>I jump into the teleporter and I&#39;m back at the Meadow!</p>
<p>I kneel to head back to that area again just in case I forgot something.</p>
<p>After that, I head to a nearby monument after taking care of a few monsters on the way. I save, and head off to the Blackmoor Mountains...</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I read through the Dust wiki again, and it says that there&#39;s one more treasure in the Blackmoor Mountains that I missed. I read the note it&#39;s referring to, I&#39;m supposed to be climbing to the &quot;highest peaks of the Blackmoor Mountains [while] carrying a red crystal&quot;, and then I have to kneel once I get there.</p>
<p><img src=http://i.imgur.com/uzZRvSw.jpg alt=note width=608 height=342></p>
<p>I use the save monument from the Meadow to teleport and enter Blackmoor Mountains from Zeplich Village.</p>
<p>I look at the snowprints Dust is making while on my way there. This game is so good at picking up even the tiniest of details...</p>
<p>I head down.</p>
<p>I check the wiki again. It seems I have to crouch at one of the shopkeeper&#39;s areas near a stone with an hourglass carved on it...</p>
<p>After fighting off a horde of monsters and tons of dangerous areas, I make it to the hourglass stone!</p>
<p><img src=http://i.imgur.com/PTjSTtr.jpg alt="hrglss stone" width=608 height=342></p>
<p>Now that I have a Red Orb, all I have to do is kneel...</p>
<p>A tornado warps Dust and Fidget to another area! This kind of sounds like <em>Castlevania II: Simon&#39;s Quest</em> all over again...</p>
<p><img src=http://i.imgur.com/Vk1AbVT.jpg alt=tornado width=608 height=342></p>
<p>Fidget is aware of the random tornado warp too...</p>
<p><img src=http://i.imgur.com/B5aRIvE.jpg alt="made no sense" width=608 height=342></p>
<p><img src=http://i.imgur.com/6xjJFnc.jpg alt=secret width=608 height=342></p>
<p>Now we&#39;re inside a sepia-toned area of the mountainside...</p>
<p>Every time I move, the snowfall moves as well!</p>
<p>The music box music sounds a bit unsettling...</p>
<p>I jump more platforms and cross past crumbling land.</p>
<p>Our final Friend is in this cage...</p>
<p><img src=http://i.imgur.com/3y8gLfr.jpg alt="who is it?" width=608 height=342></p>
<p><img src=http://i.imgur.com/udwWcmr.jpg alt=tim width=608 height=342></p>
<p>After checking the Dust wiki, it turns out I just rescued Tim from <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braid_(video_game)><em>Braid</em></a>!</p>
<p>I check my map again, it seems like there&#39;s also another treasure I missed...</p>
<p>I go back to the place where we found Tim, it turns out I just missed a key here!</p>
<p>Now I head back, find a monument, and teleport out of the mountains!</p>
<p><a name=6></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I&#39;m still missing some treasure in Archers&#39; Pass...</p>
<p>I read the Dust wiki, and the Lead of Faith note. It seems that I&#39;ll need to jump from a headless statue&#39;s hand...</p>
<p>I&#39;m now on the hand where the headless statue is. If I position my jump right...</p>
<p>Whoa, a moving platform appears!</p>
<p><img src=http://i.imgur.com/TySjabx.jpg alt="secret platform" width=608 height=342></p>
<p>And I get teleported to a secret passage!</p>
<p><img src=http://i.imgur.com/t2SPuZD.jpg alt="secret alcove" width=608 height=342></p>
<p>There&#39;s two chests in front of me, with a moving platform east, and a teleporter back to the Pass west.</p>
<p>I open the chests here. One of them has a Pendant of the Creature!</p>
<p>The other chest inside has a Wet Suit!</p>
<p>I now use the moving platform to go to another chest!</p>
<p><img src=http://i.imgur.com/EsdhO42.jpg alt="third chest" width=608 height=342></p>
<p>Inside the chest is a Revival Stone...with four Avees!</p>
<p>I&#39;ve completely cleared this area now!</p>
<p>Befoer I head out, I trade with Sereth the shopkeeper!</p>
<p>The loot I bought are Plague Oil, and a Foul Ring of Devastation! I equip them.</p>
<p>However, my game crashes again while I&#39;m on the menu!</p>
<p>Ffdsf;asj;oifajlsnfjlasdfjasljdkflashueilfqwe!!!</p>
<p>It looks like I&#39;ll have to start all over again...</p>
<p><a name=7></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Lucky I saved at the point after I rescued the Friend with the chainsaw!</p>
<p>Because of the game crashing, I&#39;m now saving everytime I see a monument.</p>
<p>After clearing the Archers&#39; Pass, I head back into Aurora, and take on the Cirelian Trail there!</p>
<p>I fetch the Treasure Key there and finish off the Trial...</p>
<p>...I then head to the save monument and save there, and Haley craft some augments from leftover blueprints I&#39;ve been carrying, namely, another Plague Oil, and a Frozen Blade, which I equip.</p>
<p>Though what I really want crafted is the Mithrarin&#39;s Augment. Sadly, I don&#39;t have one of the materials needed to make the augment catalogued, so I can&#39;t buy it from Haley and have her craft it.</p>
<p>I stop my session here before heading into Mt. Doom, or, the Everdawn Basin for the final battle!</p>

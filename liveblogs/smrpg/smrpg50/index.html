<p>We leave Seaside Town and head out into the sea!</p>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/rMKNkR60YcQ>The music here&#39;s the same dungeon music from Kero Sewers.</a></p>
<p>I drop down from a stack of crates and have Mario talk to a mysterious hooded figure...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/QVyOIpz.png alt="hooded figure" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>He sells a variety of stuff new and old, such as weapons like a <strong>Super Hammer</strong> for Mario, and the <strong>Hurly Gloves</strong> for Bowser. Other wares included Sailor equipment for everyone, and a <strong>Nautical Dress</strong> for Peach.</p>
<p>I get some Able Juices and sell the Wake Up Pin.</p>
<p>The hooded guy tells me more stuff as to why there&#39;s a Sunken Ship. A giant squid sunk it! He adds that some people went into investigate but never came back... <img class=emojione alt=â˜¹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>In the room behind him, there&#39;s a save block, and treasure blocks behind a stack of crates.</p>
<p>I save here before heading out.</p>
<p>I head back into the shop and take the south passage, where more crates and a bunch of starfish are lying down...</p>
<p>I hit the chest block, which has a Star in it! Using the star, I knock off most of the starfish blocking the way back!</p>
<p>After wearing out the Star&#39;s power, and knocking most of the starfish away, Peach gains a level! I upgrade her magic power!</p>
<p>I slowly proceed onward, not wanting to touch, or wake up the starfish...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Now in the next cavern, there&#39;s a whirlpool to take us underwater, a chest block high on a ledge above, and the passage south...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/vuqqEd5.png alt=cavern width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Taking the south passage, we&#39;re now outside, at the edge of the ocean...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/mDLAk2S.png alt=sea width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I have Mario head back into the cave, and swim in to the whirlpool, which allows him to walk underwater!</p>
<p>Once inside the tunnel, a burst of pressure pushes Mario up to the surface...</p>
<p>...and we&#39;re now at the ledge where the chest block is!</p>
<p>The chest block contains a <strong>Max Mushroom</strong>, which recovers all health! Now this is an item I need to use sparingly!</p>
<p>I have Mario jump into the whirlpool outside, avoiding contact with the Blooper.</p>
<p>We sink into a pipe-sized opening, above the remains of a ship&#39;s mast...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/PiRNHo2.png alt="inside sunken ship" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>...and we&#39;re now inside the <strong>Sunken Ship</strong>! <a href=https://youtu.be/Nk-VKQVJ_U0>Here&#39;s the music for the level.</a></p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>There&#39;s floating masked spectres, or <strong>Greapers</strong>, above our heads, vanishing and appearing at will, in the next room!</p>
<p>The Greapers are quick, using Deathsickle (which lowers the accuracy of the target), and a Lightning Orb as their opening moves!</p>
<p>Their partner, the <strong>Reacher</strong>, is a powerhouse himself!</p>
<p>Geno gains a level, and I boost his health!</p>
<p>There&#39;s more Dry Bones and haunting Greapers in the next room, along with a note posted on the wall!</p>
<p>The note is a travel log, which tells us to find 6 hints, which are written by different people.</p>
<p>Another monster called the <strong>Straw Head</strong> also joins the fray!</p>
<p>At the next hall, there&#39;s more red rats, or <strong>Alley Rats</strong>, patrolling the staircase...</p>
<p>I use half of my Honey Syrup supply before starting the descent.</p>
<p><strong>Gorgons</strong> are also part of the Alley Rats&#39; party as well! And they&#39;re powerful too!</p>
<p>At another battle, Mario levels up! So does Mallow!</p>
<p>I increase Mario&#39;s health, and Mallow&#39;s magical stats!</p>
<p>Aaaaahhh, these battles are endless!</p>
<p>I manage to escape that one and make it to the bottom deck at the staircase, and collect  the chest block, which has 10 coins!</p>
<p>After reading a map online, I turn back and head to the save block on the ship, which is at the door to the right in the room where we entered!</p>
<p>Before I do that, I switch Peach for Mallow, and have him heal Mario.</p>
<p>On the way back, I pick up a Flower at a corner behind a stack of J crates!</p>
<p>Also, I notice a note, which reads:</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>The door to the cellar is locked with a password consisting of 6 letters. In order to proceed, you&#39;ll have to decipher the password using the 6 hints.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>After saving at the room, I find another note:</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>We&#39;ve managed to trap the giant squid in the treasure cellar. The treasure will sink with the ship but...so it goes!</strong>&quot;</p>

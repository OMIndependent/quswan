<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>I have Mario go back to Monstro Town...</p>
<p>Remembering what I read in the wiki or the guide somewhere, Monstro Town also has a save block at the eastern end of town.</p>
<p>I manage to find it!</p>
<p>It&#39;s inside the hole south of Mario here...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/fCVzOzZ.png alt="save block hole" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I then have Mario head into the 3 Musty Fears inn, and turn off the mushroom lamp in the corner, where he jumps on the bed instantly!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/5x4IB4x.png alt="mario sleep musty fears" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>As Mario sleeps, Greaper appears!</p>
<p>The Big Boo too!</p>
<p>Along with Dry Bones!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/GZ62rn0.png alt="the 3 musty fears" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Greaper:</strong> &quot;He&#39;s sleeping.&quot;<br>
<strong>Dry Bones:</strong> &quot;He sure is.&quot;<br>
<strong>Big Boo:</strong> &quot;Check out the bubbles coming out of his nose!&quot;</p>
<p>They now move in closer, surrounding the sleeping Mario...</p>
<p>They ask him if they could play a game called &quot;Find the Flag.&quot;</p>
<p>Interesting...</p>
<p>They&#39;re going to hide a flag around the world...and if Mario finds all three, he wins a prize!</p>
<p>They now hide the flags!</p>
<p>The mushroom lamp moves and goes before the foot of the bed!</p>
<p>Greaper returns! He hid his flag &quot;behind a wooden flower...&quot;</p>
<p>Dry Bones hid his under a green bed...</p>
<p>And finally, Big Boo returns, where his flag is in a location between &quot;O&quot; and &quot;A&quot;.</p>
<p>Big Boo mentions the flags are well-hidden, and tells us to look <strong>very</strong> carefully!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Mario awakens and we do our flag hunt!</p>
<p>So the flags are hidden at the following locations:</p>
<p>--<strong>Behind a wooden flower</strong><br>
--<strong>Under a green bed</strong><br>
--<strong>Between an &quot;O&quot; and &quot;A&quot;</strong></p>
<p>I check Rose Town first since it&#39;s the only one with a wooden flower...</p>
<p>...and I find the <strong>Greaper&#39;s Flag</strong> behind the sign!</p>
<p>I also visit the home in the high cliff and talk to the father there.</p>
<p>The father knows we&#39;re the ones that took the treasure since Mario&#39;s the only one high enough to reach them. We apologize.</p>
<p>He says &quot;Oh well,&quot; and tells us about more secret treasures in the Forest Maze.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/CztgRum.png alt="treasure in forest maze" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>To find them, it&#39;s <strong>left, left, straight, and right</strong>.</p>
<p>I head upstairs, and bounce on the bed to take the last hidden chest block, which has a Frog Coin, and leave the town at the back.</p>
<p>I&#39;m now at a lone house. I have Mario walk in.</p>
<p>An elderly Gardener lives there, and he mentions the huge plant pot on the table.</p>
<p>He needs a legendary Seed and Fertilizer to fill the pot with.</p>
<p>Since I don&#39;t have either one, I look for the &quot;green bed&quot; flag next...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I check the screencaps from my previous comments to look for a green bed...</p>
<p>Aha! It&#39;s way back at Mario&#39;s house! I head there!</p>
<p>I find Dry Bones&#39;s flag!</p>
<p>Now to find Big Boo&#39;s flag...the hardest one of them all.</p>
<p>I start looking at locations with an O and an A: Marrymore, Booster Pass...</p>
<p>Maybe Big Boo wasn&#39;t talking about a location name, but a place where an O and are...</p>
<p>I cheat a bit and check Monstro Town&#39;s map to look for that place...I&#39;m not going through the <em>Alundra</em> rigmarole. I don&#39;t have time.</p>
<p>I head to Yo&#39;ster Isle, and jump on Yoshi!</p>
<p>I talk to a red Yoshi who gives Yoshi cookies so he can beat Boshi!</p>
<p>I manage to find Big Boo&#39;s flag, literally in between an O and an A, where the hedges say &quot;GOAL&quot; at the end of the racing track!</p>

<p>Raz and Raini are also here too. But, Raz couldn&#39;t saddle up on Yoshi...Raini still loves him anyway...awww... <img class=emojione alt=❤ title=:heart: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2764.png></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/xQuus5z.png alt="raz and raini" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I head back to Monstro Town!</p>
<p>Looks like I&#39;ll have to hold off on the race against Boshi a bit longer...</p>
<p>I rest again, to meet with the 3 Musty Fears once more!</p>
<p>They congratulate us, and give us &quot;the grand prize giveaway&quot;: a <strong>Ghost Medal!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Musty Fears:</strong> &quot;Don&#39;t forget what we told you!&quot;</p>
<p>And with that, they vanish!</p>
<p>They seem to have unequipped Mario&#39;s Safety Ring, and put on the Ghost Medal while he was sleeping!</p>

<p></p><h2 class=entry-title>Super Mario RPG - Part 60a: Culex, Take One</h2><p></p>

<p>I head back to Seaside to restock on some supplies before heading back to Monstro Town...</p>
<p>I admit I spoiled myself a bit for this encounter. I&#39;m a bit excited now...</p>
<p>I head for the the third door, the locked door...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/yGQ5Np3.png alt="shiny stone shines" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The <strong>Shiny Stone</strong> now reacts to the sealed door! And the seal&#39;s been broken!</p>
<p>We enter through the door!</p>
<p>We&#39;re now in a &quot;Place Between Dimensions&quot;...a creature comes forth!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/qLeaeT1.png alt=creature width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/2CLmV5C.png alt=greetings width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Culex:</strong> &quot;<strong>I am Culex, Dark Knight of Vanda.</strong> I have crossed into this dimension to fight for the Dark Mage. But, this world is unhabitable for me and my kind. I must return to my own world. Before I go, though, I would like to challenge your strongest knight. Will you accept my challenge? You will enter combat against me?&quot;</p>
<p>I reconsider and swap out Mallow and Geno for Peach and Bowser first before coming back and taking him on...</p>
<p><strong>Culex:</strong> &quot;You have returned to accept my challenge? Now will you fight me?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Yes.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Culex:</strong> &quot;<strong>En garde!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Allez!</strong> </p>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/12rOdMEDP4o><em><strong>Final Fantasy IV</strong></em> <strong>boss music time!</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Culex:</strong> &quot;<strong>I am matter...I am antimatter...I can see your past...I can see your future...I consume time...</strong> <em><strong>and I will consume you!</strong></em>&quot;</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/dJ8Cjfj.png alt=culex width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Now four crystals drop in front of Culex!</p>
<p>I have Bowser and Peach hit the Earth Crystal, and Mario the Water Crystal with Super Flame!</p>
<p>The crystals hit us with Light Beam, Flame Wall, Ice Rock, and Boulder respectively!</p>
<p>And Culex&#39;s attack makes it game over!</p>

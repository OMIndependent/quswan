<p>Now how do I get to the sewers?</p>
<p>I leave the Mushroom Kingdom. Looks like the map&#39;s showing me my next destination...</p>
<p><img src=http://i.imgur.com/Mfc8Pvv.png alt="map new area" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>After taking the &quot;To Kero Sewers&quot; route, I&#39;m now in a new part of the map, yessss!</p>
<p><img src=http://i.imgur.com/9uWtjLm.png alt="new area yes" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Mallow shows us the entrance: an ordinary green pipe...they also tell us to &quot;watch out for &#39;Belome&#39;, whoever that is.&quot;</p>
<p>Another warning from Mallow: some parts of the sewers might be dark...</p>
<p>Mallow jumps in first, with Mario following.</p>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/7kAkh0s4UGc>The sewers have some creepy organ music...</a></p>
<p>I save my progress at the nearby block in the sewer before moving forward.</p>
<p>I jump in the water...so Mario <em>can</em> swim in this game...</p>
<p>I make it to the other side and read a nearby note that tells me how to warp in a green pipe.</p>
<p>I sink into the pipe, where I&#39;m now in another area...</p>
<p>There&#39;s Cheep Cheeps in the water...</p>
<p><img src=http://i.imgur.com/kk5SUYb.png alt="cheep cheep" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Two separate pipes are located at the landlocked corners of this part of the sewer.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I take the pipe in the southwest corner. As soon as I get off, I touch a rat, but he runs away as soon as the battle begins!</p>
<p><img src=http://i.imgur.com/hXiQ6F1.png alt="battle hobgoblin" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We get some <strong>Pure Water</strong> as a reward after beating the Hobgoblins, which &quot;defeats ghosts in a wink!&quot;</p>
<p>I go back to the Cheep Cheep area, and take the northeast pipe...</p>
<p>Boos are also here too, huh?</p>
<p>I use the <strong>Pure Water</strong> to take care of the Boo, and have Mario and Mallow take care of the Shadow...</p>
<p>So the rats are called Rat Funks, and they&#39;re very quick to run away!</p>
<p>I avoid the Rat Funks coming out of the niches as I head up to the pipe at the top.</p>
<p>On the way, I get a Flower in a chest, along with a <strong>Star</strong> in the next area, hitting a Boo...</p>
<p>I swim through the sewers to head into another pipe. I think I just ended up walking around in circles...</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a Rat Funk ambushes me, and Mallow gets poisoned by one of them!</p>
<p>Dangit, I should&#39;ve brought some Antidotes...</p>
<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> When I wrote this, I did not know that Antidotes don&#39;t exist in-game since the poison wore off after that battle.</p>
<p>The Shadow casts an <strong>Endobubble</strong>! I wonder what that did to Mallow, since Mallow&#39;s now shaking...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I make it to the end of the area, where I see a chest, which has...a <strong>Mimic</strong>, or a <strong>Pandorite</strong>!</p>
<p><img src=http://i.imgur.com/xR7eOPI.png alt=pandorite width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The Pandorite&#39;s pretty tough...and a bit creepy...</p>
<p>Pandorite&#39;s attacks are usually fire-based, with a <strong>Scream</strong> ability.</p>
<p>I get 30 coins and a <strong>Flower Jar</strong>, with Mario leveling up! He also has a new ability, a <strong>Power Jump</strong>! I increase Mario&#39;s attack and defense power.</p>
<p>In the chest is a <strong>Trueform Pin!</strong></p>
<p>I head back and swim away, only to come face-to-face with Cheep Cheeps, or Gobys.</p>
<p>Mallow levels up and learns a new ability as well! I boost Mallow&#39;s attack and defense.</p>
<p>Mallow&#39;s new ability works like a <strong>Scan</strong> or <strong>Libra</strong> spell in <em>Final Fantasy</em>...</p>
<p>After all of those battles, I head back out of the sewers to the Mushroom Kingdom to buy more supplies, and stop here for now!</p>

<p><strong>Frogfucius:</strong> &quot;I have the latest news, children. A large star&#39;s been sighted on Star Hill.&quot;</p>
<p>With that advice, we head over to Star Hill.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/cIiBcPE.png alt="world map star hill" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/phbnzzgya_s>The place looks very mysterious, its music ethereal...</a></p>
<p>I have Mario head up to a sign that reads that the huge star with a keyhole next to it is a Star Gate leading to Marrymore. All I have to do is to talk to the flower, and the gate will open.</p>
<p>I have Mario check out the other Star Gates...there&#39;s only two: the west goes further into Star Hill, and the east Marrymore.</p>
<p>After talking to the flower near the west gate, the keyhole widens enough to let us through!</p>

<p>After crossing through, Geno explains that we&#39;re in Star Hill, where the wishes of the people fall down here. But, unfulfilled wishes are falling because the Star Road is broken.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a lizard and a nearby mole, which after touching the mole, turn out to be enemies!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/qBCSEHo.png alt="mukumuku battle" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>In a battle with the two moles, or the <strong>Mukumuku</strong>, I get another &quot;LUCKY!&quot; flower!</p>
<p>While activating the flowers, I realize I can also talk to the smiling little stars, or the wishes. One wants to start a family, another hopes their baby is cute, a third wishes they had Cricket Jam (Frogfucius!)...</p>
<p>I touch a bandit in blue, and I get caught into another battle with him and two <strong>Pulsars!</strong> The thief runs, and one of the Pulsars performs Migraine, KO&#39;ing Mallow!</p>
<p>After taking care of them, Bowser gains another level! I increase his attack!</p>
<p>While looking for the next flower, I stumble upon reading a wish that Mallow gets angry at us for looking at! Oops!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/cSw4p0j.png alt="mallow angry" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Mallow apologizes and shakes his head, saying he&#39;s embarrassed about his wish. It&#39;s okay, Mallow. It&#39;s my fault for looking...</p>
<p>I light up the five flowers, opening the next gate!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>In the next area, I read Toadofsky&#39;s (?) wish: he wants to get a new melody.</p>
<p>Two bandits in blue, the <strong>Sackits</strong> (until one runs away!), two Mukumukus, and two <strong>Geckos</strong> now...</p>
<p>The Mukumuku&#39;s attacks consist of them throwing stuff, from fish to Bob-ombs, to bones! <img class=emojione alt=â˜¹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>The Geckos, though, are more dangerous, and have Sleep-Sauce, Fun and Run, and Venom Drool!</p>
<p>I wonder what Mukumuku&#39;s <strong>Missed Me!</strong> move does?</p>
<p>After the battle, I switch Mallow for Bowser!</p>
<p>I look at another wish, probably from Chef Torte, who wants to be a world-class baker.</p>
<p>Another new monster I&#39;m facing: the <strong>Mastadoom</strong>...</p>
<p>One wish has someone wanting to be a treasure hunter, another wishes Mallow would find his way home...</p>
<p>Mallow jumps in shock!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ppeg83l.png alt="mallow shocked" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The wish is from Mallow&#39;s actual parents!</p>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/kbamoPhIanc>Mallow begins to sniffle</a>...but stops himself, and tells Mario we should move forward!</p>
<p>I head over to the next area.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>After lighting up five flowers, I find the fourth Star Piece at the north crevice! Aha!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/3lHCm44.png alt="fourth star piece yes" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We get the fourth Star Piece! Yes!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/P2f6INj.png alt="mario star piece get" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Here&#39;s the progress I&#39;ve made so far!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/32hTwwu.png alt="four star pieces" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>&quot;<strong>You&#39;ve come a long way, but your journey&#39;s not over yet. There are 3 more Star Pieces.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Now let&#39;s get out of here!</p>
<p>After lighting the sixth flower, the gate opens!</p>
<p>Before I head out, though, I read another wish from Luigi...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/l4QzWYS.png alt="better plumber" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I wonder where Luigi is in this game?</p>
<p>I cross through the gate, which takes me back to the World Map!</p>

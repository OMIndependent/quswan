<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>The Birdys at the doorway are gone, meaning we can go back and forth into the palace!</p>
<p>I almost forgot that I had a Flower Jar! I use the item after buying more mushrooms and syrup at the item shop!</p>
<p>But, I have Mario turn back after leaving the item shop, since I think I remember looking at the map of this area that there&#39;s a Surprise Block in the shop...</p>
<p>Aha! There is one, with a Frog Coin inside!</p>
<p>I have Mario rest at the inn and save before taking on the palace again!</p>
<p>Inside the palace, I head straight ahead, where I have my first encounter with the fan monster, or the <strong>Pinwheel</strong>!</p>
<p>Back at Birdo&#39;s room, where Birdo tells us not to forget about Birdo! <a href=https://youtu.be/WSpFpOYVQrY>Is Birdo waxing lyrical at us for fun?</a></p>
<p>We head straight ahead using the key Birdo gave us to unlock the door forward.</p>
<p>But, an angry Pinwheel blows Mario away down to the chambers east and below! Poor Mario...</p>
<p>After coming back and facing the Pinwheel, Mario levels up, and learns <strong>Ultra Flame</strong>, yes!</p>
<p>I boost his attack and defense!</p>
<p>Mallow levels up too, learning <strong>Star Rain!</strong> I increase his magical stats!</p>
<p>There&#39;s a Jawful practicing his fork work, blocking out way toward the door.</p>
<p>I look through the map again, noticing there&#39;s a hidden chest block above the chest block on the top of this room. Inside is another Frog Coin! So that makes it 10 now.</p>
<p>Avoiding the Jawful&#39;s fork, we&#39;re now in the next room, which is an empty hallway, but there&#39;s a note near a locked door in the middle of the hall.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Mallow calls to Mario, and has us read the note!</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>King Nimbus is resting in bed.<br> 
Absolutely no running in the halls.<br>
Queen Valentina</strong>&quot; </p>
<p>Mallow&#39;s going to be reunited with his biological family!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/NUi6Lzp.png alt=reunited width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>But he can&#39;t get into the room because it&#39;s locked, and Valentina probably has the key...</p>
<p>Bowser pitches in to barge the doors open!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/c8NOSgE.png alt="mallow stop bowser" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>But Mallow stops him! Mallow&#39;s thinking not to make too much noise if he really is ill. He suggests another plan: to go to Valentina and get the truth about King Nimbus.</p>
<p>Bowser&#39;s still weeping over being stopped midway in his door-busting rampage...hee...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/bTgpeUw.png alt="dont mention this!" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>But Bowser turns to Mario, very angry that he&#39;s been found out crying, and to &quot;never <strong>EVER</strong> talk to the leader of the Koopa Troop like that&quot; again.</p>
<p>A Shy Away flies and sees Mario, but ignores him to report to Valentina, about something...</p>
<p>Before the throne, a Heavy Troopa blocks the doorway.</p>
<p>I decide to switch Mallow for Bowser for this battle alone.</p>
<p>And Bowser learns <strong>Bowser Crush!</strong> I give him a physical stat boost.</p>
<p>Fearing a boss fight, I save my progress before heading to confront Valentina!</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Now the Shy Away goes to meet Valentina, informing that Mario, the &quot;Mario who defeated Smilax,&quot; is in the palace.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/TvfFOBt.png alt="shy away report" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Valentina:</strong> &quot;Mario...!? What...does a &#39;Mario&#39; look like?&quot;</p>
<p>The Shy Away describes Mario as an &quot;it,&quot; and mentions his &quot;Bushy mustache, long sideburns, [and] pair of &#39;mean looking&#39; legs!&quot;</p>
<p>Valentina notices her recognition of Mario from before, then the statue of Mario appears before her, like an unseen thought bubble, giving her the &quot;V&quot; sign.</p>
<p>The Shy Away&#39;s restless, and asks what their next move is...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/J5Zaiyp.png alt="key is mine" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>So Valentina did lock up the king! The King probably wasn&#39;t ill after all!</p>
<p>And she laughs her rich woman&#39;s laugh, but Dodo pecks at her to get her attention. She...doesn&#39;t take too kindly to it.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/PQDIoHu.png alt="SHUT UP" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Dodo turns his head, to tell Valentina that Mario&#39;s here.</p>
<p>Mallow&#39;s angry! He demands that she give the key to where the King&#39;s locked up immediately!</p>
<p>He charges at her, but slips on the step!</p>
<p>Valentina calls Mallow rude, and asks who Mallow is.</p>
<p><strong>Mallow:</strong> &quot;I&#39;m the REAL prince, that&#39;s who!&quot;</p>
<p>She really hates it when people listen in on her private conversation. Mallow points out that her private conversation could be heard from a &quot;10 mile radius!&quot;</p>
<p>Valentina decides to hightail it out of the castle.</p>
<p>My god, what an adultist coward she is...</p>
<p>The Shy Away and Dodo follow suit.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We chase after them!</p>
<p>In the long hall of Bluebird sentries now, where I save my progress at the nearby block.</p>
<p>The <strong>Bluebird</strong>s are known for their icy spells!</p>
<p>The Troopa Shell&#39;s stunned one of the Bluebirds!</p>
<p>Scanning them, they call us &quot;magnificent&quot; for some reason.</p>
<p>There&#39;s also a chest block high above. And a yellow platform block leading up to it!</p>
<p>Inside&#39;s a Star! I use it to knock Bluebirds away, and Dodo too!</p>
<p>Outside now, where there&#39;s nothing but sky!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/3Kbv0kN.png alt="mario falls" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Mario falls down from the clouds, and down to the hot spring entrance below!</p>
<p>Now to get back to Valentina, who&#39;s now running back into the palace!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/SdQkuNa.png alt="citizens ask" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>All the townspeople now flock to Queen Valentina, asking if the King&#39;s recovery is going well, along with what&#39;s happened with the Queen, and the &quot;Prince.&quot;</p>
<p>Valentina can&#39;t hold the pressure of being a leader of the people anymore...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/bxTLxBH.png alt="know what i think" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>She jumps and slams the ground, silencing the crowd.</p>
<p>She tries to call Dodo...who&#39;s nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>Mario raises his fists, and it&#39;s battle time!</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Valentina floats down gently in her &quot;dramatic&quot; entrance.</p>
<p><strong>Valentina:</strong> &quot;Dodo! Dodo! Come here this minute!&quot;</p>
<p>He comes forth!</p>
<p><strong>Valentina:</strong> &quot;Don&#39;t just sit there! <strong>HELP ME!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Dodo now abducts Peach, taking her away from the rest of the party, and it&#39;s now a one-on-fight against Dodo!</p>
<p>I have Peach use up one Red Essence, making her invulnerable for now!</p>
<p>Dodo uses <strong>Flutter Hush</strong>, which silences Peach!</p>
<p>Eventually, Peach gets Dodo to run away!</p>
<p>Now, it&#39;s Mallow and Mario vs. Valentina!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/hZctKwo.png alt="valentina battle" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>She performs a Water Blast as her first salvo, no good!</p>
<p>Scanning her: &quot;I tell ya, he&#39;s NOTHING!&quot; She&#39;s probably gloating that she could finish off Mario quickly!</p>
<p>A few turns later, Dodo returns!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/i5glMbB.png alt="dodo return" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Along with Peach!</p>
<p>The battle&#39;s as tough as Birdo&#39;s &quot;playtime,&quot; since Dodo has a Multistrike attack, and Valentina has her arsenal of spells!</p>
<p>Scanning Dodo, he&#39;s starving...poor Dodo...</p>
<p>Now Valentina unleashes Petal Blast...oh no...</p>
<p>We finally finish her off!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/bJNllqr.png alt="i dont believe this" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Valentina:</strong> &quot;The show&#39;s over, folks! Dodo...! Let&#39;s get outta here!! Well, everyone...until we meet again!&quot;</p>
<p>Dodo carries her away. She does her rich woman laugh as she flies away...</p>
<p>Peach levels up, learning <strong>Psych Bomb!</strong> I increase her health.</p>
<p><a name=6></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Mallow&#39;s not too pleased that she got away, since she has the key to open King Nimbus&#39;s chamber!</p>
<p>Then the key drops from the sky, knocking Mallow out!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/wbN3K1g.png alt="key drop ack!" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Mallow picks up the key and runs into the palace!</p>
<p>Mario, knowing that Mallow&#39;s going to be filled with emotion, pulls out Peach&#39;s parasol...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/R0v48W0.png alt="rain at nimbus" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The sky clears up after awhile, and Mallow arrives where the actual King and Queen await at the throne!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/j4ROLAV.png alt="king and queen nimbus" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>King Nimbus&#39;s mustache is as super bushy as Mario&#39;s, or maybe even more...</p>
<p>Mallow introduces everyone else to his parents!</p>
<p>King Nimbus gives all of us his gratitude, and introduces himself as Mallow&#39;s father.</p>
<p>Queen Nimbus says hello to everyone, and thanks us for looking after Mallow.</p>
<p>King Nimbus asks for Peach&#39;s autograph, and the Queen tells him not to embarrass Mallow...hee...</p>
<p>King Nimbus thanks Mario, but realizes he&#39;s the Mario! The &quot;Jumping Mario!&quot; He now wants his autograph!</p>
<p>Queen Nimbus tells the king &quot;that&#39;s enough.&quot;</p>
<p>King Nimbus then asks Mario to jump. Mario does a jump, with some gymnastics!</p>
<p>The King goes down the list of characters, awed by the fame of Mallow&#39;s allies, he also wants Bowser&#39;s autograph too!</p>
<p>After Mallow introduces Geno, Queen Nimbus mentions a large star that fell into a volcano...</p>
<p>Everyone reacts in shock.</p>
<p><a name=7></a></p>
<hr>
<p>King Nimbus knows it&#39;s tough since there&#39;s a dragon involved. Oh god... <img class=emojione alt=☹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/361qp8m.png alt="czar dragon" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>King Nimbus almost goes into his flashbacks, which Queen Nimbus ignores and tells the party to find a person named Hinopio in the volcano.</p>
<p>She tells Mallow to be careful.</p>
<p>King Nimbus tells Mallow he&#39;s proud of him. Awwww... <img class=emojione alt=❤ title=:heart: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2764.png></p>
<p>We now head out through the back to get the chests there...the chest block that had a Star now has a Flower inside!</p>
<p>I fail since I fell at the wrong spot, and I decide to try again.</p>
<p>Back at the palace, all the statues of Valentina are replaced with likenesses of King Nimbus!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/JF0jAyq.png alt="king nimbus statues" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>At the room where Birdo used to nest, there are now statues of us!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Sjgu7jO.png alt="mallow and heroes" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>One of the citizens points out Geno&#39;s statue looks a bit &quot;unworldly.&quot;</p>
<p>We talk to the now-rehired guard in the chamber where the king and queen were locked up.</p>
<p>Mallow thanks him, and he tells us not to mention it, telling Mallow that he did the work of rescuing the King.</p>
<p>He gives Mallow a parting gift: a Flower Jar!</p>
<p>I fail to get the treasures again!</p>
<p>After saving, I find out the Royal Bus is still being repaired...</p>
<p>Another failed attempt at getting the treasures later, I decide to go to the hot spring. Now that Mallow has been confirmed as the real prince, we can pass forward.</p>
<p>The guards warn us not to fall into the volcano below...</p>

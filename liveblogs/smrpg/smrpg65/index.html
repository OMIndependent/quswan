<p>Off to Nimbus Land we go!</p>
<p>I take the left bouncepad and I&#39;m now in the town proper! The place feels like an Adventure Time-esque city in the clouds!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/8teKrK8.png alt="cloud citizens" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Someone, however, yells to get the citizens at attention!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/hQufTiS.png alt=attention width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Her name is <strong>Valentina</strong>. She mentions the King is not getting any better, and that the town will be losing its ruler... <img class=emojione alt=☹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p><strong>Valentina:</strong> &quot;<strong>But!</strong>...It just so happens that I have found the missing Prince! Prince Mallow, that is!&quot;</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait, so Mallow&#39;s the prince, and he&#39;s with us...shouldn&#39;t he be inside waiting for Valentina&#39;s cue?</p>
<p>Valentina summons &quot;Prince Mallow&quot; in a...rather courteous manner that Scorpion would applaud her for.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/MDMr9F4.png alt="get over here" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Valentina announces that the &quot;Prince&quot; has &quot;stage fright,&quot; and heads inside to tell the &quot;Prince&quot; to hurry up!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, &quot;Prince&quot; Mallow can&#39;t get through the doorway...</p>
<p>There&#39;s the Prince, who doesn&#39;t look like a cloud person at all...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/lylRytm.png alt="prince mallow?" width=480 height=360></p>
<p>Everyone welcomes the &quot;Prince&quot; with open arms, but are still a bit surprised at the appearance of the &quot;Prince&quot;...</p>
<p>The &quot;Prince&quot; asks Valentina for something...she thinks he&#39;s being serious, and doesn&#39;t know what to say...</p>
<p>She announces immediately that she will marry &quot;Prince&quot; Mallow!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/p3NGS3g.png alt=marriage width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Valentina is internally relishing the thought of being the Queen of Nimbus Land for some reason...she dismisses the citizenry...she tells the &quot;Prince&quot; to hurry up back there.</p>
<p>Mallow&#39;s surprised too, because he sees a Prince with the same name as his! Maybe it&#39;s because <strong>you&#39;re</strong> the real Prince, Mallow!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Mallow tells us we should be finding the rest of the Star Pieces.</p>
<p>I head for the inn first and save there.</p>
<p>I talk to one of the citizens outside, who tells us that he was fired by Valentina after one day for no reason and says the king needs him...</p>
<p>I head into the shop, where there&#39;s new gear, such as Fuzzy armor, a <strong>Mega Glove</strong> for Mario, a <strong>War Fan</strong> for Peach, a <strong>Hand Cannon</strong> for Geno, and a <strong>Sticky Glove</strong> for Mallow!</p>
<p>I buy the Fuzzy equipment and the new weapons, and some items.</p>
<p>Outside, I talk to another cloud citizen, who doesn&#39;t like the new guards there...</p>
<p>I head into Garro the sculptor&#39;s house, where he&#39;s at the far end of the house, his back turned.</p>
<p>Wait, is that golden sculpture...?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/duKhTpd.png alt="is that" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The citizens still think the big black bird is Prince Mallow!</p>
<p>One citizen, who used to work in the palace, mentions &quot;poor Dodo&quot; and the mistreatment he gets from Valentina... <img class=emojione alt=☹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Another has never heard of Star Pieces, but he&#39;s watching the volcano below...</p>
<p>One remembers the actual Prince as small and timid...</p>
<p>There&#39;s even a royal bus that the King used to use...</p>
<p>We now try to go forward into the castle, but the Birdys don&#39;t like people barging in...</p>
<p>I head up west, where I think this might be where the Royal Bus is usually parked....</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/RynDaxr.png alt="patch of cloud" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I head back to the inn, where the innkeeper offers a Dream Cushion for 60 coins...technically, it&#39;s 30 coins for the night, and 30 more for the cushion. I have Mario accept the night&#39;s stay with the cushion.</p>
<p>Mario has dreams of Chef Tortes working and walking around, surrounded by huge ingredients...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/WoYbcsl.png alt=dream width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Now where should we head off to next?</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I have Mario head back to the sculptor, maybe he knows something...</p>
<p>He says that he&#39;s now ordered to make sculptures for Valentina, who&#39;s taken up residence in King Nimbus&#39;s castle.</p>
<p>We go near the sculpture.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/2JBA4OR.png alt="hey look its me" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Mallow notices himself in the sculpture! But, Garro comes and says that it&#39;s actually King Nimbus when he was younger!</p>
<p>Garro then does a double take...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/DO11mC2.png alt="who are you!?" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Mallow introduces himself, and Mario, to Garro.</p>
<p>Garro rejoices at Mallow&#39;s return!</p>
<p>Mallow jumps super super high in shock!</p>
<p>Mario then starts his charades, explaining everything that&#39;s happened to the sculptor.</p>
<p>He imitates the scene where Frogfucius said that Mallow is <strong>NOT a tadpole</strong>, even Mallow&#39;s reaction.</p>
<p>Garro confirms that our Mallow is the real prince of Nimbus Land.</p>
<p><strong>Mallow:</strong> &quot;Mario! Look at me! I&#39;m a prince!&quot; ^O^</p>
<p>Mario stoops his head low.</p>
<p><strong>Garro:</strong> &quot;I knew Valentina was up to something! I just didn&#39;t know what...that must mean that the King really isn&#39;t gravely ill...!&quot;</p>
<p>Mallow wants to go save the castle now! Mallow&#39;s now super angry and pumped up!</p>
<p>But the Birdys stop him...</p>
<p>Mallow returns, disappointed.</p>
<p>Garro, though, has a plan to get us in the castle, all we have to do is say the word, and he will prepare the plan...</p>
<p>I save and stop here.</p>

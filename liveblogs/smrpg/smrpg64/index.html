<p>I really want to get to this place that I accidentally spoiled myself on when I read the Bean Valley map, so I head back to Booster Tower...</p>
<p>I wish this game had an item bank of sorts, but probably that would make this game too easy.</p>
<p>There&#39;s one of the clowns we fought earlier!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/oN6RX4D.png alt="knife guy?" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I touch him, no battle encounter, thank goodness, so I have Mario talk to him!</p>
<p><strong>Knife Guy:</strong> &quot;Hee hee hee heee...I&#39;m...really, REALLY sorry about before...here, I&#39;ll make it up to ya! Hee haaaaaw...are we having fun yet?...Hee hee hee.&quot;</p>
<p>What are we doing now?</p>
<p>Knife Guy mentions that that was just practice, now for the real thing.</p>
<p>I accept his challenge, whatever his &quot;real thing&quot; was.</p>
<p>He tells us to watch for which hand the yellow ball is in.</p>
<p>I guess the left one! I win...a <strong>Wilt Shroom</strong>, or a Wilted Shroom, which only heals 10 HP!</p>
<p>I try his challenge again.</p>
<p>Everytime I win, I get Wilted Shrooms. Is this a joke? I heal Mario and Geno with them, though.</p>
<p>I try again.</p>
<p>After playing his juggling shell game three times, I get a different prize, a <strong>Rotten Mush!</strong>, which heals 5 HP... <img class=emojione alt=â˜¹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>After a few more challenges, I get a <strong>Moldy Mush</strong>!</p>
<p>The juggling shell game seems to be more quicker this time, or shorter on one instance!</p>
<p>I throw away all the bad mushrooms...</p>
<p>One final game with Knife Guy, and he congratulates me!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/RDRpHUU.png alt="congratulations frm kg" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>This time, he gives me...a <strong>Bright Card!</strong> Yessss!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/wROm06E.png alt="wherever that is" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Just like the sleeping Toad in Marrymore said, there is a Casino!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I decide to scale Booster&#39;s Tower again!</p>
<p>In one battle, I get double XP! Yes! Peach levels up to 17! So does Geno, and he learns a new move: <strong>Geno Flash</strong>! I boost their attack and defense!</p>
<p>Atop the balcony, we see Booster and his Snifits, with his mouth wide open, waiting for his next bride...eeeeee....</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/4CBlGJp.png alt="next bride" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Mario wisely backs away...</p>
<p>In the stairway of marching Spookums, I get the last hidden chest block, which has a Frog Coin!</p>
<p>Now I head back to Bean Valley.</p>
<p>I find out on the way that I can only carry 999 coins at a time!</p>
<p>We&#39;re here! I save near the five pipes and wait for the Shy Away to water the Piranha Plants so I can take them on again.</p>
<p>I sink into the top pipe!</p>
<p>After taking on the Chomp Chomp, I have Mario jump in the corner near where he stood. Hearing the super mushroom audio cue, I&#39;m getting somewhere!</p>
<p>Three jumps later, the yellow platform and the passage opens!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/iLUyKMR.png alt="secret passage" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>So the Bright Card was the key that opened the way in, huh?</p>
<p>I take the platform block and head in the passage...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Q3btcs0.png alt="casino map" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>...back to the world map!</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The casino outside looks like a big house.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/yhskoHL.png alt="casino house" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I have Mario enter.</p>
<p>There are two Toad doormen in suits blocking the way to the casino.</p>
<p>They let us pass inside.</p>
<p>And here is one half of the Guys, Grate Guy!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/1QvBx9r.png alt="casino inside" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>So now, let&#39;s see what we can do here...</p>
<p>I have Mario talk to Grate Guy again, who&#39;s concerned about Booster&#39;s bride search.</p>
<p>After looking around, where there&#39;s a blackjack table, I talk to Grate Guy again, who offers to play &quot;look the other way&quot; with him.</p>
<p>I have Mario say yes.</p>
<p>So the game is to either press left or right on the control pad and make sure Mario&#39;s facing the other way where Grate Guy&#39;s raised finger is.</p>
<p>After losing the first game and winning the second, I get another Rotten Mush!</p>
<p>Grate Guy and Knife Guy are really bad at being good...</p>
<p>After a few games, I win a few Mushrooms, but mostly Wilted Shrooms and Moldy Mushs.</p>
<p>I stop after awhile and play the slot machines, which is a slot machine chest block. Since I have 999 coins, I put them to good use.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not that lucky my first try.</p>
<p>The second try I get three Stars, and the Frog Coin as a prize!</p>
<p>For the blackjack table, it costs 1 Frog Coin to play!</p>
<p>No beginner&#39;s luck for me this time!</p>
<p>I leave and save at Monstro Town.</p>
<p>Well, I thought the casino would have more minigames in it...</p>

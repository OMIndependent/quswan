<p>I go through the cannons, remembering that I launch Mario the moment I hear the bell ring!</p>
<p>On the way to the cliff, Bowser makes it to level 16!</p>
<p>Mario also gets hit with a Funguspike, which turns him into a Mushroom!</p>
<p>I have Mallow heal him, but Mario gets turned into a Scarecrow by a Fink Flower!</p>
<p>Once more into the sand whirlpools...</p>
<p>...and now I&#39;m back at the cliff, where the Sky Troopas have assembled, with Sgt. Flutter at the top of the cliff!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/usIhHQD.png alt="sgt flutter at cliff" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Our &quot;mission,&quot; according to Sgt. Flutter, is to climb the cliff by jumping on each shell.</p>
<p>It&#39;s basically a moving platform minigame of sorts...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/BoNatxt.png alt="jumping cliff" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>It took me 27.16 seconds to make it up the cliff!</p>
<p>On to Bean Valley!</p>

<p>The aesthetic looks pretty autumnal here, and there are two pipes to go to...which one should I take? I have Mario go to the western one.</p>
<p>But that&#39;s a dead end...</p>
<p>With these Stinger battles, Geno gets lucky twice because he has a chance to attack three times in one turn, with these &quot;ONCE AGAIN!&quot; flowers!</p>
<p>Peach reaches level 16 as well! I upgrade her magical stats.</p>
<p>I switch Mallow out with Peach...</p>
<p>...and head into the western pipe in the second area.</p>
<p>In one battle, Peach gets turned into a pink Mushroom!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/IUwEX0B.png alt="pink mushroom" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>After that battle, Geno reaches level 16! I upgrade his health!</p>
<p>I then head into the southern pipe, which takes us to a place where a chest block is...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/A1KYB5o.png alt="chest block area" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Inside the chest block is a Flower!</p>
<p>Back to the previous area, and up north, and we&#39;re now at an area filled with Piranha Plant-filled pipes!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/E70N8A3.png alt="piranha plant pipes" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>A Shy Away is guarding the area...</p>
<p>And a save block&#39;s up north! I save my progress at this point.</p>
<p>Looks like the Piranha Plants are waking up and biting! It turns out the Shy Away&#39;s watering them!</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We get into one battle with one Piranha Plant, or a <strong>Smilax</strong>, blocking the pipe ahead!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/MIrDkjF.png alt="smilax battle" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We take care of that one immediately, but the Shy Away comes, singing a tune, watering his precious plant! This time, the Piranha Plant has two heads now!</p>
<p>I&#39;m betting we have to face two more heads after these two...</p>
<p>Their usual attacks are Flame and Drain, pretty moderate spells.</p>
<p>After taking care of the heads, the Shy Away comes back with &quot;recycled&quot; water!</p>
<p>My mistake, we&#39;re now facing <strong>three</strong> heads!</p>
<p>They can also perform <strong>Pollen Nap</strong> as well...</p>
<p>I have Geno use his <strong>Geno Blast</strong>, Peach her <strong>Group Hug</strong>, and Mario his <strong>Super Jump</strong>!</p>
<p>After taking care of these heads, the Shy Away comes back with more water with nutrients!</p>
<p>Oooooooh boy...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/dAtkGNM.png alt=megasmilax width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>A <strong>Megasmilax</strong>, or a mega Piranha Plant head&#39;s now in the mix!</p>
<p>The smaller plant heads can now attack twice!</p>
<p>The Megasmilax&#39;s <strong>Petal Blast</strong> turns everyone into mushrooms! He can also turn one into a Scarecrow!</p>
<p>Thank goodness for Peach, her Group Hug cures everybody!</p>
<p>But the Megasmilax turns everyone into mushrooms again! Now, it&#39;s a matter of waiting...</p>
<p>Geno&#39;s the first to be cured!</p>
<p>Mario and Peach eventually turn back!</p>
<p>I try using Peach&#39;s new <strong>Mute</strong> spell on the Megasmilax, no good!</p>
<p>I manage to have Mario (while he&#39;s a scarecrow!) to perform 7 Super Jumps in a row!</p>
<p>Now I have Mario do that again, getting 13 Super Jumps on the Megasmilax!</p>
<p>I also use up my last Able Juice on Peach!</p>
<p>Eventually, the Megasmilax has no FP left!</p>
<p>And with one turn, he&#39;s finished!</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The Shy Away is not happy that we took care of Smilax...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/jdErrZI.png alt="shy away scared" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The Shy Away&#39;s now in a bind, fearing for his life! He mentions a <strong>Queen Valentina</strong>, and <strong>Nimbus Land</strong> in passing! His next move: to run away!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/DVl631z.png alt="shy away shys away" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>While flying away, a note drops from the sky!</p>
<p>The note is actually a bag, which contains a <strong>Seed</strong> that I have Mario take!</p>
<p>I have Mario sink into the next pipe, which leads us to an area with a brick block! Knowing how Mario games work, this block probably grows vines out of it!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/tj7FKbW.png alt="brick block" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>After hitting it, the block freezes, and the beanstalk grows from it!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ArmOlhH.png alt=beanstalk width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Mario&#39;s jumping in shock again!</p>
<p>The narration&#39;s in awe too! &quot;<strong>Wow! Did you see that? It&#39;s a magical beanstalk! Hit the block once more to climb it.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>I have Mario hit the block again, and we climb...</p>
<p>...to the skies!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/yl6gnNu.png alt=clouds width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I have Mario climb another vine further higher, avoiding the flying red eagle with a pole!</p>
<p>I read a note showing me how to climb the vines from the Nimbus Department (they don&#39;t make broomsticks, though!) and proceed.</p>
<p>This is slightly tricky...as I try to gather a few floating coins...</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>But as I try to reach the blue vine, I get into a battle with the red eagles, and their friend, the <strong>Heavy Troopa</strong>!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/tiyw29e.png alt="birdy heavy trooper" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The monsters here are pretty strong, as a <strong>Grinder</strong> attack from a <strong>Birdy</strong> (the red eagle) shows!</p>
<p>The prompt above notes that &quot;Heavy Troopa&#39;s ready for launch!&quot; Looks like he&#39;s getting ready for an attack... <img class=emojione alt=â˜¹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>With Geno&#39;s Geno Blast and Mario&#39;s 10-jump Super Jump combo, we finish them off!</p>
<p>As I have Mario climb the blue vine, I notice there&#39;s another Frog Coin!</p>
<p>Through several attempts, I manage to get the coin!</p>
<p>In the next area now, at the top of the red vine, there&#39;s a chest block with a Flower inside!</p>
<p>Now for the gold vine...</p>
<p>I manage to make it higher, but another Frog Coin&#39;s floating next to the second gold vine there...</p>
<p>After climbing the second green vine to get the gold coins, Mario falls, and I try again.</p>
<p>The positioning on the vine is important here...and I usually miss reaching the vine...</p>
<p>After a battle with a Birdy, we get an <strong>Energizer</strong>. In their place, a yellow platform appears!</p>
<p>I give up trying to get the second Frog Coin, and climb higher to the third area...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/cMnz36h.png alt="second vine" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>More vines to climb higher, plus the isometric camera&#39;s making it hard for me to tell whether Mario&#39;s actually climbing the vine or not...I press on anyways.</p>
<p>By defeating the Birdy and their friends, the platform makes it a bit easier to tell where each vine is....</p>
<p>As I reach higher, <a href=https://youtu.be/5LYwswH1bQA>the music changes</a>...we seem to be getting somewhere now.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a smiling bouncepad on the left, and a bouncepad on the right that can take us back...</p>
<p>I have Mario fall down the hole ahead, where there are two guards blocking the way to the hot spring...</p>
<p>I take the east bounce pad back and save at Monstro Town.</p>

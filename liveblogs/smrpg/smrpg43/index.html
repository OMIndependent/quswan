<p><a href=https://youtu.be/jkpqPHCvBA4>Here&#39;s the music for Marrymore.</a></p>
<p>I wander around the inn, talking to the guests. One sleeping Toad mentions a Casino in the town. One couple wants to stay in the suite, but it&#39;s a bit pricey.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/rxEVOsL.png alt="lobby hotel" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I buy some stuff from the shopkeeper, who&#39;s also the innkeeper, and his wares range from Happy equipment (<strong>Happy Pants</strong>, <strong>Happy Shirt</strong>, etc.) to a <strong>Super Hammer</strong>! I buy a new weapon for Geno, and a few Mid Mushrooms, and Maple Syrups.</p>
<p>Now I climb up the steps to face Booster...</p>
<p>But the guests at the chapel are outside, probably kicked out by Booster and crew! One guest mentions that they were in the middle of a ceremony before the Snifits came in...</p>
<p>The about-to-be wedded couple, Raz and Raini, are thrown out of the chapel by the Snifits!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/o1UJkZL.png alt="snifit chapel" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Snifit 1 mentions that they&#39;ve barricaded the door to prevent anyone interfering!</p>
<p>The small Toad in the green-dotted cap is shaking. The narration says he really needs to go!</p>
<p>I talk with the rest of the guests outside. One mentions that it&#39;s the first time a &quot;perfect couple isn&#39;t going to live happily ever after...&quot;</p>
<p>One Toad is in shock that the &quot;totem pole&quot;-faced Booster is marrying the Princess.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/lTa7sTE.png alt=married!? width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I talk to the Snifit behind the doors, who says the front is locked, and tells us not to go to the back either, since it&#39;s locked, or he thinks it is! Lol! Thank you, Snifit!</p>
<p>We go around back to interrupt the wedding...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>There&#39;s a short crate I can jump on, but where&#39;s the back way to the chapel?</p>
<p>I almost forgot that I have a Flower Jar I need to use, which I do!</p>
<p>I accidentally stumble upon the back door, and head down to where two chefs are making the cake.</p>
<p>I have Mario jump on the wedding cake!</p>
<p>Chef Torte, and his apprentice, are not happy, and they shout us down from the cake!</p>
<p><strong>Chefs:</strong> &quot;<strong>You fools!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>I climb the stairs, where the Snifit is barricading the door!</p>
<p>The Snifit tells Mario (he thinks it&#39;s not Mario, since he believes that he can&#39;t get through the front), and Bowser &quot;can take a hike...and jump on out!&quot;</p>
<p>I have Mario jump to make sure that it is Mario who he&#39;s talking to.</p>
<p>Snifit 1 tries to run to his boss to alert him...but the door&#39;s shut tight.</p>
<p>He asks for our help in opening the door!</p>
<p>It&#39;s all about timing, the Snifit tells me, as I take a few tries with the Snifit in busting the chapel doors wide open...</p>
<p>We have to hit the doors at the same time to open them. I&#39;m really bad at this part...</p>
<p>We eventually barge in, with Snifit 1 tackling Snifit 2, and opening the anteroom doors!</p>
<p>They now alert their boss that we&#39;re here to stop him!</p>
<p>Booster tells them not to interrupt him, and to shut the doors!</p>
<p>Peach calls out to us.</p>
<p>I save at this point before proceeding.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The Snifits have no doubt they could stop Mario, but they didn&#39;t count on Bowser...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/WxJO81u.png alt="bowser shows his might" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Bowser:</strong> (laughs) &quot;Gwa ha ha ha! I&#39;m lightning in a bottle! I&#39;m an earthquake in a can! I&#39;ll bust this [door] open in no time!&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser then tries to bust the door open, but fails!</p>
<p>This is probably like with the Snifit in the previous door.</p>
<p>I have Mario talk to Bowser, and it&#39;s confirmed.</p>
<p>We barge through the doors, where we charge past the barricading Snifits, which pushes Peach down, who falls, and Booster, to the altar!</p>
<p>Peach is having it no more!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/YcPwk2O.png alt="my things" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>She cries...poor Peach... <img class=emojione alt=â˜¹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Booster tells the Snifits not to interrupt him again, and starts the ceremony, but he notices Peach crying.</p>
<p>He thinks she&#39;s &quot;leaking&quot; water from her eyes, and tastes her tears. They&#39;re salty, he says.</p>
<p>Snifit 2 points out to Booster that she&#39;s crying. Booster&#39;s still not over the taste of Peach&#39;s tears, which according to him, taste &quot;like the sea.&quot; My god!</p>
<p>They point out to him that her wedding stuff fell off of her. He tells them to pick up her gear before Mario comes in, unaware that he&#39;s here!</p>
<p>Mario jumps at attention!</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The ceremony continues, and before the Snifits hop to finding Peach&#39;s gear, one of them tells Booster to switch places with Peach, as he&#39;s supposed to be on the right, and her on the left.</p>
<p>The Snifits then find Peach&#39;s wedding stuff in the pews...</p>
<p>...except for the Crown! I hurry and ask the Snifits for Peach&#39;s stuff back, and grab the crown from Booster&#39;s head, and talk to Booster.</p>
<p>Peach rejoices, but she jumps very high in fright!</p>
<p>Because of Bowser appearing with Mario...</p>
<p>She does trust Mario though, and is about to give him a kiss...</p>
<p>Bowser interrupts, pointing out that he also saved her, therefore he deserves that kiss.</p>
<p>Booster&#39;s now angry too and is stomping furiously. He also wants a kiss. My god...lol...all this for a kiss...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/l7Koj28.png alt="anger at chapel" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Peach is getting confused, and then starts to kiss Mario...</p>
<p>...but she misses and Booster kisses Mario instead!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/keefXB6.png alt="booster x mario" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Lol!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/NO43IFI.png alt="waht the" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Peach giggles at the sight.</p>
<p><strong>Peach:</strong> &quot;Now <strong>that&#39;s</strong> one for the scrapbook!&quot;</p>
<p>She requests Mario for her leave back to the Mushroom Kingdom.</p>
<p>Booster has a bad feeling his wedding is going to be crashed, which it already is!</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Chef Torte and his apprentice enter the chapel with the cake! They&#39;re now...angry that Mario&#39;s leaving with the princess...and that there&#39;s no one to eat their cake!</p>
<p><strong>Chefs:</strong> &quot;<strong>You fools!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>We now get into a battle with the Chef, his apprentice, and the cake! Oh my god!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/2tXtBQh.png alt="chef cake battle" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The Chefs, or the <strong>Tortes</strong>, are invincible, but their layer cake, called <strong>Bundt</strong>, is not!</p>
<p>Their slapping attacks are called <strong>Stop It!</strong> and <strong>Stop! Stop!!</strong></p>
<p>I have Mario perform <strong>Super Flame</strong> on the cake, no good!</p>
<p>After ruining their cake a few times, the Apprentice pokes Chef Torte.</p>
<p>He notices their cake&#39;s moving!</p>
<p>Chef Torte&#39;s riding on the &quot;inconceivable&quot; train, and the battle continues!</p>
<p>We hit the cake some more!</p>
<p>The Apprentice now notices the cake&#39;s moving again!</p>
<p>Chef Torte thinks he&#39;s lying again!</p>
<p>Now it&#39;s moving! They both jump in fright, and run away!</p>
<p>The cake&#39;s alive!</p>
<p>The cake&#39;s candles are now lighting up!</p>
<p><a name=6></a></p>
<hr>
<p>While taking a short break, I accidentally switch the game off while I was trying to pause it! Aaaaasajfskljldsfksgjdljkdfjkls!</p>
<p>Lucky I saved before the altar, though!</p>
<p>Back to the battle. The cake now performs two moves at once! A <strong>Mega Drain</strong> and a <strong>Diamond Saw</strong> are its first attacks!</p>
<p>This cake knows a wide variety of attacks! And they are strong ones, especially the Diamond Saw!</p>
<p>We eventually blow out the candles and take care of the top layers...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/1NyjLRt.png alt="top layer gone" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>So the cake&#39;s a Raspberry flavored one, huh?</p>
<p>Now I see why the cake can attack twice, it&#39;s two monsters in one, or a two &quot;layered&quot; monster!</p>
<p>After some damage at the cake, the Snifits interrupt us, and tell us not to damage Booster&#39;s cake further!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/5lLyZSf.png alt="snifits stop" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Booster comes along, and he&#39;s not happy that his cake is about to be ruined!</p>
<p><strong>Snifit 1:</strong> &quot;There&#39;s a 70% chance that the object you&#39;re standing on is a cake...&quot; Lol!</p>
<p>Booster&#39;s surprised that he&#39;s standing on the cake! He jumps off, and wonders next how they&#39;re going to eat this...he decides to boil the cake! He asks his Snifits if that&#39;s agreeable...</p>
<p>Too messy, Snifit 2 says.</p>
<p>Snifit 2 proposes swallowing the whole thing as it is!</p>
<p>The Snifits encourage Booster to eat the cake. But, he doesn&#39;t jump at the challenge immediately, feeling underprepared for it...</p>
<p>The Snifits circle around the cake.</p>
<p>Before he eats it, though, Booster notices that it&#39;s moving! He senses something&#39;s not right.</p>
<p>The Snifits then <strong>throw</strong> the whole cake at him!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/NqVoXil.png alt="booster eat cake" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Booster tastes the cake...</p>
<p>...it&#39;s so delicious that he cries in joy! Lol...</p>
<p>The Snifits announce the wedding&#39;s over now!</p>
<p>Booster &quot;calls it a wrap&quot;, and he and his minions leave the chapel...</p>
<p>End of battle!</p>
<p><a name=7></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Mallow levels up, learning <strong>Shocker!</strong> I upgrade Mallow&#39;s health!</p>
<p>Peach labels Mario &quot;her knight in shining armor.&quot;</p>
<p>Peach is still in shock that she almost got married to Booster, or as she calls him, &quot;that thing!&quot;</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Orgo9qy.png alt="peach joins us" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Yes!!!</strong></p>
<p>Princess Toadstool, aka Peach, is a playable party member too! I wonder what her abilities are?</p>
<p>So Peach is a healer, with <strong>Therapy</strong> and <strong>Group Hug</strong> as her spells!</p>
<p>I also have her equip Booster&#39;s &quot;bad smell[ing]&quot; Amulet, which delivers a status boost to everything!</p>
<p>I leave the chapel and save at the anteroom.</p>

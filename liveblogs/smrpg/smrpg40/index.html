<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>Now I chase after Booster as I head into a room with a green switch button...</p>
<p>Out of curiosity, I press it...</p>
<p>Some loud rumbling and shaking&#39;s going on...the prompt tells me to check out Booster Pass...</p>
<p>As I head to the world map, I notice no changes around the area.</p>
<p>Aha! It seems like I opened a passageway to the western part of the pass!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/aoLeZrF.png alt="opened passage" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I&#39;m now in an area filled with Spikies, with a Spookum running around the area!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we fall off the edge....</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/OOZ0oeU.png alt="roll down" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>...and roll back down to the foot of the pass!</p>
<p>I head back through the tunnel and carefully cross the path.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/3lpjjVG.png alt="apprentice bump" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Then I bump into the Spookum, who&#39;s an apprentice of sorts...but he wants to beat us in combat so he can be Snifit 4!</p>
<p>The Apprentice can cast a <strong>Bolt</strong> spell! We take care of him quickly.</p>
<p>After we take care of him, he&#39;s now disappointed because he has to take the training course all over again in the tower...he runs away!</p>
<p>I repeatedly skip over the numerous chasms to reach the end of the passageway.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/d9tkYf2.png alt="treasure chests" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Hmmm, three chest blocks...I wonder what&#39;s in them?</p>
<p>The north one has a Frog Coin, the west one has a <strong>KeroKero Cola</strong> (since my inventory is full, I toss out a Maple Syrup), and a Flower in the east chest!</p>
<p>I head back to Booster&#39;s Tower by taking the short way downhill, where Mario rolls until he lands at the foot of the pass again, and heading out to the map.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I climb back up to the green switch room, fighting some Rob-ombs along the way...</p>
<p>I also realize what the Remo Con&#39;s <strong>Eerie Jig</strong> does: it turns one of my party members into a Scarecrow! In this case, it&#39;s Geno who gets affected!</p>
<p>In the next floor, I have Mario jump up the stairs and go through a pair of curtains and  a pillar in the middle of the hall...</p>
<p>...and Mario transforms from a 3D!Mario into NES!Mario! <a href=https://youtu.be/l1axGPMaTrU>With music!</a></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/e4FubMI.png alt="flat mario" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>As I move Mario out of the room, Mario shrinks, <a href=https://youtu.be/GWBx3Hf3n4g>plus panic music</a>, and panic poses! Mario goes back to the curtain to turn back to normal...</p>
<p>Mario shakes his head, wondering what just happened...</p>
<p>Now at the next corridor, where Spookums on top of blue blocks block our way forward.</p>
<p>In one battle, we encounter an <strong>Orb User</strong>. I wonder what their powers are?</p>
<p>So the Orb User&#39;s a spellcaster...</p>
<p>On the third floor of the room, Bullet Bills come charging...</p>
<p>I have Mario avoid them, and have him jump on top of the Snifit firing them!</p>
<p>No battle encounter with the Snifit here...</p>
<p>I head into the next hall west, where I sneak past Rob-ombs to get to a save block in the next room...</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The music&#39;s changed back to the entrance music as I enter the next hall, filled with paintings of Booster&#39;s ancestors.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a door with a big keyhole, along with a note next to the door.</p>
<p>I ignore them and cross into the next room, where I have Mario jump up to see a seesaw with a Thwomp on it!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ZFlOePW.png alt="thwomp seesaw" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The Thwomp&#39;s force pushes us up to the higher parts of the tower!</p>
<p>I have Mario leap back down to go back to the room with the paintings.</p>
<p>The note reads: &quot;<strong>Take a look at Booster&#39;s family portraits from the oldest to the youngest.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>I look at last week&#39;s posts to solve this puzzle, since I know I took some screencaps of the Booster clan&#39;s paintings at the entrance hall...</p>
<p>After turning the last painting, Booster (?) pops out from behind the painting and throws out a key!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/DuGEMRt.png alt="booster throws key" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>It&#39;s the <strong>Elder Key</strong>, which opens the Ancestor Hall, or the door with the big keyhole!</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Inside the room is a sleeping Chain Chomp...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/2MpXX25.png alt="zzz chain chomp" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I wake the Chomp up with a leap on the top, and the Chomp starts barking!</p>
<p>Bowser gazes at the Chain Chomp intently...he leaps at the Chomp, landing on the block!</p>
<p>Bowser points out the Chain Chomp&#39;s a &quot;bit shy&quot;...he tells Mario to turn away while Bowser &quot;soothes&quot; the Chomp...</p>
<p>He mentions that she&#39;s been locked up by Booster ever since she bit him...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/iyc9IXs.png alt="bowser chomp" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>...so now he helps her get revenge!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/bbK0XaW.png alt="bowser swing" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We finally get a Chomp!</p>
<p>In the equip screen, the description about the Chomp says: &quot;Just spin me at an enemy!&quot;</p>
<p>After a few struggles jumping up to the Thwomp on the seesaw, we make our ascent up the tower!</p>
<p>This part of the tower feels like a prototype of a <em>Super Mario 64</em> level...</p>
<p>I take care not to touch any of the Spookums...</p>
<p>At a tiny invisible corridor, I have Mario leap to get a Frog Coin!</p>
<p><a name=6></a></p>
<hr>
<p>In the next room, there&#39;s a bunch of coins scattered around...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/92GbZBb.png alt="coin trap room" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I feel like this is a trap room...</p>
<p>...and I&#39;m right! As I have Mario avoid the coins, something poofs and two <strong>Fireballs</strong> ambush us!</p>
<p>Bowser also levels up! I increase his physical stats...</p>
<p>After getting the first Frog Coin in the room, I&#39;m ambushed again!</p>
<p>Frustrated, I look online to find tips on how to solve this room, and avoid any traps...</p>
<p>I head back to the room with the parachuting Spookums, as I found out <a href=http://faqs.neoseeker.com/Games/SNES/super_mario_rpg_booster_tower.gif>from this map</a>, there&#39;s a hidden chest block with a Frog Coin in it!</p>
<p>After getting that, I head back to the room, gingerly taking my time collecting everything without stepping on a Fireball trap!</p>
<p>But I fail and get into another encounter! </p>
<p>Geno, after beating one Fireball, gets a &quot;<strong>LUCKY!</strong>&quot; flower!</p>
<p>At the end of the battle, I&#39;m treated to a little gambling shell, or Yoshi egg, game, where I bet my XP on finding Yoshi!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/VzRjdlJ.png alt="challenge the system" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I get a birdie, which is a tie...so I still keep the XP I gained!</p>
<p>Checking the map carefully again, I also pick up a Room Key that unlocks the north door!</p>
<p>After collecting most of the coins I carefully make my way to the north room, which has a chest block with <strong>Zoom Shoes</strong> inside!</p>
<p>The Zoom Shoes boosts one&#39;s Speed by 10! I have Bowser equip the shoes.</p>
<p>On other Fireball encounters, I also get more chances to get a &quot;LUCKY!&quot; flower, and I succeed at doubling my XP! I&#39;m betting these bonuses pop up since I have the <strong>Lucky Jewel</strong>.</p>
<p>A few ambushes (and more chances for double XP) later, I leap back down the tower to save my progress.</p>

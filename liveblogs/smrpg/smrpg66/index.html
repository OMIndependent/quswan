<p>Alright, now to head inside the castle!</p>
<p>I switch Peach for Mallow.</p>
<p>Next stop: Garro&#39;s house, where he tells Mario to stand still for awhile. He&#39;s probably building a sculpture for us...</p>
<p>The preparation process has Garro pop in and out around Mario.</p>
<p>Mario&#39;s now painted in gold, like a sculpture!</p>
<p>Garro tells Mario not to move for now, and Mario stays still in his running pose!</p>
<p>Garro takes Mario and extra statue before the Birdy guards, and we make our wy into the palace.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/2Sx5fTn.png alt="birdy palace" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>But the Birdys stop the delivery, and notices that one of the statues doesn&#39;t look like Valentina...he&#39;s about to prod Mario...</p>
<p>Garro steps in and says that&#39;s a statue of Valentina&#39;s nephew...lol...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/doxx2SM.png alt=mariotta width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The Birdy turns from Mario to Garro and back again...</p>
<p><strong>Birdy:</strong> &quot;Uh...ok. Proceed.&quot;</p>
<p>We now enter the palace.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/pZDpJIOpgVA>The music inside has some cembalo, or harpsichord, in it</a>, along with a <a href=https://youtu.be/R_e-6t34Cwc>canned laugh...</a></p>
<p>Garro points out that there&#39;s no such person as &quot;Mariotta.&quot;</p>
<p>Valentina enters in her Nanami-esque, rich woman laugh. She&#39;s impressed by her own likeness in the sculpture.</p>
<p>Garro thanks &quot;her majesty&quot; for the compliment, and leaves...</p>
<p>But Valentina stops him!</p>
<p>She&#39;s now questioning Garro on the &quot;ugly thing&quot; before her: Mario.</p>
<p>Garro said he created it just for her...called &quot;<strong>A Plumber&#39;s Lament</strong>&quot;. Lol...</p>
<p>Garro then goes through the details of his &quot;masterpiece.&quot;</p>
<p>Poor Mario...lol...</p>
<p>Garro mentions the well-defined legs of Mario, &quot;of the masses&quot;...hee...</p>
<p>Valentina is still skeptical, then praises the &quot;work of art.&quot; She tells Garro that only he can sculpt &quot;with such gentle beauty and...raw power!&quot; Is this game making a jab at art critics in general?</p>
<p>Garro leaves. Valentina now glances at the &quot;statue&quot;...she praises it again and calls Dodo.</p>
<p>She tells Dodo to carry the statues in...</p>
<p>After she leaves, he pecks one of the Valentina statues. He really doesn&#39;t like her, or his job, probably...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/T0CsmDA.png alt="valentina peck" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Dodo then drags the statues and places them in a small room, where Mario&#39;s on a special pedestal.</p>
<p>I have Mario jump out!</p>
<p>I save at this point, and head past the doors.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>But! Valentina yells at Dodo on the other side of the doorway, and is not satisfied with how he placed the statues!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/0i5d4pZ.png alt="statues correct?" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>She orders him to polish the statues, and to hurry up with it.</p>
<p>Mario jumps back to the pedestal.</p>
<p>But, since Dodo&#39;s in a bad mood, I&#39;m now treated to another another minigame, where I have to avoid Dodo&#39;s pecks, and hope he doesn&#39;t hit Mario. This is very similar to hiding behind Booster&#39;s curtains.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/94VNYvK.png alt="get ready" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I manage to avoid him for two pecks!</p>
<p>But Dodo catches me on his third attempt!</p>
<p>He then runs to Valentina and says that one of the statues was ticklish...</p>
<p>Now for the second try...</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I get caught again!</p>
<p>Valentina tells Dodo if he&#39;s suspicious about the &quot;statue,&quot; then he should peck at us once more!</p>
<p>He slowly retracts his beak, and I&#39;m now in a battle with him!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/aODsVp0.png alt="dodo battle" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I decide to reset and try the minigame again...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/DeKiGOX.png alt="dodo peck" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>It&#39;s when Dodo flaps his wings and starts flying and pecks that I usually get caught by him...</p>
<p>On the fourth try with this minigame, I survive, yes!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/yfNiJnl.png alt="mario v" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>As a reward for the minigame, I get a <strong>Feather</strong> dropped on the ground by Dodo!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/iGo75xe.png alt=feather width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I save my progress here, and head through the door.</p>
<p>I hope that&#39;s the last time I go through one of those minigames again...</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Outside now, where two Birdy sentries are flying. Mario hides on top of the nearest empty pedestal.</p>
<p>They&#39;re really tired of being guards, but think it&#39;s better than taking Dodo&#39;s job, where he has to polish Valentina&#39;s statues, and be at her call at all times.</p>
<p>The Birdys prod and prod at Mario until he jumps super high in pain!</p>
<p>The Birdys now notice Mario moving and ask themselves if statues move...lol...</p>
<p>They think Mario&#39;s one of those new lifelike, animatronic statues and run away!</p>
<p>I head outside to the entrance hall and make a left, where there are green Shy Guys patrolling.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a fan on full blast prevents us from going forward.</p>
<p>I go to the other side and jump down, where I&#39;m back at the same hall again.</p>
<p>After going back and getting the chest block, I get caught by one of the Birdys and a fight ensues!</p>
<p>Scanning one of the Birdys...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/3hQvVsK.png alt="i hate valentina" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Poor Birdy though, he&#39;s not in a very good working environment...</p>
<p>I check to see if I missed any hidden treasures in that room. None so far.</p>
<p>One of the Birdy statues come to life in the next hall, and the hooded figures, the <strong>Shaman</strong>s, here are not our friends.</p>
<p>I manage to grab another Flower from a chest block!</p>
<p>I then get into a battle with <strong>Sling Shy</strong>s (the green Shy Guys), two Shamans, and a <strong>Jawful</strong>, who&#39;s sleeping.</p>
<p>I have Peach wake him up with her fan!</p>
<p>The Shamans are strong spellcasters, while Jawful&#39;s a physical and defensive powerhouse!</p>
<p>If I time it right, I can block all the attacks these enemies are giving me!</p>
<p>I head into the next hall, right, and down a stairway, where a Jawful&#39;s guarding the way forward.</p>
<p>After another battle, I play another shell game, which I lose XP at, and proceed further, where I meet the King&#39;s subjects.</p>
<p>I save at the save block nearby before talking to them.</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>One servant asks if I knew hot springs existed around Nimbus Land. I have Mario say yes, and the servant tells me that she wanted to be the first one to tell Mario about them.</p>
<p>I have Mario talk to another servant, an ex-guard, who says he was fired by Valentina. He offers his master key, which I take.</p>
<p>I equip the Feather to Bowser, no stat changes though.</p>
<p>Another servant gives us a Flower Jar!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/6dBPR96.png alt="egg in palace" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Another one tells me about the huge egg in the middle of the palace, which spits out eggs, and they bounce off if we time our block right!</p>
<p>One servant mentions the benefits of hot springs to the King.</p>
<p>But where is the King?</p>
<p>I head back and grab a chest block containing a Mushroom inside, restoring our health...</p>
<p>I head to the west passage, which is blocked by fan monsters and Sling Shys! Not going through there!</p>
<p>Back near the subjects&#39; room, we stumble upon a hidden corridor, and a Surprise Block, which has a Frog Coin!</p>
<p>I have Mario jump and open the last Surprise Block in the room, which has another Frog Coin.</p>
<p>Now it&#39;s back to the subjects&#39; room and save again.</p>

<p>The tower does look like an upside-down pyramid of sorts...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/9dp2QIn.png alt="booster tower map" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>At the foot of the tower, we run into...<strong>Bowser!</strong> He&#39;s looking at Booster&#39;s Tower, missing his castle on the hill, and pondering about the &quot;good old days&quot; where he was the main villain.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/1x1SO1P.png alt="good ol days" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Bowser:</strong> &quot;I miss the good old days...Toadstool screaming in terror, Mario rushing in to save her...&quot;</p>
<p>As he turns around to face us, Bowser&#39;s weeping like <a href=https://media.tenor.com/zjI1m5BXnusAAAAC/steven-universe-crying.gif>Steven</a>...and jumps at the sight of Mario!</p>
<p>Then he turns his back to him, telling himself to calm down, and not let Mario see him in that state.</p>
<p>Bowser tries to be &quot;nice&quot;. Almost sounding like Mhxb cenpgvpvat uvf zbabybthr jura ur gevrf gb or tbbq. I also notice someone&#39;s peering at the entrance from the inside...is that Booster?</p>
<p>He then turns away again for a bit, trying to get more &quot;confidence&quot; in himself.</p>
<p>He asks Mario in a not-nice way what he&#39;s doing at the tower.</p>
<p>Bowser then mentions Peach would be crying if he were to kidnap her...</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Peach is in the tower&#39;s balcony, weeping. She then hears voices from below, but doesn&#39;t believe it&#39;s them...she peers down...</p>
<p>Peach&#39;s reaction is priceless!</p>

<p><strong>Peach:</strong> &quot;Mario~!!! I&#39;m up here!&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser&#39;s glaring at me, or at the camera...and recognizes Peach! He&#39;s now laughing, and decides to head back to his castle!</p>
<p><strong>Bowser:</strong> (to Mario) &quot;<strong>Outta my way, shortie!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>He jumps, causing the ground to shake, shifting Mario to the left, and leaves.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I have Mario go to the door. It&#39;s locked...</p>
<p>As soon as we go to leave, <strong>whoosh!!!</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Bowser comes back!</strong></p>
<p>That was quick!</p>
<p>Bowser realizes that we&#39;re trying to rescue Peach, and tries to get all the glory for himself!</p>
<p><strong>Bowser:</strong> (to Mario again) &quot;<strong>Outta my way, shortie!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>He rams his shell through the door!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/U0h3ExD.png alt="koopa troop" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Bowser&#39;s now thinking that we want to join him! Bowser&#39;s saying that he&#39;s probably going to regret doing this...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/79o03OB.png alt="koopa troop join" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>In his mind, we&#39;re the ones joining Bowser&#39;s &quot;Koopa Troop&quot;, not the other way around...</p>
<p>What a surprising turn of events!</p>
<p>I also get asked for a tutorial on &quot;Switching&quot; allies...I say yes.</p>
<p>Toad pops up again for the explanation. Hi Toad!</p>
<p>So I can switch up to 2 allies to go into battle with, but I can&#39;t take Mario out for a rest...</p>
<p>I got spoiled with the fact that Bowser (naq Crnpu gbb) was going to join the party eventually, but I didn&#39;t realize how easily <strike>he</strike> we would join <strike>us</strike> him!</p>

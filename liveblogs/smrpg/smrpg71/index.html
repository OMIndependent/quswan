<p>Now let&#39;s get back to this fiery mess!</p>
<p>We&#39;re now at the upper ledges of the cavern, where the giant monster we fought used to be...</p>
<p>I make a left, then get caught into another battle with an <strong>Oerlikon</strong> trying to jump to the higher parts of the cavern, and his two friends: Chained Kong and Armored Ant!</p>
<p>The Armored Ant has a few tricks, such as a fear-inducing Endobubble, and a self-boosting skill!</p>
<p>I manage to avoid the waking Vomer on one of the steps...</p>
<p>In the next chamber, there&#39;s more Oerlikons, and another giant monster blocking the way forward...</p>
<p>What to do at this point? What to do?</p>
<p>I decide to say &quot;whatever&quot; and face the Corkpedite!</p>
<p>I take care of the giant monster first...</p>
<p>Without his body, the Corkpedite collapses in the next turn!</p>
<p>I get into another battle that I run away from!</p>
<p>In the next area, I have another battle with another giant monster, a short-fused Stumpet!</p>
<p>When Stumpet gets angry, he unleashes his volcanic Backfire, hitting Mallow with severe damage!</p>
<p>But we finish him, and Mario, and Mallow level up!</p>

<hr>
<p>In the next area, I have Mario get the chest block filled with 100 coins. We also see an imposing Toad with flames on his cap. This must be Hinopio...</p>

<p>He introduces himself as so.</p>
<p><strong>Hinopio:</strong> &quot;This place is a regular INFERNO! Come on, step inside!&quot;</p>
<p>We head into his store: the Hino Mart.</p>
<p>There&#39;s some model planes in the corner, and the left one is an Arwing. I don&#39;t know about what the other planes are, though...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/flTUyjM.png alt=planes width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I check Hinopio&#39;s wares after looking around for any Surprise Blocks.</p>
<p>He has an item shop: with Mid Mushrooms, Maple Syrup, and other general goodies.</p>
<p>He also has an inn.</p>
<p>I check the armor shop: all of it is all Fire equipment! I take the lot and equip everyone with Fire armor!</p>
<p>After switching Mallow for Bowser, I leave Hino Mart on the east exit.</p>
<p>After taking our leave, Hinopio goes back to guarding his store.</p>
<p>I save at the nearest block and take a look at the next area. It&#39;s filled with lava and flame monsters! Noticing my FP is low, I rest up, save again, and stop here.</p>
<p>The resting spot in Hino Mart is just a bunch of crates!</p>

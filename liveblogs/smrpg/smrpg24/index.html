<p>I go off to Rose Town. It&#39;s now more brighter after we took care of the Smithy Gang member...</p>
<p>All the Toads thank Mario for saving the town! </p>
<p>Arrows aren&#39;t falling from the sky now!</p>
<p>Using the Toad as a platform, I jump up to the house on the cliff...</p>
<p>I get the chest blocks, which have Flowers in each of them...</p>
<p>I head upstairs and press on the green switch to lower the staircase outside.</p>
<p>I head outside and the Toad thanks me for lowering the stairs! He asks me if his treasures were okay...<em>*gulp*</em>...oh god...were those chest blocks his &quot;treasures&quot;?</p>
<p>I lie and say &quot;sure they were&quot;, and run quickly to the shop.</p>
<p>Checking the menu, I use the Flower Box I got from defeating Bowyer to increase my flower points by 5!</p>
<p>After restocking on items (and selling some), I head to the inn.</p>

<p>I speak to Gaz, and he gets his mother to have her see Geno...she thinks it&#39;s just a person in a costume...</p>
<p>Gaz wants Geno to play with him, but Geno tells him he has to go look for Star Pieces...</p>
<p>Geno then explains to Gaz everything so far, with Mario and Mallow pantomiming the scenes in the Forest Maze...</p>
<p>Geno asks if he gets it. <strong>Nope.</strong></p>
<p>Everyone falls flat on their faces...lol...</p>
<p>Geno then says to Gaz that nobody&#39;s wishes won&#39;t come true unless he finishes his task: to collect the Star Pieces and restore Star Road.</p>
<p>After Gaz says that Mario needs all the help he can get...Mario goes after him! But Mallow stops him. Oh Mario...</p>
<p>Geno promises Gaz that he will fix Star Road.</p>
<p>The party joins back into Mario...but Gaz stops them! Geno and Mallow bump into Mario instead!</p>
<p>Gaz then goes to the corner to get something, and gives Geno the <strong>Finger Shot!</strong></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/XMfmfws.png alt="finger shot get" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Geno thanks him, and the party, after side-glancing Gaz, forms back into Mario.</p>
<p>I go to the menu, and equip the <strong>Finger Shot</strong> to Geno.</p>
<p>Gaz&#39;s mother asks how Mario&#39;s feeling (&quot;like a new man&quot;, I chose, with Mario jumping), and thanks him for spending time with Gaz.</p>
<p>I leave to head to our next destination...</p>

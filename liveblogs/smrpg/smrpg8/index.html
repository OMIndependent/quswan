<p>Now heading to <strong>Bandit&#39;s Way</strong>...</p>
<p><img src=http://i.imgur.com/lC2qPnC.png alt="bandits way" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I see the crocodile thief, and Mallow whispers that this is our chance to take his ill-gotten loot!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Croco sees us and runs off!</p>
<p>Now the monsters are here are chasing us! I jump on one Goomba and the battle begins!</p>
<p><img src=http://i.imgur.com/9aEd5On.png alt=frogog width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>That&#39;s a huge reptile!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Mallow took a lot of damage from the creature!</p>
<p>I heal Mallow with the Mushroom! Mallow even says &quot;Thank you!&quot;</p>
<p>We also get a freebie in that battle, a <strong>Mushroom</strong>, I think.</p>
<p>I wander a bit down south and to the west, where I see another save block! I save my progress there.</p>
<p>I then make a detour back to the shopkeeper in the Mushroom Kingdom and buy a pair of <strong>Pants</strong> for Mallow to increase their defense!</p>
<p>In the next area, Croco taunts us as &quot;non-jumpers&quot; and jumps out of our sight!</p>
<p><img src=http://i.imgur.com/y462L8s.png alt="croco jump taunt" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We jump on the spinning flower and make it past the ledge!</p>
<p>We fall into another battle, with a pair of K-9s...</p>
<p>Afterwards, I jump on the yellow platforms to head to the ledge on the other side!</p>
<p>We catch up to Croco and he runs off!</p>
<p>During a battle with three Goombas, I use Mallow&#39;s special ability out of curiosity...</p>
<p>Holy heck!</p>
<p>We now chase after Croco who&#39;s on top of yellow platforms, trying to get more treasure!</p>
<p><img src=http://i.imgur.com/blGNvVs.png alt="croco chest" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Croco says that the chest isn&#39;t worth our time! Oh really?</p>
<p>I use the platforms to get the chest, which has a <strong>Star!!!</strong></p>
<p>I use the <strong>Star</strong> to plow through the K-9s!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Now Croco&#39;s cornered, but he runs off and hides!</p>
<p>Mallow suggests trying to sneak up from behind and catch him!</p>
<p>Almost caught Croco, but he&#39;s a quick one!</p>
<p>He&#39;s still taunting us!</p>
<p>We finally catch up to the slippery croc!</p>
<p><img src=http://i.imgur.com/4CEylzm.png alt="eyes fast" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>But he taunts us again, saying that it&#39;ll take a century to catch him, and he runs off...</p>
<p>Eventually, we catch him twice! He tries to taunt us, but this time, Mallow sneaks up behind him!</p>
<p>Croco then gives up and gives back the coin...<strong>not!</strong></p>
<p>I knew he wasn&#39;t going to give that coin up without a fight...</p>
<p><strong>Boss fight!</strong></p>
<p><img src=http://i.imgur.com/9DBMHYf.png alt="battle vs croco" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>This guy hits hard!</p>
<p>He lobs one of his bombs at us! It hits Mario for massive damage!!</p>
<p>Mallow&#39;s now out of the battle... <img class=emojione alt=ðŸ˜¦ title=:frowning: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/1f626.png></p>
<p>Oh my god, this guy&#39;s healing himself!</p>
<p>After a few turns, I die again!</p>
<p>Croco&#39;s a tough boss!</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I recover from the last place I saved at, which is at the beginning of Bandit&#39;s Way.</p>
<p>Looks like I&#39;ll have to level grind a bit before taking him on again...</p>
<p>I wonder what Frogog, the huge reptile, is shooting Mario with...</p>
<p>Mario levels up to Level 3!</p>
<p><img src=http://i.imgur.com/jiF5Viv.png alt="level up" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Mario learned a new skill! He can now shoot fireballs!</p>
<p>I upgrade his health!</p>
<p>After another battle, Mallow levels up and learns a new skill: <strong>HP Rain!</strong></p>
<p>I upgrade Mallow&#39;s attack and defense stats, save, and do more grinding while chasing Croco again!</p>
<p>In one of the battles, I get an &quot;ATTACK UP!&quot; flower for Mario!</p>
<p>Along with <strong>Honey Syrup</strong> in a bout with three Spikies!</p>
<p>I get a &quot;ONCE AGAIN!&quot; flower for Mario in another bout, giving him another turn!</p>
<p>On my way to fight Croco, I discover another chest in the same area where I found the <strong>Star!</strong> The chest has a flower, upgrading my FP!</p>
<p>I go into the menu, and I notice that I have a <strong>Flower Jar!</strong> I use it up.</p>
<p>After leveling both Mario and Mallow up to 4, I decide to head back to get more items.</p>
<p>I head back to Bandit&#39;s Way and save after stocking up.</p>

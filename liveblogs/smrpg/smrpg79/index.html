<p>I&#39;m going to have to try another door this time to see if it&#39;s any easier there...</p>
<p>Door #2 is another puzzle room with our good friend, Dr. Topper!</p>
<p>Let&#39;s see what puzzle he has under his sleeve!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ep1Coe0.png alt="quiz time" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>A quiz, huh?</p>
<p>I let him go over the rules.</p>
<p>He gives out 12 random questions. If I&#39;m right on one, the platform Mario&#39;s on raises by one level, and if I&#39;m wrong, Mario goes down two levels, and I have to answer in 5 secs. If I don&#39;t make it in time, Mario goes down one level. If Mario makes it to the 8th level, I win!</p>
<p>Quiz time!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I fail at the quiz and Mario&#39;s back to the doors...</p>
<p>Who the heck is Carroboscis? I seem to have forgotten a lot about the game so far now...</p>
<p>I try again...</p>
<p>And again...</p>
<p>And a fourth time!</p>
<p>I finally make it and Dr. Topper gives us a boost to the next door...</p>
<p>In the next room, there&#39;s a pile of barrels in the corner opposite where Dr. Topper is...</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Topper:</strong> &quot;Heh...let&#39;s see how well you can count. Give ya ten seconds...tell me the number of barrels in the room!&quot;</p>
<p>I cheat a bit by looking at the pile before ending the text window...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>But he tells us to close our eyes...and we have 10 seconds before we answer!</p>
<p>I answer right on the first try, but it was a &quot;warm up!&quot; Oh my god...</p>
<p>A yellow platform pushes Mario up to the next chamber where Dr. Topper gives us 20 seconds to guess the number of barrels in the next pile!</p>
<p>I lose count, and after three seconds, I&#39;m back at the doors again... <img class=emojione alt=â˜¹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>I fail at the quiz again too...</p>
<p>But I try once more!</p>
<p>I ace the quiz and barrel counting. Now what&#39;s next?</p>
<p>Dr. Topper&#39;s there barring the door forward, with some little helpers on the side: a Boo, a Goomba, a Dry Bones, and a Cheep Cheep...</p>

<p>Aside from the Monty Python reference, what does he have to offer?</p>
<p>Now it&#39;s a logic puzzle...</p>
<p>I listen to Dr. Topper&#39;s problem, which he says once:</p>
<p><strong>Boo, Goo, Bones, and Kipp competed in a triathlon. The triathlon included swimming, cycling, and a marathon.</strong></p>
<p>I have to guess who came in what position in the triathlon.</p>
<p>I ask Boo: <strong>3rd for swimming.</strong></p>
<p>Goo: <strong>Same in swimming and cycling, but 2 others beat him in marathon.</strong></p>
<p>Bones: <strong>Outrode Kipp in cycling, and Kipp never went past him.</strong></p>
<p>Kipp: <strong>Fell in 4th place during cycling, but ended in the same place as he did in swimming.</strong></p>
<p>This is going to take a lot of thinking...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I guess that Kipp was <strong>1st</strong> in swimming, Goo in <strong>2nd</strong>, Boo <strong>3rd</strong>, Bones <strong>4th</strong>.</p>
<p>In cycling: Kipp <strong>4th</strong>, Goo <strong>2nd</strong>, Boo <strong>3rd</strong>, and Bones <strong>1st</strong>.</p>
<p>In marathon: Goo <strong>3rd</strong>, Bones <strong>1st</strong>, Kipp <strong>2nd</strong>, and Boo <strong>4th</strong>.</p>
<p>So the final tally is: <strong>Bones, Kipp, Goo, and Boo!</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;m right! I proceed to get my final prize!</p>

<p>Now all that&#39;s left is to face the giant sword, and this game will be over...</p>
<p>I have Mario turn the corner, where there&#39;s no floor...uh oh...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/aGvjY75.png alt="mario looks down" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>He falls a small distance, where a save block and the door forward is...</p>
<p>I save at this point and open the doors.</p>

<p>All right, time to jump into Mallow&#39;s hometown, or pond!</p>
<p>I check around the area, even around Melody Bay, no one&#39;s home...</p>
<p>I have Mario stand in front of the stepping stone, and a tadpole comes forth...</p>
<p><img src=http://i.imgur.com/rlX0qAL.png alt=tadpole width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Mallow comes out, and the tadpole tells them the whole pond is aware of Mallow&#39;s journey with Mario, because they stopped Belome!</p>
<p><strong>Mallow:</strong> &quot;See, Mario, the waterways of the world bring news to us here. That&#39;s why Grandpa knows all the news that&#39;s fit to hear!&quot;</p>
<p>The tadpole is surprised at Mario, or &quot;Super Mario&quot;, coming to Tadpole Pond, and calls on everyone!</p>
<p>Holy heck! That&#39;s a lot of tadpoles!</p>
<p><img src=http://i.imgur.com/EJWmCbc.png alt=tadpoles width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Mario proves he&#39;s the real deal by jumping, and he does it in style!</p>
<p>Mallow and Mario raise their hands up in the air!</p>
<p><strong>Frogfucius:</strong> &quot;Well, Grasshopper...what&#39;s new?&quot;</p>
<p>Mallow tells about how Mario helped them out! Frogfucius knows because of the storm that Mallow made when they were crying...Mallow lowers their head a bit...</p>
<p>Some background talk, and Frogfucius? tells someone to make it look like he&#39;s floating...</p>
<p>Enter Frogfucius, Mallow&#39;s grandfather, &quot;floating&quot;...</p>
<p><img src=http://i.imgur.com/731uh6Q.png alt=frogfucius width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>He says that he&#39;s been waiting for Mario.</p>
<p><strong>Frogfucius:</strong> &quot;Yes, &#39;Old Wise People&#39; can often give good advice...&quot;</p>
<p>The Lakitu above Frogfucius lowers him a bit...lol...</p>
<p><img src=http://i.imgur.com/S4KKaPF.png alt="frog lower" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>He orders the tadpoles to form a bridge for Mario to his island.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Mario and Mallow jump to Frogfucius&#39;s island.</p>
<p><img src=http://i.imgur.com/Ti6uKum.png alt="tadpole bridge" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Frogfucius mentions Smithy at Bowser&#39;s castle...but he mentions the &quot;truth&quot; about what&#39;s happened with the Princess...</p>
<p><img src=http://i.imgur.com/HfNKJ68.png alt="peach not there" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Whoa what!?</strong></p>
<p>Mario reacts quickly and rushes at Frogfucius...</p>
<p>Frogfucius tells him to be patient and to let him explain the situation.</p>
<p>He leaps (!) and lands onto the table in one big crash!</p>
<p>So the sword crashing down into the castle separated Bowser and Peach as well...</p>
<p>He mentions that Smithy&#39;s underlings are also running amuck. We took care of Mack...so there are more of the Smithy Gang coming.</p>
<p>Mallow asks Frogfucius about the star piece we found after beating Mack...</p>
<p>Frogfucius says that shooting stars (illogically) &quot;grant wishes&quot;, and believes that the <strong>Star Piece</strong> we picked up might be very important to finish off Smithy.</p>
<p>He asks if we want a recap of the whole story. I say yes.</p>
<p>I listen to the sort-of condensed story so far from Frogfucius...and Mallow&#39;s now realizing the gravity of the situation...</p>
<p><strong>Mallow:</strong> &quot;I guess Mack was the first of many, Mario. Some of [the Smithy Gang]&#39;ll make Bowser seem NICE.&quot;</p>
<p>Frogfucius tells his grandchild that they will be helping Mario in his quest. Mallow&#39;s in shock!</p>
<p>So Frogfucius reveals the truth about Mallow, that Mallow&#39;s...</p>

<p><a href=https://youtu.be/0RkC0c665zg><strong>NOT a tadpole!!!</strong></a></p>
<p><img src=http://i.imgur.com/49ijlvm.png alt="say what" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Everyone plus the Lakitu come to the island in a hurry!</p>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/kbamoPhIanc>Frogfucius tells his story about how he found Mallow.</a> So Frogfucius found Mallow from a basket falling from the Midas falls... (music in link)</p>
<p>Mallow takes this news...as lightly as they can...</p>
<p>Mallow starts sniffling...no, Mallow don&#39;t cry... <img class=emojione alt=â˜¹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Frogfucius stops that with another jaw-dropping leap! He tells Mallow to go with Mario to find their real family...he then calls to Mario and whispers to him if he&#39;ll take Mallow along. Mallow accepts the journey!</p>
<p><img src=http://i.imgur.com/7sSF7BI.png alt="mallow accepts" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Frogfucius tells us to go to <strong>Rose Town</strong> next, and we depart. But, I go back to talk to the wise old frog and he&#39;s sniffling...</p>
<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> While trying to take a screenshot, I accidentally reset the game! Eeeeesafajdfajdfjkls....</p>

<p>He gives us something for the Cricket Pie...he rummages through his chest to gives us the <strong>Froggie Stick</strong>, which I equip on Mallow!</p>
<p>I walk around Frogfucius&#39;s island...the banner behind him reads some music scales...</p>
<p>I also have Mario jump on his table. Frogfucius reacts accordingly.</p>
<p><img src=http://i.imgur.com/QBnVjpa.png alt="dont stand on my table" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>

<p>I leap back onto the mainland, and head west to talk to a tadpole, who runs a &quot;Juice Bar&quot;. Mario has no membership, so the only thing there is on the menu is a <strong>Froggie Drink</strong>. I buy one, filling up my item bag.</p>
<p>I throw away some Pure Waters, and talk to another tadpole in the Juice Bar&#39;s corner, where he heads the shop where I can trade Frog Coins from the Midas River...</p>
<p>Most of the items in stock are stat boosters and speical items. I decide to save up my Frog Coins for later.</p>
<p>Afterwards, I save back at the Midas River.</p>
<p>Honestly, Frogfucius&#39;s character did surprise me a bit...</p>

<p>Now there&#39;s two doors in front of us, and the Magikoopa claims that this castle belongs to Smithy now!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/RX1cK95.png alt="magikoopa red" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The Magikoopa waves their wand and it&#39;s battle time!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/uaSlsYW.png alt="magikoopa boss" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Whoa! So that&#39;s what the Star Gun does!</p>
<p>The Magikoopa is strong against Mario&#39;s jump attacks!</p>
<p>Now the Magikoopa jumps, causing an egg to drop! The Magikoopa casts their magic on the egg!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/toesxQI.png alt="magi magic" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>What&#39;s inside?</p>
<p>A big <strong>King Bomb</strong> is summoned, and the Magikoopa&#39;s hiding behind it!</p>
<p>We take care of him immediately!</p>
<p>Now the Magikoopa casts more magic!</p>
<p>I have Mario use up some Rock Candy...which seems to do heavy damage...</p>
<p>Now what&#39;s the Magikoopa summoning this time?</p>
<p>Another King Bomb, which we take care of quickly!</p>
<p>I boost Geno&#39;s physical power...</p>
<p>One more Lazy Shell attack from Mario, and the Magikoopa&#39;s finished!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The Magikoopa&#39;s robes turn back to their usual blue...Magikoopa doesn&#39;t remember what they did...they say &quot;hi&quot; to Bowser, mentioning that they were brainwashed. They ask if they did something wrong. Uhhh....</p>
<p><strong>Bowser:</strong> &quot;Uh...don&#39;t...worry about it. Let&#39;s just put it behind us.&quot;</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ceDHx0n.png alt="bowser smithy 2" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The Magikoopa&#39;s happy that Bowser has new forces for his Troop, and says that their magic can help them.</p>
<p>The Magikoopa demonstrates!</p>
<p>And a golden chest block that never runs out of coins is the result!</p>
<p>Though, it only gives us one coin per hit...</p>
<p>The Magikoopa is now our healer.</p>
<p>I go back, save, and heal before proceeding further...</p>
<p>Left door first, and Croco&#39;s there!</p>
<p>Croco says that he&#39;s not going to be there all the time, and offers his wares: the same recovery items and new equipment!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/gIZDtQU.png alt="new wares croco" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I buy and equip the whole lot!</p>
<p>As we leave out the door, we get a look into Croco&#39;s thoughts: &quot;See ya!&quot;</p>
<p>I turn back and Croco was also about to leave too! Oh, Croco...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Now into the door to the right...</p>
<p>More lava, and Thwomps shaking and rumbling the whole room!</p>
<p>Along with golden Bullet Bills, which are coming at us from the other side!</p>
<p>I also get caught into some battles while crossing, with the rumbling from the Thwomps making it a bit tricky to move Mario!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/7rxyTvf.png alt=passage width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Now that&#39;s a big Thwomp!</p>
<p>I make it, and I&#39;m now at a hall full of chandeliers, just like in the beginning of the game!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ie6XmSW.png alt=chandelier width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Someone starts laughing...</p>
<p>Mario looks up, and there&#39;s Shy Guys, and a bearded individual.</p>
<p>He&#39;s impressed by our performance so far...too bad that&#39;s the last time he&#39;ll be impressed by us...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/7k3nIjh.png alt="boss of the keep" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Now we have to &quot;deal with [him]!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Boss:</strong> &quot;<strong>EN GARDE!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>And another boss fight begins, atop another set of chandeliers, held up by Shy Guys!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/yrlbCRW.png alt=boomer width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>No chains to attack for this battle, though...</p>
<p><strong>Boomer</strong>&#39;s quick at drawing and sheathing his sword!</p>
<p>Now Boomer invigorates himself and turns blue!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/RKHLein.png alt="turn blue" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>He unleashes his Skewer attack, which does little to no damage...</p>
<p>But in the next turn, he unleashes Shaker, which KO&#39;s Geno! Oh god no...</p>
<p>I have Mario attack him, and have Peach resurrect Geno once more! The match continues!</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The fight is over, but Boomer has final words as <a href=https://youtu.be/i_SDejECbS0>sad music plays...</a></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/wEVgGJC.png alt=argh! width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Boomer:</strong> &quot;This is absurd! I <strong>can&#39;t</strong> be defeated by <strong>them!</strong> I won&#39;t let this happen! I won&#39;t fall in battle...&quot;</p>
<p>He gasps and coughs...</p>
<p>Mario tries to cheer him up by jumping, which Boomer sees as pity and loathes it.</p>
<p><strong>Boomer:</strong> &quot;I am a soldier...I am prepared to go...&quot;</p>
<p>Now he performs his final move: dropping the chandelier he&#39;s standing on!</p>
<p>The Shy Guy, Chandeli-ho, hurt by Boomer&#39;s sword, drops it!</p>
<p>Boomer falls...</p>
<p><strong>Chandeli-ho:</strong> &quot;Boomer! Oh, poor Boomer! But not to worry! A little fall isn&#39;t going to hurt you!&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/YOcDhyhZO5g?t=21s">So, Boomer will live?</a></p>
<p>The Chandeli-ho on our end congratulates us, and gives us a hand up to the roof!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/q64JKhR.png alt="boost to the roof" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Here we go!</p>
<p>Everyone&#39;s dancing and jumping to <a href=https://youtu.be/ITLpdASZO5M>Midas River music</a> as the Chandeli-ho pulls his chandelier up to the top floor of the castle!</p>
<p>He warns us to buckle up, but that was just an expression!</p>
<p>We jump up to the top!</p>
<p>And the battle is over as Peach gains a level!</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Now we face the giant sword, <strong>Exor</strong>, whose Eye is protecting him!</p>
<p><strong>Wait a minute, so this</strong> <strong><em>isn&#39;t</em></strong> <strong>Smithy after all?</strong></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/u8e1xzx.png alt=exor width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I start the battle by having Geno boost Mario&#39;s stats!</p>
<p>Now we have multiple targets...a bit strange that Exor&#39;s mouth is called <strong>Neosquid</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>ETA:</strong> The remake finally retranslates this as a <strong>Mouth</strong>.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/FomjXzG.png alt="neosquid what?" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>So Exor&#39;s actual face is at the pommel of the sword...</p>
<p>The mouth and right eye can cast spells, huh?</p>
<p>I have Mario and Geno attack both the eyes!</p>
<p>The mouth casts a new spell, <strong>Corona</strong>, on our party!</p>
<p>After the left eye&#39;s KO&#39;d, Exor is no longer protected!</p>
<p>I have Mario attack Exor now!</p>
<p>The right eye comes to, and the mouth sings Geno to sleep!</p>
<p>Now the mouth&#39;s out for now...</p>
<p>I KO Exor&#39;s left eye, and direct all attacks to Exor the pommel.</p>
<p>The right eye unleashes a <strong>Dark Star</strong>, a large, angry star who pounces on one of our party members thrice!</p>
<p>I continue the attack on the pommel...</p>
<p>The left eye poisons us, and the right eye unleashes an Aurora Flash!</p>
<p>I have Geno use up a Geno Flash, and heal everyone with a Megalixir!</p>
<p>So the left eye delivers status effects...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/0iXgeUy.png alt="exor down" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Exor&#39;s down!</strong></p>
<p>Now what is he doing?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/GG4kiCC.png alt="exor portal" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Where is Exor taking everyone!?</strong></p>
<p><a name=6></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We&#39;re now in a...place of sorts.</p>
<p>Geno points out that we&#39;re now in a portal between the two worlds: the world of Smithy, and the Mushroom Kingdom, with Exor as the portal gate.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/VzOWXVq.png alt="void bw worlds" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Geno:</strong> &quot;If we follow this road, we&#39;ll find Smithy. So...what&#39;s keeping us?&quot;</p>
<p>Bowser butts in, saying that he only came along to reclaim his castle, not interested to finish the job. He also tells Mario that Mario&#39;s fixing his castle, as per his duty as a &quot;Koopa Troop member&quot;...</p>
<p>Geno laughs for the first time!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/gFkf1lM.png alt="geno laughs" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Geno points out that Exor is the &quot;contact point&quot; again, and even if Exor is defeated, more of Smithy&#39;s troops will come through the portal!</p>
<p>Bowser&#39;s now worried about what would happen to his castle now...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/LKDTS1j.png alt="bowser worries" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Bowser:</strong> &quot;What about my...<strong><em>PRIVACY?</em></strong>&quot; </p>
<p><strong>Lol!</strong></p>
<p>He doesn&#39;t like the idea of interdimensional beings who look like weapons roosting on his keep, and weeps...he even says &quot;that stinks!&quot;</p>
<p>He even worries more about his reputation as well...lol...</p>
<p>Bowser now makes up a story, falsely swearing revenge at the Smithy forces who messed with his Troop! Lol...oh Bowser...</p>
<p>There&#39;s a bouncepad at the corner, just in case we need to backtrack a bit...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/lPrM4WL.png alt="map now" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I head back to Mario&#39;s Pad and save my progress there.</p>

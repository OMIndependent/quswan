<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>I now make my whole way through Land&#39;s End to get back to the temple...</p>
<p>On the way, I figure out how to maneuver the cannons to fire where I want Mario to go to!</p>
<p>In one battle, I have Geno use a Geno Blast to take care of a troop of enemies, leaving a Shy Away. But the Shy Away shies away instead of fighting back...</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the hooded shopkeeper isn&#39;t there to give me a lift up to the cliff!</p>
<p>I also pick up a <strong>Power Blast</strong> from Stingers and an Octovader, which increases the entire party&#39;s attack power!</p>
<p>I keep missing the Shogun in the sand whirlpools! This time, he knows us (?) and lets us sink into the whirlpools without a battle!</p>
<p>But, I have to fight the Geckits in the caves...</p>
<p>I now arrive inside Belome&#39;s Temple.</p>
<p>What more surprises are in store here?</p>
<p>I take the chest block, which has 50 coins inside!</p>
<p>The shopkeeper&#39;s also there, below the Belome head statues! He asks if I want my fortune told for 50 coins...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/nAhyK4Q.png alt="50 coins fortune" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The worst thing this shopkeeper could do is summon or turn into a monster, so I accept the offer.</p>
<p>He points to the three Belome heads mounted on the wall.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/NIl6MLm.png alt="belome heads" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Afterwards, he vanishes, leaving us with the Belome heads...</p>
<p>Middle, left, and right is the order I have Mario hit it in, and down comes a stack of bricks with our fortune!</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the fortune: &quot;<strong>If you proceed in the pipe next door...you&#39;ll have many friends in the future.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>I have Mario jump on the brick stack, jump up to the top, and head into the next chamber, where a green pipe awaits!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Going down the pipe, our &quot;friends&quot; are Chows!</p>
<p>I take on one in battle, where he has friends as well: two Shoguns and a Fink Flower!</p>
<p>The Fink Flower could also recover health too, huh? Luckily the enemy&#39;s low on physical defense.</p>
<p>It seems I have to take care of all of the Chows here before proceeding through the gate...</p>
<p>After the battle with the last Chow, Mario levels up! I boost his physical stats.</p>
<p>The door forward opens and a bounce pad backwards drops down!</p>
<p>I cross forward.</p>
<p>In the next room, I pick up another 150 coins from a chest block!</p>
<p>But after reading through a map of the temple, I jump on top of the chest, and get a hidden chest block containing a Frog Coin!</p>
<p>And another hidden chest block with a Frog Coin!</p>
<p>And the visible chest block with a Frog Coin is also ours!</p>
<p>We meet the shopkeeper again.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/c7lGLys.png alt="shopkeeper fortune" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Shopkeeper:</strong> &quot;If you&#39;re lucky, you&#39;ll run into Belome, and Monstro Town will be just beyond him.&quot;</p>
<p>Wait, Belome&#39;s still alive!?</p>
<p>I have Mario hit the Belome head on the wall near the shopkeeper, which puts out a scroll, reading:</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/cFAGgqM.png alt="not accepting bedtime" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Sorry, I&#39;m not accepting visitors past my bedtime.</strong>&quot; (I wrote the message just in case the screencap above does not show up.)</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We take the yellow platform down and into...</p>
<p>...a room with Flowers, Frog Coins, and plenty of items!</p>
<p>But, a golden Belome blocks the way!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/7iWOVNE.png alt="belome need key" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We don&#39;t have a key, so we turn back...</p>
<p>I talk to the shopkeeper, who says the same thing, hit the Belome head statue, and go back to the treasure room again...</p>
<p>After the second try, I head back and hit the Belome bust, which now puts out a fortune that has something different to say:</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/etRuiSl.png alt="sooo hungry" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Mmm, I&#39;m so hungry! Wish I had something to eat!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>I have Mario head back down to the yellow platform!</p>
<p>Instead of the treasure room, we now arrive at a room with a green pipe!</p>
<p>I have Mario sink into the pipe...</p>
<p>...where we now meet up with Belome!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/7Aamp7Z.png alt="belome alive" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I recover our Flower Points before facing his ravenous, four-eyed mass!</p>
<p>The doors behind him are lowered shut...</p>
<p>Looks like I have to face him!</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>

<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/QjVAPoH.png alt="belome battle" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Belome:</strong> &quot;I never forget a taste! In fact, I can clone someone after just one slurp. Watch!&quot;</p>
<p>He jumps in front of Mallow!</p>
<p><strong>Belome:</strong> &quot;You all LOOK delicious! But, how do you TASTE?&quot;</p>
<p>*<em>gulp</em>*...</p>
<p>He eats Mallow!</p>
<p><strong>Belome:</strong> &quot;YES! THIS is YUMMY~ There we are!&quot;</p>
<p>He spits out Mallow, and makes a clone out of Mallow!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/zibyF0e.png alt="belome and clone mallow" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Oh dear, how do we fight him now?</p>
<p>We take care of the Mallow clone in one turn!</p>
<p>He goes after Mario next. Mario tastes sour to him...</p>
<p>I have one go after Belome, while the rest of the party takes care of the clones...</p>
<p>After taking care of the second Mallow clone, Belome uses <strong>Aurora Flash</strong>, which makes Geno sleep!</p>
<p>So far, he hasn&#39;t eaten Geno yet...</p>
<p><strong>Belome:</strong> &quot;Oh no, not again! I&#39;m STARVING! Time to go home for dinner. Goodbye, boys and girls!&quot;</p>
<p>And with that, Belome is taken care of!</p>
<p>Now it&#39;s the lone Mario clone that&#39;s left...and that&#39;s it!</p>
<p>Mallow levels up, magical stats up!</p>
<p>With Belome finished, a green switch pad appears!</p>
<p>The door now opens, and our friendly Rat Funk is there, who tells us the pipe ahead leads to <strong>Monstro Town</strong>!</p>
<p>Honestly, who or what <strong>is</strong> Belome?</p>

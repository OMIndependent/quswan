<p>Now at Rose Way, I read the nearby sign before the base of the river, which says that I can&#39;t jump on or off when yellow blocks turn blue.</p>
<p>I jump to the nearest yellow block, which turns blue, and whizzes me to another block, which I have it stop at an island where a mushroom sits...</p>
<p>I get the remaining items in the lake...</p>
<p>...while newer creatures come after us: an <strong>Arachne</strong> and a <strong>Starslap!</strong></p>
<p>Mallow&#39;s new <strong>Froggie Stick</strong> gives him better attack!</p>
<p>I let the yellow platform turn blue, which hovers to two exits in the area...</p>
<p>I take the northwest one...</p>
<p>There&#39;s a treasure block high up, and two swinging platforms with <strong>Shy Guys</strong> on them!</p>
<p>There&#39;s two Shy Guys and a Snapdragon I have to face...</p>
<p>The Shy Guy silenced Mario with a Doom Reverb...</p>
<p>The Shy Guy&#39;s got a range of special attacks, and he&#39;s hard to mind read!</p>
<p>Mario gains another level, and I boost his health further!</p>
<p>I&#39;m running out of Mushrooms here too...</p>
<p>I jump on one of the swinging platforms and wait until the second one&#39;s within reach to face off against the next set of Shy Guy forces...</p>
<p>Mallow also levels up, and I increase Mallow&#39;s defense and attack!</p>
<p>After a few attempts, I manage to get another Frog Coin from the chest!</p>
<p>I go back, trying to get the floating coins, no chance.</p>

<hr>
<p>There are some robber enemies I run into that lunge at me and then run away...are they like Metal Slimes in that if you defeat them you get tons of gold?</p>
<p>I head forward into the next area, the same lake where the yellow-to-blue platforms are.</p>
<p>After getting the coins there, it&#39;s off to the southwest area, where a Shy Guy&#39;s sitting on top of a chest block!</p>
<p>The Arachne, when I had Mallow scan him, is singing Day-O in his head...</p>
<p>There&#39;s a lot of Shy Guys on treasure chests in this area!</p>
<p>So the robber enemy&#39;s name is a <strong>Crook</strong>...</p>
<p>In one battle where he doesn&#39;t run, I finish off the Crook quickly.</p>
<p>Oh no, the Arachne&#39;s pulling out its Venom Drool!</p>
<p>A few more battles and chest blocks of coins later, I see Goombas in single file in the next area...that&#39;s strange...</p>
<p>Once we get there, Mario pulls Mallow to hide...</p>

<p>Looks like Bowser&#39;s alive. Now he&#39;s ordering his troops: the Magikoopas, the Terrapins, and the Goombas to attention!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/op3Yqal.png alt="bowser bridge" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Bowser and his troops march away, planning to take back Bowser&#39;s castle...</p>
<p>Mallow tells us that Rose Town is up ahead.</p>

<p>Heading west of where we fought Cloaker, we&#39;re now in Smithy&#39;s factory!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Mtaw0Qp.png alt="smithy factory line" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>It looks like one of those cold, high-tech factories.</p>
<p>There&#39;s now a clerk overseeing the newly made minions, with hammer workers in tow!</p>
<p>So they&#39;re planning to build a new army, huh?</p>
<p>Mallow&#39;s in shock and anger!</p>
<p>Mallow proudly introduces Mario to the Clerk, and makes an ultimatum to them.</p>
<p><strong>Mallow:</strong> &quot;Shut down production now or he&#39;ll...<strong>stomp</strong> ya!&quot;</p>
<p>The clerk doesn&#39;t like that, not one bit, and the <strong>Mad Mallet</strong> security hammer forces come in...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/yOfy8dF.png alt=mallets width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>But we&#39;re too strong for them, as the last one runs away in fright!</p>
<p>Now the <strong>Clerk</strong> joins in the fray!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/t0zyXQg.png alt="clerk boss" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Yikes, the Clerk is a machine!</p>
<p>Let&#39;s see what happens now that his Mallet minions are gone...</p>
<p>He invigorates himself, but he&#39;s finished off immediately!</p>
<p><strong>Mallow:</strong> &quot;Ha! Hope you learned your lesson!&quot;</p>
<p>Mallow&#39;s optimistic about the end in sight...as we move forward, Mallow gets a &quot;what does this button do&quot; moment.</p>
<p>But nothing happens...until something does! Oh god no!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/MWZzBTv.png alt="claw pulls mallow" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Mallow, completely unaware at Mario&#39;s reaction, thinks Mario&#39;s pranking him! No prank.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/6qkYOfY.png alt="the claw" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>He gets pulled by the claw! Lucky Mario pushes him out of there!</p>
<p>We proceed forward, but then...</p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;<strong>Mario!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Oh my god, <strong><em>Toad!?</em></strong></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Boq2QlG.png alt="toad omg" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Toad:</strong> &quot;Phew, I...finally made it up here...let me help you guys out!&quot;</p>
<p>The Princess appears and Toad jumps in fright! Peach apologizes to Toad for sneaking out of the Kingdom, saying that she wanted to help Mario on his quest.</p>
<p><strong>Toad:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s it! Any job that lets me help both Mario and the Princess is worthwhile!&quot;</p>
<p>Peach is puzzled by Toad&#39;s willingness to help.</p>
<p>Looks like Toad&#39;s setting up shop for us!</p>
<p>I get everything I can at this point, especially Pick Me Ups, and more syrup...</p>
<p>Toad also offers us Rock Candy, which we sold already. I take out a Rock Candy in our inventory in place of another Rock Candy...oh my god...</p>
<p>The Princess thanks Toad for his help.</p>
<p>I&#39;m just a bit surprised that Toad came all this way to the end...</p>
<p>I head forward. What&#39;s beyond in this factory?</p>
<p>Another set of supervisors await!</p>
<p>One of the Pounders mentions a Drill Bit coming on time, and that they&#39;re ahead of schedule in building the army.</p>
<p>So it&#39;s the <strong>Manager</strong> we have to face next!</p>
<p>The Manager&#39;s an ambitious one, isn&#39;t he?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/lX5dWlQ.png alt="manager ambitious" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>But Bowser&#39;s laugh rings through the air and says that <strong>he</strong> rules that world!</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The Manager&#39;s shocked that the Mack and Yaridovich clones didn&#39;t stop us!</p>
<p>Bowser&#39;s now wanting a piece of the Manager.</p>
<p>The Manager makes one of the most unforgettable threats...to Mario.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/enyCq7S.png alt=threat width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Bowser&#39;s not happy he&#39;s getting ignored! Hee...</p>
<p>The next fight begins!</p>
<p>The <strong>Pounder</strong>s are pushovers, but the Manager&#39;s a mini-bomb lobber!</p>
<p>I have everyone focus their attacks on the Manager...</p>
<p>But the Pounders, motivated to please Smithy, fight back without the Manager!</p>
<p>After the dust settles, Bowser&#39;s still taken aback by the Manager ignoring him...</p>
<p>He even recites a haiku...heh...poor Bowser...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/vbpwayb.png alt=haiku width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Mario pats him on the shell...awwww, Mario....</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/62DCwJ8.png alt="shell pat" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We move forward to the next line, where Peach faces off against the <strong>Director</strong>, telling him to stop production.</p>
<p>The Director refuses.</p>
<p><strong>Director:</strong> &quot;Any dissent against Smithy will be dealt with by immediate melt down.&quot; <img class=emojione alt=â˜¹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Peach is in shock! She runs back to Mario! Poor Peach...</p>
<p><strong>Director:</strong> &quot;Dissenters will be eliminated. Production will continue.&quot;</p>
<p>Now we face off again, and the Director&#39;s a strong foe!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Qf00oOT.png alt="director boss" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The <strong>Poundette</strong>s are also no joke!</p>
<p>Lucky Geno gets two chances to attack! No, three chances! No, four! But I accidentally have him target the Director, ending his attack chain!</p>
<p>The Director&#39;s now alone, empowering himself!</p>
<p>We do the same!</p>
<p>More Poundettes come back to help their boss!</p>
<p>Knowing how much of a threat he is now, we focus attacks on the Director!</p>
<p>Now the Director unleashes a spritz of mini bombs, KO&#39;ing Peach!</p>
<p>After reviving Peach, we eventually gain the upper hand, where I have Geno boost her defenses as the first move...</p>
<p>The Director&#39;s now finished, along with the Poundettes!</p>
<p><strong>Peach:</strong> &quot;That was scary! But we can&#39;t run away now. We&#39;ve got to kick these lowlifes out of our world.&quot; Nod from Mario there.</p>
<p>Finally, a save block!</p>
<p>I&#39;m betting that Smithy&#39;s in the hall just ahead...</p>

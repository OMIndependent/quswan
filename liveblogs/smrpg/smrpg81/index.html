<p>I just realized after reading a few guides online that I could have finished Exor off with one <strong>Geno Whirl!</strong> Aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!!!!!</p>
<p>For anyone who&#39;s still around reading these, thank you for staying till the end, and for <strong>not</strong> spoiling me about that part, or any others!</p>
<p>I also remembered that I asked this question at the start of the game:</p>
<p><em>I wonder, is [Exor] the sword itself the Smithy Gang, or is the sword like a gatekeeper or messenger of the actual Smithy Gang?</em></p>
<p>It turns out my second guess was sort of right! Exor&#39;s literally both a gate for Smithy&#39;s troops to enter the Mushroom Kingdom, and a gatekeeper to Smithy&#39;s dimension!</p>
<p>Now back to the action...</p>
<p>Left, left, straight, right is the way to get to those secret treasures in the Forest Maze...</p>
<p>I also pick up some treasures from Surprise Blocks along the way...</p>
<p>In the middle of my Surprise Block search, I fight more battles, involving Buzzers and an Amanita...</p>
<p>After saving, we now go into the actual maze!</p>
<p>Hmmm, this isn&#39;t right...I&#39;m not going in the right direction...</p>
<p>I check a map of the maze to check my bearings...</p>
<p>...after trying again, I make it!</p>

<p>Now I have Mario sink into the log to see what&#39;s there...</p>
<p>Treasures galore!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/6zdHRc3.png alt="treasures galore" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I use up a syrup and toss out a few items before getting the loot!</p>
<p>One Frog Coin, three Mushrooms, and a Flower are what we get!</p>
<p>I head back...</p>
<p>On the way back, I get another Frog Coin from a Surprise Block, and a KeroKero Cola from another!</p>
<p>I save at Nimbus Land, since I&#39;m heading to Barrel Volcano next...</p>

<p><a href=https://www.mariouniverse.com/wp-content/img/maps/snes/smrpg/nl-barrelvolcano.png>I search a map online for the Barrel Volcano</a>, and look through it. The only things that I missed here are Frog Coins...</p>
<p>And I use up one of the KeroKero Colas here...</p>
<p>While a bunch of Pyrospheres chase me, I get the Frog Coin from the lava! Poor Mario, though...</p>
<p>For the next area, I make it to the other side, head into the tunnel, and go back to use the lava to bounce Mario up to the ledge where the next Frog Coin is!</p>
<p>I save at the midpoint and continue onwards.</p>
<p>After countless battles in the volcano, I rest at Hinopio&#39;s and exit out!</p>
<p>On the way out, Mario, Bowser, and Mallow level up!</p>
<p>My god, there&#39;s a lot of steps to jump up to!</p>
<p>Next stop: Monstro Town!</p>

<p></p><h2 class=entry-title>Super Mario RPG - Part 81a: Culex, Take Two</h2><p></p>

<p>Let&#39;s see if I have the strength to face Culex once more, or at least, survive him longer!</p>
<p>The game doesn&#39;t recognize that I didn&#39;t take on Culex last time, and the intro with <strong>Culex, Dark Knight of Vanda</strong>, begins again...</p>
<p><strong>Culex:</strong> &quot;<strong>You will enter combat against me?</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><strong>I do.</strong></p>
<p>Culex repeats his monologue, <a href=https://youtu.be/12rOdMEDP4o>and round two with Culex is on!</a></p>
<p>I have the party strike the Fire Crystal first!</p>
<p>But, the crystals are a bit too quick and too strong for us!</p>
<p>They&#39;re even a bit too much for Bowser, as he&#39;s KO&#39;d!</p>
<p>Culex unleashes Shredder, I&#39;m thinking that this spell dispels our bonus buffs!</p>
<p>I have Mario resurrect Bowser!</p>
<p>I have Peach heal the party.</p>
<p>Now both Mario and Bowser are down!</p>
<p>And after using up one turn reviving Mario, the party&#39;s finished!</p>

<p></p><h2 class=entry-title>Super Mario RPG - Part 81b: Jinx, Take One</h2><p></p>

<p>I decide to face off against <strong>Jinx</strong> in his dojo.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/HV1hfr8.png alt="you wish to challenge" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Yes, I do!</p>
<p><strong>Jinx:</strong> &quot;All right, let&#39;s see what you&#39;re capable of.&quot;</p>
<p>Now the fight begins against Jinx!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/C9m2wnr.png alt="jinx boss" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Jinx does a <strong>Triple Kick</strong>, bowling Mario back!</p>
<p>I use all of the party&#39;s brute force against Jinx! He&#39;s amazed at our skill!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/MewiAMG.png alt=AMAZING! width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The battle ends!</p>
<p><strong>Jinx:</strong> &quot;I guess I underestimated you. You pack quite a punch! But don&#39;t let it go to your head, because I let you have that round. Let&#39;s have a rematch.&quot;</p>
<p>Knowing that Jinx is holding back, I challenge him for the second time, but just this once...</p>
<p>The second round against Jinx begins!</p>
<p>Jinx Triple Kicks and Quicksilvers Bowser!</p>
<p>Jinx has gotten a bit stronger than in the first round...</p>
<p>I keep my guard up this time!</p>
<p>Now Jinx Valors Up!</p>
<p>Jinx&#39;s next attack is Jinxing Peach with a flurry of combos!</p>
<p>After one more attack from Mario, Jinx praises us once more, stopping the fight!</p>
<p><strong>Jinx:</strong> &quot;Still haven&#39;t had enough? It isn&#39;t often that I have someone this competitive to spar with! All right, this match will be the one that counts, since I&#39;m putting my reputation on the line!&quot;</p>
<p>I leave Jinx&#39;s dojo, and save outside.</p>
<p>If I&#39;m not strong enough to beat Culex yet, then I feel that I&#39;m not ready for Jinx&#39;s third (and I&#39;m guessing, final) round!</p>

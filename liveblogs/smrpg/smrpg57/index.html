<p>All right, into the wild Land&#39;s End I go!</p>
<p>This time, I have the old trio as my active party: Mario, Mallow, and Geno.</p>
<p>At the entrance is a save block which I use immediately!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/JLe4hUe.png alt=cannon width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>There is also a cannon on a small plateau, and it can take me anywhere depending on its position...</p>
<p>I aim it at the yellow platform!</p>
<p>But, I fall down trying to get to the other side...</p>
<p>This place should be called Cannon Land, or Cannon Cliffs, for the alliteration.</p>
<p>The second cannon, however, doesn&#39;t have enough force to push us to the top of the cliff...</p>
<p>But, on the second try, with some leaping power from Mario, we land bullseye at a pit! Large mice monsters, or <strong>Chows</strong>, come out from the pit!</p>
<p>I face a <strong>Chow</strong>, and an <strong>Octovader</strong>...</p>
<p>My god, Geno&#39;s Rocket Punch looks pretty powerful!</p>
<p>The next troops to face us are a Chow and a <strong>Shogun</strong>!</p>
<p>The Chow poisons Geno!</p>
<p>The Shogun performs a <strong>Carni-kiss</strong>, which does heavy damage!</p>
<p>Chow howls at Geno, but it has no effect, because it&#39;s Geno!</p>
<p>Into the next area, where there are moving cannons (their heads keep moving and launching) and tons of orange geckos, or <strong>Geckits</strong>, along with large tarantula creatures, or <strong>Spinthras</strong>!</p>
<p>Spinthras are also poisoners like Chows too...and they deal heavy damage! Lucky Mario&#39;s wearing a ring that prevents him from getting poisoned!</p>
<p>The Geckit&#39;s an easily confused monster...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>While trying to get up to the cliff, I step on one of the moving cannons, which caused the earlier encounter with the Geckit, pushing Mario to the cliff, and knocking him out!</p>
<p>Land&#39;s End is a really tough place...</p>
<p>So the moving cannons are the ones firing the Geckits! Or rather, the Geckits leap onto the cannons and the cannons launch them to the cliffs!</p>
<p>I go back to the first cannon, the still one, and launch Mario at the cliff! But, I accidentally aim the cannon at the edge of the mountain!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/n29NXpR.png alt="mario no land" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Like in those old cartoons, it takes a while for Mario to realize he&#39;s not on standing on anything!</p>
<p>He dashes back to the cannon instead of falling, though!</p>
<p>So I lean left on my control pad to push Mario back up to the cliff!</p>
<p>After three more battles with Geckits, and more monsters such as <strong>Chewys</strong> (Piranha Plants), and a <strong>Shy Away</strong> (a Shy Guy with wings), I make it!</p>
<p>It&#39;s also one of the first times I use <strong>Geno Boost</strong>, which boosts the target&#39;s attack!</p>
<p>Mario also makes it to level 14! And he learns another new move!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/FcBg92V.png alt="ultra jump" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Mallow also levels up, and learns a new move too: <strong>Snowy</strong>!</p>
<p>I increase both their physical attack and defense power!</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>In the next area now, and it&#39;s no longer rocky anymore!</p>
<p>I save at the next block nearby and jump on the spinning pink flower...</p>
<p>...but not before getting into another battle (aaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!! More battles!!!) with a <strong>Stinger</strong> and a <strong>Fink Flower</strong>!</p>
<p>I walk over to the next area, where there are two tall cliffs, and high platforms connecting them. There&#39;s also that hooded shopkeeper on top of the east cliff!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/aU7D4iA.png alt="tall cliff" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I turn back, trying to avoid the Stingers on the climb up.</p>
<p>I get into another battle, and use Mallow&#39;s <strong>Snowy</strong> spell for the first time! The attack blows a big blizzard, and forms a big snowman that hits all enemies!</p>
<p>After the battle, Bowser gains a level! I boost his physical stats!</p>
<p>I now make it down to where the shopkeeper is. He mentions the platforms are the Sky Bridge. I have Mario shake his head no when he offers a &quot;challenge&quot; on the Bridge...</p>
<p>I change my mind and have Mario accept the challenge.</p>
<p>I can choose to cross the Sky Bridge by one out of three courses, according to the shopkeeper, but if I fall, it&#39;s over!</p>
<p>There&#39;s a <strong>Normal</strong> and a <strong>Special</strong> course, where the second one has a time limit!</p>
<p>Each course has their own prize. The Normal one wins us 5 coins, while the Special has 8 coins.</p>
<p>The <strong>Expert</strong> course has a different path, but with the added challenges of the Special! But, we get a Frog Coin as a reward if we ace that one.</p>
<p>So our object is to make it to the other side while avoiding Bullet Bills...</p>
<p>I take the Normal course for practice, and for curiosity&#39;s sake.</p>
<p>With ease, I make it to the other side, where the shopkeeper gives me the option of doubling my winnings, but with a harder course!</p>
<p>I have Mario refuse and win back the five coins I paid to take up the course!</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>In the next area, I land down on sand dunes, where a Rat Funk, a friendly one, asks us if we&#39;re headed to Monstro Town.</p>
<p>That&#39;s probably the town with the reformed enemies that the Elder back at Seaside was talking about.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/fLBIjBc.png alt="rat funk friend" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I have Mario say yes.</p>
<p>He gives us advice on how to get there...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/HjOaEVZ.png alt="ant sand whirlpool" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>So all we have to do is to get into a sand whirpool where an ant is, and follow it down, which will take us underground, take a corner, and Monstro Town&#39;s there!</p>
<p>The Rat Funk leaves...</p>
<p>After saving, I head out to find that ant...</p>
<p>I get into one of the quicksand whirlpools, and get into a battle with Shoguns! They&#39;re weak against ice spells, or in this case, Mallow&#39;s Snowy spell!</p>
<p>I have Mario fall immediately into one of the sand whirlpools...which take us to an area we&#39;ve went to before...</p>
<p>After fighting another set of Shoguns and sinking on their whirlpool, we&#39;re at another different area this time!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/aoeoEmA.png alt="blue wisp" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>There&#39;s some sort of blue wisp flying above Mario...I have Mario chase after the blue wisp, but it&#39;s too fast and too high!</p>
<p>Trucking onward...</p>
<p>On the way, Geno levels up, and learns another move: <strong>Geno Blast!</strong></p>
<p>Peach levels up too!</p>
<p>I increase their maximum health!</p>
<p>After falling into the third whirlpool, and turning at a corner, we now stand before a very high cliff, where our Rat Funk friend is! The cliff&#39;s too high for him to climb, so he heads off to Monstro Town...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/mNSpxF2.png alt="climb here" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I have Mario take the climb up!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Mario can&#39;t get a grip on the cliff&#39;s walls, so I head back to the sands, finding Monstro Town...</p>
<p>I use Geno Blast for the first time! It&#39;s an array of beams hitting all enemies!</p>
<p>After that battle, I sink into the whirlpool, where I&#39;m now underground!</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I save before hitting the chest block in the cavern below, which contains a Star!</p>
<p>I manage to clear out one area of monsters before the Star&#39;s power fades...</p>
<p>Avoiding the stack of Chows, I have Mario go around them, and jump down into the hole below...</p>
<p>...where I land near a den of Geckits!</p>
<p>Jumping past a stack of crates west, a shopkeeper offers a Star for 400 coints! That&#39;s too much! He vanishes...</p>
<p>With careful jumps and cautious steps, I cross into the tunnel...</p>
<p>...leading to a golden-bricked temple, belonging to Belome!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/zIH8x3J.png alt="belome entrance" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The shopkeeper&#39;s there, on a bounce pad, and asks for 100 coins if we want to get back to the surface...</p>
<p>I think long and hard before making this decision...I say yes.</p>
<p>I have Mario jump on the bouncepad, and we&#39;re now back at the surface...I use the whirlpools to head back...</p>
<p>After reading the map for this area, it seems like I&#39;ve missed a lot of treasures here!</p>
<p>I save at the entrance of the dunes, and bounce back up to Sky Bridge!</p>
<p>I fall down to the bottom!</p>
<p>Thank goodness another hooded shopkeeper offers us a lift up to the cliff! I have Mario refuse and head back an area.</p>
<p><a name=6></a></p>
<hr>
<p>As I try to get some hidden treasures, I get into another battle, where a Stinger uses a <strong>Funguspike</strong>, turning Geno into a mushroom!</p>
<p>The benefit of being turned into a mushroom is that he recovers health!</p>
<p>I manage to find a Frog Coin in a hidden chest block, but I land myself into another battle!</p>
<p>Mario and Mallow level up, where I boost their magical stats!</p>
<p>Now to get back to finding those hidden items...</p>
<p>I also learn that when alone, Octovader can attack twice!</p>
<p>There&#39;s that wisp again!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/bEvE7q2.png alt="blue wisp 2" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>But since there&#39;s no way to chase it, I go back to chest block hunting! There&#39;s supposed to be one hidden chest block in the starting area of Land&#39;s End...</p>
<p>I manage to get the chest block: a <strong>Red Essence</strong>, which keeps the target invincible for 3 turns in battle!</p>
<p>I toss out a Sleepy Bomb before saving here and moving on to other parts in Land&#39;s End...</p>

<p></p><h2 class=entry-title>Super Mario RPG - Part 57a: Mokura</h2><p></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I managed to get to this battle in between parts 6 and 7 of my Land&#39;s End walkthrough.</p>
<p>With some luck and height, I touch the quick small blue wisp, which takes me to a battle with a monster that&#39;s...invisible, though it&#39;s there: a <strong>Formless</strong>!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/96Gip9Y.png alt=formless width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Using Mario&#39;s Super Flame, we hit it!</p>
<p>The Formless then laughs:</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/mzVhm35.png alt="mokura huh huh" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>It reveals itself to be a <a href=https://www.mariowiki.com/Mokura><strong>Mokura</strong></a>, a green cloud with a very creepy, unsettling grin...</p>
<p>It&#39;s vulnerable to physical attacks while in this form, but very resistant to spells and special attacks...</p>
<p>We get more XP (but no coins), and Bowser levels up to 15, and he learns a new move: <strong>Crusher</strong>!! I boost his magical stats...</p>
<p><a name=7></a></p>

<p></p><h2 class=entry-title>Super Mario RPG - Part 57: Land&#39;s End (continued)</h2><p></p>

<p>I continue searching for more hidden chests now...</p>
<p>On the way, I get a <strong>Bracer</strong>, which increases defense in battle on one target!</p>
<p>I end up jumping up into a steaming pit situated on the left cliff of the Sky Bridge...</p>
<p>...and warp into an underground cave!</p>
<p>I get into another battle with a Geckit, and Spinthra, along with a <strong>Kriffid</strong>, a brown version of an Artichoker!</p>
<p>The Kriffid doesn&#39;t like ice, but it has a solid defense!</p>
<p>Geno and Peach level up again! I boost Geno&#39;s health!</p>
<p>Peach also learns another spell: <strong>Mute</strong>! I boost her magical stats!</p>
<p>I jump on a stack of crates to reach the high chest block: another Frog Coin&#39;s in there!</p>
<p>Avoiding the monsters here, I manage to find another hidden chest block with another Frog Coin inside!</p>
<p>In the next area, I knock over a barrel...</p>
<p>Falling down to a lower part of the cavern, I hit another chest block, which has a mushroom...</p>
<p>...and a bounce pad taking us back into Kero Sewers!</p>
<p>Now I can reach that chest block that I couldn&#39;t get the last time I was here!</p>
<p>The chest block contains...a <strong>Cricket Jam</strong>!</p>
<p>After a long cut through Midas River, I make it back to Land&#39;s End and save here...</p>
<p>Oh my god, this was <strong>another</strong> long session to playthrough, and a chore to write down!</p>

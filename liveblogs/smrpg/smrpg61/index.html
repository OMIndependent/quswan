<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>I&#39;ll probably fight Culex again after I get all seven Star Pieces.</p>
<p>I buy some more stuff in the Goomba&#39;s Weapon &amp; Armor Shop before meeting the Toad in the first house.</p>
<p>For Bowser, he gets a new weapon and armor: a <strong>Spiked Link</strong>, and a <strong>Courage Shell</strong>.</p>
<p>Before meeting the Toad, I play around with the fan monster on the end of the room. I switch it to &#39;Blast&#39;, and he turns red!</p>
<p>The Toad, <strong>Monstermama</strong>, is surprised to see visitors like us! She&#39;s the landlady of Monstro Town.</p>
<p>Mario pantomimes his &quot;star get&quot; post and makes the Star Piece sound effect to tell her what he wants!</p>
<p>Monstermama thinks that Mario&#39;s there to see &quot;their&quot; Star, who&#39;s upstairs...</p>
<p>I have Mario look upstairs to find her.</p>
<p>That is definitely a Star, but not a Star Piece...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/VtEu3zY.png alt="star but not the star we're looking for" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I have Mario interact with her. She dances on the table...</p>
<p>I talk to the Pandorite next, who tells me about hidden chests, which &quot;pop out of thin air,&quot; he says, if I jump at the right place.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/IN1ZSnn.png alt="surprise box explain" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>So these hidden chest blocks have a name: <strong>Surprise Boxes</strong>. Luckily, we ran into some!</p>
<p>He points out there are still <strong>29</strong> more we need to look for.</p>
<p>I talk to the Rat Funk, who mentions the elderly Gardener from Rose Town that we met earlier.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We head back down to meet Monstermama, who asks us if we think their &quot;Star&quot;&#39;s adorable. She also points out that the Star&#39;s talented too!</p>
<p>Mario shakes his head no. That&#39;s not what we&#39;re looking for...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/0zeP6r9.png alt="oh starbees" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Monstermama:</strong> &quot;Oh, Star Piece! Nope, not familiar with &#39;em. So, you came all the way to search for a Star Piece? It must be <strong>really</strong> important. This is the last place on land. If you can&#39;t find it here...the only place left, is <strong>UP!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Mario&#39;s in shock at the idea! He accepts, and wants to go up!</p>
<p>Monstermama mentions a secret passage to the sky at <strong>Bean Valley</strong>. But we have to climb the cliff we saw earlier at Land&#39;s End.</p>
<p>Monstermama then calls for help:</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/cVxVYL4.png alt="sky troopas" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>They&#39;re not coming...then they come!</p>
<p>The Sky Troopas are summoned!</p>
<p>It took them 8.52 seconds to get into Monstermama&#39;s house!</p>
<p>Sgt. Flutter is their leader!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/EDV6035.png alt="sgt flutter late" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Sgt. Flutter points out the Troopas are 0.52 seconds late. So the Sky Troopas come in 8 seconds exactly after they&#39;re called...</p>
<p>Monstermama points out Sgt. Flutter&#39;s adherence with the rules, and tells him to let that go in front of her. She tells them about us getting to Bean Valley.</p>
<p>They have their orders: &quot;Get Mustache over the cliff.&quot;</p>
<p>They liftoff and leave the house to tell the other troops!</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I go into the next door, where a Chow, a Thwomp, and a Piranha Plant live...</p>
<p>The Piranha Plant mentions the guy next door, mentioning &quot;Crystal-this and an Evil-that.&quot; The Crystal, the Piranha Plant points out, is a &quot;shiny rock..&quot;</p>
<p>I have Mario talk to Thwomp next who jumps and stomps the floor! He mentions Mario being a legendary jumper! I have Mario follow his lead and talk to him again, who says that Mario&#39;s &quot;out-pumped!&quot;</p>
<p>Looks like this is going to be a casual competition...</p>
<p>The Chow records Mario&#39;s Super Jumps, which are only at <strong>1</strong>...</p>
<p>The Chow promises to give us a prize if we do <strong>30</strong> Super Jumps in a row in battle!</p>
<p>If I talk to the Thwomp again, the key above the perch&#39;s going to fall...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/U9vC2XL.png alt="key at edge" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>After another talk with him, I head out and grab the <strong>Temple Key!</strong></p>
<p>Back to Belome&#39;s Temple, we make for the treasure room, where we face the golden Belome...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/DfrTmei.png alt="gold belome" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>...and we give him the key, which he gobbles up, and vanishes!</p>
<p>The treasures here are now ours!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/zxDiMt2.png alt=treasures width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I grab all 8 Frog Coins, that makes it 36! I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s enough to buy the Coin Trick from Frogfucius&#39;s Student at Seaside!</p>
<p>Items next, and they&#39;re a Royal Syrup, a Max Mushroom, and a <strong>Fire Bomb</strong>!</p>
<p>Finally, the four Flowers!</p>
<p>I head back, and buy the <strong>Coin Trick</strong> (exactly 36 Frog Coins, yes!), and head to Land&#39;s End after saving.</p>

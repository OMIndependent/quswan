<p>The battle is on!</p>
<p>Now let&#39;s see what Geno&#39;s skill set has. A <strong>Geno Beam!</strong></p>
<p>I try it out, but I feel like I haven&#39;t unleashed its full power yet...</p>
<p>After our turn, Bowyer decides to even the odds. He&#39;s going to do that by shooting an arrow at a certain button, so that command is locked!</p>
<p>I like how Geno gets items from his hat...</p>
<p>At least Bowyer only blocks one command at a time!</p>
<p>Geno punches using his fist as a rocket!</p>
<p>Eventually, with Mario and Geno almost near death a few times, I finally get how to use the Geno Beam, with the final blow against Bowyer for 60 damage!</p>
<p>I also notice the Freebies I get are just one more of the item that I used!</p>
<p>I win a <strong>Flower Box</strong> after beating Bowyer!</p>
<p>Geno says that he&#39;s &quot;more than just a doll...&quot;</p>
<p>Mario and Mallow look at each other and nod.</p>
<p>So the entity, the shooting star, is using Geno the doll as its avatar.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Y34MXha.png alt="geno body" width=480 height=360></p>
<p>Mario and Mallow jump in shock.</p>
<p>So Geno&#39;s &quot;higher authority&quot; that he speaks of is in the &quot;Star Road.&quot;</p>
<p>Mario and Mallow don&#39;t know about the Star Road, though...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Geno explains about how wishes are granted, which are then transformed into shooting stars. I&#39;m guessing Gaz wished for Geno to come to life.</p>
<p>Geno also goes on to mention that the Star Road was crushed by a sword and no stars have been formed ever since. It&#39;s probably that Smithy Gang sword that fell on top of Bowser&#39;s castle at the beginning of the game that caused the Star Road to shatter...</p>
<p>Mallow notices that the Green Star is a piece of the Star Road that Geno was talking about.</p>
<p>So the shooting star possessing Geno came down to earth to fix the mess that the Smithy Gang created. He also says that there are seven of these Star Pieces total.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/hklIGsk.png alt="star true name" width=480 height=360></p>
<p>The star&#39;s true name is also hard to type...</p>
<p>So the shooting star chose Geno since, in the star&#39;s opinion, he was the strongest out of all of Gaz&#39;s toys...I&#39;m betting the star may have watched Gaz and Mario play before coming down to earth. I wonder what that also says of the star&#39;s opinion of Mario and Bowser...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/d3MXWDV.png alt="green star get" width=480 height=360></p>
<p>Now that&#39;s two Star Pieces!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/dAxC9ab.png alt="star pieces so far" width=480 height=360></p>
<p>But there&#39;s a stray arrow, one of Bowyer&#39;s minions, who overheard everything, and runs off to tell Smithy!</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Now what&#39;s our next move?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/YuJeXEN.png alt="get the seven stars" width=480 height=360></p>
<p>So it&#39;s a fetch quest, more or less...and we have 5 more Star Pieces to go!</p>
<p>And that&#39;s it for now!</p>
<p><em><strong>Aside:</strong></em> Btw, if anyone&#39;s played through this part: How long did it take for you all to get through the Forest Maze?</p>

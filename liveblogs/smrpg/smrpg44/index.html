<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>As we leave the anteroom, the congregation outside is already in the reception room!</p>
<p>Raz and Raini ask Mario if it&#39;s safe to continue the wedding now that Booster, or &quot;the creepy guy&quot; as Raz calls him, is out. Mario nods yes.</p>
<p>The couple continues living their happily ever after...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/gdJmvFz.png alt="restart wedding" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Raz tells the congregation they&#39;re going to start from the top again.</p>
<p>The green capped Toad is shaking, he really needs to go...</p>
<p>I head back in and save.</p>
<p>At the chapel hall, the congregation is in awe at the newlyweds at the altar.</p>
<p>The green-capped Toad really <strong>really</strong> needs to go, poor him...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/GOW8Agn.png alt="cant hold it" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>He runs off to the bathroom.</p>
<p>I continue talking to the congregation, still in awe. <strike>Toadofsky</strike> The organist who thinks he&#39;s Toadofsky is playing a tune on the organ...</p>

<p>Raz and Raini say &quot;I do.&quot; Mario presides over the wedding. He nonverbally tells them they&#39;re married with his &quot;Star Get!&quot; pose!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/KLheoM9.png alt="now pronounce you man & wife" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>There&#39;s also another couple at the reception room waiting for their turn to get married...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I head outside, where a family is waiting to get their picture taken.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/xArNcHR.png alt="photo session" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I have Mario be part of the photo...the photographer tells Mario not to pull a &quot;long face&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Photographer:</strong> &quot;This isn&#39;t a funeral, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>Mario brings out his best pose, the one where he gets a star!</p>
<p>The pic&#39;s taken!</p>
<p>I wander around Marrymore a bit before heading out.</p>
<p>But Peach stops us, and asks us if we&#39;re going back to the Mushroom Kingdom. She mentions the Chancellor&#39;s concern for her.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/oYhLbxy.png alt="chancellor waiting" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I say yes.</p>
<p>We leave Marrymore through the main entrance, since the other exit doesn&#39;t warp us back to the world map.</p>
<p>I wonder what would&#39;ve happened if I said no to Peach...</p>
<p>Now I see Mario walking back to the Mushroom Kingdom on foot.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/JD8SCL7.png alt="world map" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Mario leaps through high cliffs and Tadpole Pond easily to get back to the Mushroom Kingdom!</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I talk to the citizens who welcome us back. The Toad running around wants to marry Mario in a few years...then I hear a random noise...not!</p>
<p>At the Item Shop, the Shopkeeper welcomes both Mario and Mallow back. I have Mario sell his Hammer.</p>
<p>I talk to the Toad who had his wallet stolen from Croco, and he gives us a Frog Coin that he found from there, thinking it&#39;s ours!</p>
<p>I head into a house, where I read a note posted on the bedpost: this is Raz and Raini&#39;s house!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/O59lbSc.png alt="raz raini note" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>One of the Toads asks me if I rescued Peach from Bowser, who he calls a &quot;good for noth...&quot; Then, I hear the same strange noise: it&#39;s a growl from Bowser!</p>
<p>A blue capped Toad inside the west house is trying to make his meal like the one pictured in his cookbook.</p>
<p>I go see the jumping baby brother Toad in his bedroom who tells us he can outjump Mario now. I have Mario say &quot;impressive&quot;.</p>

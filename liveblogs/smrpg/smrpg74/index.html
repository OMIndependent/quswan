<p>I switch Bowser for Geno, and save at Nimbus Land before getting our bearings!</p>
<p>One of the cloud citizens mentions that a Toad&#39;s staying at the inn...</p>
<p>After talking with the townspeople for any more info, and getting more supplies, I head down into the room, where the blue Toad is sleeping.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/vuM6UL8.png alt="casino toad" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>He can&#39;t find the Casino. Poor Toad...</p>
<p>I read the leaflet on his hand. It&#39;s an ad for Grate Guy&#39;s Casino.</p>
<p>It says 3 jumps, a Bright Card, and no &quot;Chomps&quot; can get us in there. Lucky, I got into the Casino beforehand!</p>
<p>I have Mario head into Garro&#39;s house, where an angry Mallow statue is...</p>

<p>I leave for Monstro Town.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s see what I could do here...</p>
<p>After visiting the other residents, I have Mario head for the Dojo to challenge Jagger the Terrapin student there.</p>
<p>Jagger says he&#39;s not going to make this easy for us, and the fight begins!</p>

<p>I use Geno boost on Mario and Geno. If I time it right, I boost both attack and defense of the target!</p>
<p>It takes three attacks to bring Jagger to his knees!</p>
<p>He compliments Mario as a top-notch fighter.</p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;You did well for your inexperience, Jagger.&quot;<br>
<strong>Jagger:</strong> &quot;Sensei, have you been here all along?&quot;</p>
<p>Jagger walks to the bonsai plant in the corner, where his master, <strong>Jinx</strong>, is on.</p>
<p><strong>Jinx:</strong> &quot;Hmmm. You felt my <em>ki</em>, didn&#39;t you? Not bad for a novice!&quot;</p>
<p>Jinx inspects Mario with swiftness!</p>
<p>He points out Mario has holes in his fighting style.</p>
<p>Jinx moves like the wind!</p>
<p>Jinx says we can challenge him any time!</p>
<p>Not today.</p>

<p>I head to Tadpole Pond, since we&#39;re stuck...I later change my mind and head off to Booster&#39;s Tower on the way there.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/56I6bKx.png alt="booster and valentina" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Climbing up the tower, Valentina&#39;s there on the balcony, where Booster and his Snifits are...how did she get down there? Looks like Dodo ran out of energy trying to fly her away...</p>
<p>Valentina&#39;s not happy that Booster wants to marry her...</p>
<p>Booster kisses? (Or says something nice to) her, and goes off to the perch...</p>
<p>Valentina saw whatever he did as &quot;romantic,&quot; and she and Booster hang out next to each other on the perch. The Snifits look away...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/fnH6daq.png alt=perch width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Mario backs away and we head back down the tower.</p>
<p>Easier to go down than to go up!</p>
<p>I buy some fireworks at Moleville, but they&#39;re really expensive! I head to Star Hill to get more coins...</p>
<p>After buying one set of fireworks, I now go off to Tadpole Pond...</p>
<p>The tadpole nearby has a new favorite song: the one that the Monstro Town star dances to!</p>
<p>Instead of scales, five notes are played, or four notes, a rest, and a low note! The tadpole forgot the rest!</p>
<p>I listen to the tune again before saving...</p>
<p>Toadofsky&#39;s back too...</p>

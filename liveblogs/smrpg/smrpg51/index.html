<p>Traveling into a Sunken Ghost Ship feels a bit fitting for Halloween...</p>
<p>Taking <a href=http://bit.ly/2z5qK9t>Fajen Thygia&#39;s advice</a> from yesterday, I head back to Star Hill to get more coins since I&#39;m almost out of money.</p>
<p>All of the monsters on Star Hill are <strong>immune</strong> to lightning spells!</p>
<p>Bowser&#39;s also leveled up! I upgrade his physical stats!</p>
<p>I head back to Seaside Town to get the <strong>Coin Trick</strong>, but it&#39;s worth a lot of Frog Coins!</p>
<p>Passing on that, I resume the Star Piece hunt!</p>
<p>On the way to the Sunken Ship, I collect three chest blocks (the ones behind the save block and the supply of crates): a mushroom, a Flower, and a Frog Coin!</p>
<p>I save again and reread the note on the wall in the ship...</p>
<p>I also notice another note at the entrance that reads:</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>We&#39;re done for...a giant squid just got a hold of us. This ship&#39;s going down fast...</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>The Greapers know <strong>Blizzard</strong> too!</p>
<p>I forgot to point this out, but I notice that Peach is strong against magical attacks, but Mario isn&#39;t!</p>
<p>I quickly head downstairs before another Alley Rat throws me back into another battle!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The next room has Greapers guarding the cabin doors here...which one should I go into first?</p>
<p>I choose neither as I head forward into the southwest passage, where there&#39;s a <strong>Dry Bones</strong>, a chest block, and another hooded shopkeeper. Or is that the same person?</p>
<p>Looks like I bit off more than I could chew in this battle here (two Dry Bones, two Greapers, and a a Reacher), since Mario gets KO&#39;d a few times, and Peach once. Lucky I revive both of them, but Dry Bones is pretty stubborn to take care of, just like in the old games...</p>
<p>I get the chest block, which has plenty of coins!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I get stuck into the same encounter I faced before since the Dry Bones is blocking my way out! Even escaping doesn&#39;t work since I&#39;m trapped!</p>
<p>I manage to survive the second round (using a Pure Water on a Reacher!), with Peach gaining a level, and a new skill!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Sr1GvyB.png alt="peach levelup" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I upgrade her physical stats.</p>
<p>I now talk to the hooded shopkeeper...</p>
<p>He still has the same wares from the last time we met him. I buy new equipment for Mario: the <strong>Super Hammer</strong>, and a <strong>Sailor Shirt</strong>, and restock on recovery items.</p>
<p>Though, I find out the Super Hammer&#39;s weaker than the Masher by 10 pts! :(</p>
<p>The description for the Hurly Gloves for Bowser made me laugh a bit: &quot;a classic Mario Toss attack!&quot;</p>
<p>The shopkeeper gives us advice on the password with the six hints, where he mentions that it has &quot;something to do with...the sea.&quot;</p>
<p>He brings up more info.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/aj4c4rP.png alt="shopkeeper advice" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Exhausted from that five-on-three battle earlier, I go back to the entrance and save at the cabin there.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I sell back the Super Hammer to the shopkeeper, buy a Nautical Dress for Peach, and make my way down into the depths again.</p>
<p>After one battle, I get a chance to get double XP, but I get the wrong pick in the shell game, and I lose the coins I earned!</p>
<p>Geno also levels up, where he learns <strong>Geno Whirl!</strong> I boost his magical stats!</p>
<p>I eventually make it to the shopkeeper at the ship and buy another Maple Syrup from him. He tells me the same advice to open a certain cabin on the ship...</p>
<p>I then start a battle with a Greaper guarding one of the lower deck cabins...</p>
<p>Inside the cabin, there&#39;s a series of hovering J blocks with three cannons at the top of the ledge.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ONOMdH1.png alt="cannon puzzle" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>This might be the way to open the doors further into the ship.</p>
<p>Sadly, I don&#39;t have enough info, and I choose another cabin to go to, starting another battle with one of the Greapers.</p>
<p>Inside the cabin, I see a ghostly coin moving about, dropping a trail of coins its path. I get a buzzer for a wrong move (touching the moving coin) and start again.</p>
<p>I have to be quick since the dropped coins are only there for a second!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/qGTxrij.png alt="ghost coins" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>After collecting the coins from the trail, a scroll drops, and I get 160 coins from those 16 big coins!</p>
<p>The scroll gives us this hint:</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/xBBTxsh.png alt="first hint" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>&quot;<strong>It has four consonants.</strong>&quot; Hmmm...</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I take care of the last Greaper in the bottom deck, and I&#39;m now at a room with two green switch pads, a door forward, and a save block!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/21X2OY9.png alt="two switch pads" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I probably need to have Mario press them both at the same time...</p>
<p>I head up to the top decks and fight the Greaper guarding the west cabin.</p>
<p>Mario gains another level! I boost his physical stats!</p>
<p>So does Mallow! I boost Mallow&#39;s magical stats!</p>
<p>In the cabin, I&#39;m greeted with this prompt:</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/1gLy12J.png alt="3d maze" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>And I can forfeit crossing the maze by pressing X, or triangle.</p>
<p>This is a tricky maze...</p>
<p>I keep jumping randomly at certain spots here.</p>
<p>With some luck and effort, I make it to the top of the maze and hit the switch pad!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/4cia7ur.png alt="top o the maze" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>A scroll (another hint!) and an item (a <strong>Royal Syrup!</strong>) drops!</p>
<p>I toss away a Maple Syrup in exchange for the new item.</p>
<p>The next hint says: &quot;<strong>It has two vowels.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> By the way, if anyone&#39;s made it to this point, how long did it take for you to finish this ship&#39;s maze?</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I get the next Greaper guarding the cabin in the middle.</p>
<p>I&#39;m now in another room with moving bouncepads and floating J blocks above!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/JjHVtXc.png alt=bouncepads width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Now what am I supposed to do here?</p>
<p>So the blocks stop the bouncepads. Once all the bouncepads are stopped, a cannonball drops! So I have to make sure the cannonball bounces all the way to the green switch pad...</p>
<p>It&#39;s all a matter of timing on this puzzle...</p>
<p>After a few tries, the cannonball lands on the switch!</p>
<p>A Flower and another hint drop down!</p>
<p>The third hint: &quot;<strong>It is found on the bed of the ocean.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Now to get the fourth hint...</p>
<p>The Straw Head zombifies Peach with a <strong>Stench</strong>!</p>
<p>Bowser gains another level, and learns <strong>Poison Gas</strong>! Oooooh! I increase his attack power.</p>
<p>I&#39;m now in a room with a flying Koopa and a big cannonball stacked on top of J crates!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/JSFdSZQ.png alt="koopa room" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The cannonball drops and then disappears!</p>
<p>I figure out that I have to lure the Koopa to push the cannonball to fall where the switchpad is. Easy win!</p>
<p>A Mushroom and another hint drop!</p>
<p>This hint says that <strong>there is an &quot;s&quot; in the password.</strong></p>
<p>I save before taking on the last puzzle.</p>
<p><a name=6></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The lower floating J block I hit launches the left cannon.</p>
<p>This is probably another timed puzzle. All I need to do is to have Mario jump and hit the cannonball at the right moment so it will hit the J block on top, which will activate the other cannonball, and so on.</p>
<p>I get it right on the third try!</p>
<p>A Mushroom (the item) and the final hint drops down.</p>
<p>Van Doren&#39;s hint says that &quot;<strong>at least...two consonants are side by side.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>So I&#39;ve collected five hints so far. There are supposed to be six, but I&#39;m reminded of what the shopkeeper told me, that I won&#39;t get them all. I need to &quot;deduce&quot; the password from the hints, he says.</p>
<p>I switch Peach for Mallow and save again.</p>

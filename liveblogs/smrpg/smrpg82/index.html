<p>Back to the gate we go!</p>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/0gFhGpTYX9U>I hear clanging sounds, and the music for the final point in this game comes forth! It&#39;s epic!</a></p>
<p>In the next area, I&#39;m now stuck...how to cross this one?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/3ULdqw5.png alt="metal bridge" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>If Mario falls, a bouncepad at the bottom bounces him back to the same area again!</p>
<p>I figure it out quickly: All I have to do is jump on the double nut to move it to the other side, and slowly inch my way there to prevent any falls!</p>
<p>On the other side now, where there&#39;s a save block, and I save since my Pi&#39;s getting exhausted trying to run the game...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>There&#39;s a Glum Reaper floating around in between the next nut-and-bolt bridge...</p>
<p>With care, I cross, and I fall, worried that I might get into another encounter with the monster!</p>
<p>On the second try, I get into one battle, where one of them uses their <strong>Scythe</strong> to KO Peach!</p>
<p>I use a Pick Me Up to revive Peach!</p>
<p>I finish crossing only to encounter a puddle, which is actually an <strong>Ameboid!</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> I noticed just now that the Ameboid looks like a Goomba...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/w0tsGcb.png alt=ameboid width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>That was easy!</p>
<p>Now where to cross next?</p>
<p>I head southeast...</p>
<p>After getting into another battle with more Glum Reapers, Peach levels up!</p>
<p>In the next chamber, there&#39;s a switch button, and plenty of Ameboids dropping from the ledge, and bouncing around! I turn back, and head for the switch button!</p>
<p>I stomp on the switch, opening a passage! I head forward, where a save block is, along with a hidden chest block!</p>
<p>I search for the chest block, which has a mushroom restoring our health, and save at this point.</p>
<p>Out of curiosity, I have Mario move on ahead, where there&#39;s a bouncepad and a chest block...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Jmr8zrx.png alt="ultra hammer get" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>...containing an <strong>Ultra Hammer!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yes!!!</strong></p>
<p>I check the stats for the Ultra Hammer, but it&#39;s weaker than the Lazy Shell Mario has now...I&#39;ll probably sell this one.</p>
<p>I have Mario cross through the nut-and-bolt bridge...</p>
<p>Takes me a few tries to make it, and to take the bouncepad beyond.</p>
<p>The bouncepad takes us down below to the deeper depths of the rift...</p>

<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/hXiiygP.png alt="alarm clock startle" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>A large alarm clock embedded in the floor rings, startling Mario!</p>
<p>The clock&#39;s bells ring, shouting &quot;It&#39;s &#39;Mario&#39;!&quot; They&#39;re not happy about us being here, and a boss fight ensues!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/NBhu32s.png alt="count down" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>So <strong>Count Down</strong> and the <strong>Ding-a-Lings</strong> (the bells) are the bosses...</p>
<p>I have the whole party attack the Count, but the bells have other ideas...</p>
<p>One of them tolls a Doom Reverb for Bowser.</p>
<p>Count Down keeps a really tight schedule...for every &quot;hour,&quot; or turn, they use a certain spell!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/WGZbwnF.png alt="3 oclock" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>They recover health at 3:00...</p>
<p>I have the party focus on the left bell in the next turn!</p>
<p>One of them rings a Roulette on us, landing on Bowser!</p>
<p>Other attacks they have are Dark Star so far...</p>
<p>At 5:00, the Count lulls everyone into sleep with Aurora Flash, and a Fear Roulette and one hit strikes both Mario and Peach down!</p>
<p>This time, I switch Bowser out and put Geno in.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I have Geno boost Mario&#39;s attack, and with a rightly timed button press, his defense as well! But, how are we going to counter against their Roulette and Doom?</p>
<p>After a few turns of attacks, the right bell casts Spore Chimes, turning Peach into a mushroom!</p>
<p>At 6:00, the Count &quot;fully recovers&quot; the left bell...but only 300 HP!</p>
<p>Eventually, we take care of the left bell...</p>
<p>At 7:00, the Count Water Blasts us!</p>
<p>The Fear Roulette strikes, KO&#39;ing Mario!</p>
<p>At 9:00, the Count takes a break...</p>
<p>Peach gets turned into a scarecrow by the bell on the right!</p>
<p>At 10:00, the Count uses Petal Blast, and turn almost everyone into mushrooms!</p>
<p>I have Peach recover everyone!</p>
<p>At high noon, the Count uses Corona!</p>
<p>Another Roulette takes out Geno! Lucky, Peach&#39;s revive spell costs as little as 2 FP!</p>
<p>I boost Mario and have Mario finish off the right bell.</p>
<p>Now it&#39;s the Count who&#39;s left standing...</p>
<p>And in a few turns of the clock, everyone gets turned into mushrooms via Petal Blast, unable to move!</p>
<p>The Count&#39;s clock keeps ticking until Geno changes back!</p>
<p>I use up the last Able Juice to recover Peach, and Mario turns back just in time!</p>
<p>I have Geno boost Mario&#39;s attack and defense!</p>
<p>The battle continues, and eventually, the Count literally loses face!</p>
<p>Peach levels up! I boost her physical stats!</p>
<p>In the place of the vanquished Count Down, there&#39;s a save block in the corner, and a bouncepad further east...I save here again.</p>
<p>Looks like there&#39;s no going back after this, huh? At the worst time too, since I&#39;m almost out of Pick Me Ups and I have no Able Juices left...</p>

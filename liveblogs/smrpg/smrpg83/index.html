<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>I have Mario bounce off deeper into the depths of the rift.</p>
<p>The bouncepad below takes us back to the nut-and-bolt bridge before our fight with Count Down...</p>
<p>Whoa, wait a moment, are those...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/64jhqUD.png alt="axem clones what?" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The whole place is creating an assembly line of Axem Rangers!</p>
<p>But there&#39;s a chest block above the top conveyor that I want to get...</p>
<p>And a monochrome Axem Ranger drops on Mario and a battle starts!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/e8217mO.png alt="axem clones fight" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>They have the same moves, but at least these monsters are weaker than their original counterparts.</p>
<p>I get caught into another battle with the Assembly Line!Axem Rangers again!</p>
<p>The chest block contains a recovery mushroom!</p>
<p>I leap on to the platform, and take another to make it to another conveyor belt delivering more Axem copies!</p>
<p>After a long fight with them, I get into another!</p>
<p>Holy heck, look at the Smithy weapons getting crafted!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/i1YxhO0.png alt="more weapons" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Smithy&#39;s trying to build an army at this point. He&#39;s that desperate. I&#39;m thinking Count Down probably alerted him that we were coming and is now in overtime trying to use all his skills to trying to stop us...</p>
<p>...and a stray arrow from the sky spins Mario around!</p>
<p>I have to watch my step at this point!</p>
<p>New monsters <strong>Jabit</strong>, <strong>Pounder</strong>, and <strong>Poundette</strong> are anthropomorphic hammers and a spear!</p>
<p>Smithy&#39;s assembly line&#39;s even making Shy Guys on pogo sticks!</p>
<p>Mack copies are also being made...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/hPLyFrY.png alt="mack clones" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I proceed forward, hoping to stop the stray arrows...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>But no go, as I&#39;m in another battle with a Mack clone and his four Shy Guys on pogo sticks!</p>
<p>Easy win!</p>
<p>Avoiding the push of the conveyor betls pushing us down into the abyss, we see Boos patrolling the factory...</p>
<p>We dodge them, and fall down trying to reach the next set of conveyors...</p>
<p>Luckily, we bounce back up to where we were last time and grab a nearby chest block, which has <strong>Royal Syrup!</strong></p>
<p>I make a bounding leap for the platform on the last conveyor, and make it!</p>
<p>But on the other side, I get too eager as I accidentally touch a Boo! <strong>Li&#39;l Boos</strong>, a <strong>Duppel</strong>, and a <strong>Puppox</strong> are the new enemies...</p>
<p>The Li&#39;l Boos are quick dodgers!</p>
<p>I get into another battle with a Li&#39;l Boo...</p>
<p>Now where to next?</p>
<p>I leap for the chest block north of Mario, jumping to get there, and get a <strong>Max Mushroom!</strong></p>
<p>Now east, more conveyor belts...</p>
<p>The Li&#39;l Boos are strong against Geno&#39;s beams!</p>
<p>The next area, there&#39;s a staircase of conveyor belts, propping down assembly line copies of Bowyer!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there&#39;s no way to avoid the Bowyer copies while ascending...</p>
<p>The copy even has the X, Y, and A buttons to seal commands!</p>
<p>He&#39;s one of the stronger copies in this area...and he&#39;s locked out the A button!</p>
<p>I try sealing his spells with Peach&#39;s Mute, no good...</p>
<p>Two Geno Beams and several hits later, the Bowyer clone&#39;s finished!</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Past that, and now, Axem clones block our way, strafing left and right!</p>
<p>I get caught into another battle, where thanks to Axem Pink&#39;s clone, the party gets turned into mushrooms...</p>
<p>Now I have to wait a few turns...</p>
<p>And we take care of them...</p>
<p>It&#39;s all a matter of timing and placement, trying to dodge a battle with these Axem clones.</p>
<p>Though after another bout with them, Mario and Mallow gain a level!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/DCufbw2.png alt="axem clones strafe" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>In the middle of a pickle now...</p>
<p>And I jump too early again!</p>
<p>Bowser levels up!</p>
<p>I climb another staircase of conveyor belts, where I&#39;m now fighting another Bowyer clone!</p>
<p>I take no chances and boost Geno&#39;s and Mario&#39;s physical stats!</p>
<p>Bowyer seals our use of items...not to worry!</p>
<p>After our semi-long efforts, a save block&#39;s there!</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>In the next area, devil guards patrol the area and clones of Yaridovich jump down to the gray block in the center!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/tRQy0Lg.png alt="yari down" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I have Mario go northwest, and collect the items there, which have a mushroom and an extra Flower!</p>
<p>I head back. Since there&#39;s no way around him, I fight the Yaridovich clone!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/uDZaKKl.png alt="yari clone" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The Yaridovich clone has his typical set of spells.</p>
<p>But the clone splits into four tiny spears!</p>
<p>After finishing them off, the Yaridovich clone&#39;s back!</p>
<p>But after two turns, he&#39;s done!</p>
<p>Peach levels up! So does Geno!</p>
<p>After we finish off the Yaridovich clone, the gray block blows up, revealing a hole below...</p>
<p>Being wary, I save again, and jump into the abyss...</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The whole rift shakes at the impact of Mario&#39;s landing!</p>
<p>We now stand before two bosses: <strong>Cloaker</strong> and <strong>Domino</strong>, who&#39;ve trapped us, and now want to...<em>play around</em> for a few minutes...eeeee...that&#39;s creepy.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/zAV8Yt6.png alt="c and d" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Domino&#39;s the spellcaster, and Cloaker&#39;s the boulder slinger!</p>
<p>I have Mario attack Cloaker, since I think he&#39;s the greater danger, with Peach healing, and Geno boosting the party&#39;s physical stats.</p>
<p>It seems that Cloaker&#39;s defending himself, since our attacks against him are getting a bit weaker...</p>
<p>I change my target to Domino.</p>
<p>Now Cloaker stands alone, still in shock that we&#39;re tougher than he thought!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/c0Iax2S.png alt="dont like where this going" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>You don&#39;t even know, Cloaker...</p>
<p>He runs, but we chase him...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ufGOEyw.png alt="earth link" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>...where he&#39;s standing in front of a massive cobra! Oh god... <img class=emojione alt=â˜¹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Cloaker jumps on the cobra, <strong>Earth Link</strong>, and round two begins!</p>
<p>We take care of the giant cobra first!</p>
<p>As its nature, Earth Link poisons Mario!</p>
<p>While Cloaker&#39;s up high attacking us, the giant cobra&#39;s dealing heavy damage!</p>
<p>We keep concentrating our attacks on the giant cobra...</p>
<p>After the giant cobra&#39;s taken care of, Cloaker&#39;s finished as well!</p>
<p>Another accidental encounter with a Yaridovich clone later, we use the bouncepad to head back up and go back to the save block!</p>

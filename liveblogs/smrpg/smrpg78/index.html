<p>Back to the six rooms...</p>
<p>I have Mario head for Door #3.</p>
<p>More battles!</p>
<p>Round 1: Five Gu Goombas!</p>
<p>The Gu Goombas are poisonous!</p>
<p>Round 2: Malakoopas and a Tub-o-Troopa!</p>
<p>Round 3: Two Big Boos and two Orbisons!</p>
<p>I&#39;m getting lots of bonus boost flowers in this round!</p>
<p>Round 4: Sling Shys, or Shy Guys in green!</p>
<p>I&#39;m conserving my Flower Points since I know I&#39;m in for a long haul of battles...</p>
<p>Round 5: Chewys and Shy Aways!</p>
<p>I take on another shell game and win double coins instead of double XP!</p>
<p>Round 6: A Mr. Kipper and two <strong>Muckles</strong>!</p>
<p>Round 7: Two Amanitas and an Orbison!</p>
<p>Round 8: Two Greapers and a new monster: the <strong>Glum Reaper</strong>!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Now the final door and four more rounds of battles!</p>
<p>Round 9: A trio of Pyrospheres!</p>
<p>And Mario and Mallow level up!</p>
<p>Round 10: A trio of Lakitus!</p>
<p>Now the eleventh round: Two Shamans and two Zeostars...</p>
<p>The final round: A group of Shamans!</p>
<p>Let&#39;s hope the Geno Blast works...</p>
<p>Half of the Shamans run away!</p>
<p>Only one&#39;s now left, brave enough to face us, and he casts a Blizzard on us!</p>
<p>And that&#39;s it!</p>
<p>After doubling out XP in this shell game, Bowser levels up!</p>
<p>We head to the next room. Now what&#39;s our prize?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/TBSAvPh.png alt="2nd prize" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>It&#39;s a <strong>Star Gun</strong> for Geno!</p>
<p>Two more doors left to go through, and it&#39;s only the puzzles and the action courses left!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ZlY1FjD.png alt="two more doors" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I have Mario go through Door #6.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>It&#39;s one of the puzzle courses!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ivno99p.png alt="puzzle setup" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The setup is this: there&#39;s a yellow platform, and a raised platform. On the raised platform, there&#39;s a chest, and a big Hammer Bro at the northern edge. The door forward is way high up on the other side, where there&#39;s no floor to get to...</p>
<p>I jump on the platfom, where the big Hammer Bro introduces himself...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/zeOGzqX.png alt="enter dr topper" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The so-called quiz master, Dr. Topper, asks me if I want to start this challenge. I ask for instructions.</p>
<p>He explains there&#39;s 21 coins in the chest block above us, and that the one who takes the last coin <strong>loses!</strong></p>
<p>I can take up at most 4 coins at a time, but if I want to get fewer than that, I can stop Mario from getting any more coins.</p>
<p>So now we take turns grabbing the coins. I have Mario grab two coins first, then Dr. Topper gets one.</p>
<p>I do the same on the next turn...</p>
<p>I calculate how much coins are left after my third turn. 11 more...</p>
<p>Now Dr. Topper gets bold, and leaps for four coins!</p>
<p>I win!</p>
<p>Now the platform takes me to my next challenge, where Dr. Topper awaits!</p>
<p>It&#39;s <strong>Magic Buttons!</strong></p>
<p>So if I step on one switch button, the buttons around it reverse their switch state. In Dr. Topper&#39;s words: &quot;ON becomes OFF, and OFF becomes ON.&quot;</p>
<p>This is almost borderline <em>Alundra</em> difficulty here...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/FV1O6B3.png alt="magic buttons" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Sixteen buttons in a four by four grid...hmmm, this might be doable.</p>
<p>I think through this puzzle in my head first.</p>
<p>Since the switch buttons only turn on surrounding buttons, I&#39;m assuming first that it turns on the buttons that are horizontally and vertically next to the one I might press. I&#39;m a bit worried, though, that the buttons might be press the ones diagonally adjacent to it...</p>
<p>I make my guess and have Mario press buttons 15, 9, 8, and 2... </p>
<p>...and I did it!</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Next puzzle: <strong>Ball Solitaire!</strong></p>
<p>So I have Mario kick a ball, which will &quot;leapfrog&quot; past the ball next to it, and the ball that&#39;s hit by the one Mario kicked, vanishes. Now I have to keep making the balls disappear until one is left. But I lose if I kick a ball that lands at a space where another ball previously was...</p>
<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> ...or if I can&#39;t make any more moves, I think.</p>
<p>Dr. Topper starts by vanishing one ball.</p>
<p>There&#39;s 15 of them...</p>
<p>I have trouble doing this puzzle.</p>
<p>I slowly start to get this one now...</p>
<p>I start with Ball 11, then 5, 9, 8, and 12, and I lose! <img class=emojione alt=â˜¹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Back to door #6.</p>
<p>I do all of Dr. Topper&#39;s puzzles all over again from the beginning...</p>
<p>I almost lost count of the coins I got in the first puzzle, but I manage to win that one!</p>
<p>I cruise by the second puzzle and get my second chance on the third puzzle!</p>
<p>After a few offline interruptions, I&#39;m back!</p>
<p>This is going to take me a bit of a while here...</p>
<p>Looks like I see some hope here!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/FDZ4bpz.png alt="puzzle almost done" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Now the final kick!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/kChJxS2.png alt="final kick" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Topper:</strong> &quot;Heh...Wow! Simple as ABC, eh!?&quot; Not really...</p>
<p>I cross into the door...</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>...and I win my prize: <strong>Rock Candy</strong>!</p>
<p>I toss out a Freshen Up to put the Rock Candy in!</p>
<p>I use a save state at this point before going into Door #1.</p>
<p>It&#39;s an action course, where three Terrapins run away, and a whole pool of lava below! Everytime the Terrapins jump, the passages where I can cross become visible. I only have 10 tries to cross this invisible bridge...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Ah3eELt.png alt="lava vanishing bridge" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I collect a few chests along the way, which include a Fright Bomb, an Ice Bomb, Rock Candy, and Royal Syrup, though it costs me 6 lives to get to all of them...</p>
<p>Into the next room, where a set of moving platforms await...and I only have 4 tries to get this right...</p>
<p>Following the patterns of the platforms, I carefully cross to the other side, though the chests are tempting to get...</p>
<p>I get an additional Flower!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/fAQ2hMF.png alt="dk climb" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Crossing into the next room, I find no lava! Thank goodness! What could possibly go--</p>
<p>This obstacle is super similar 3D version of the classic <em>Donkey Kong</em>!</p>
<p>I turn back before catching my breath and trying my luck at the course.</p>
<p>Two tries left...</p>
<p>It&#39;s a chaos of barrels!</p>
<p>Now one more go at this!</p>
<p>But I fail and I&#39;m back at the entrance!</p>
<p>I&#39;m getting a bit stressed out here, so I make a save state and stop at this point for tonight...</p>

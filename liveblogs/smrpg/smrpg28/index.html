<p>Inside, I see a worried Ma&#39;Mole...she leaves, probably to dig from the outside into the mines.</p>

<p>The way into the mines, according to the other two moles, is blocked. They&#39;re wishing Mario would come and help out...</p>
<p>I wonder how these moles know about Mario...</p>
<p>The moles turn around, and see Mario!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ER7jOMu.png alt="moles meet mario" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I let Mario say that he knows the story, and that we&#39;ll help!</p>
<p>With the moles&#39; help, I have Mario jump up and head into the mines!</p>
<p>Inside, I get into another battle, mistaking a <strong>Magmite</strong> for a rock, with their other friends, a <strong>Bob-omb</strong> and a <strong>Sparky!</strong></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/niKUcPu.png alt=magmite width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The Magmite&#39;s got very strong defense!</p>
<p>Mario levels up, and I give him more attack power.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Along the way, I get into more battles, especially with <strong>Clusters</strong>, who use Crystal, and they self-destruct, taking out Geno!</p>
<p>I give Mallow more health as a level up bonus.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a greedy Toad who&#39;s looking for a rare item here and wants to sell it!</p>
<p>I jump down and follow the sign arrows...</p>
<p>Now, which way should I go?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/r7Oo1En.png alt="which way" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I go west first, but double-back east out of curiosity, where that part is caved in...</p>
<p>The bounce spring probably could take me back...</p>
<p><strong>Probably not!</strong> Mario hits his head on the cave ceiling, and falls unconscious...</p>

<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Tmn6ZYn.png alt="croco again" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Croco!</strong> So the bounce spring was a trap...</p>
<p>He and his minions take all of our coins!</p>
<p>Croco jumps on Mario before he and his cronies run east!</p>
<p>I pursue them, where they&#39;re now at the dead end...but Croco pulls out a Bob-omb from his bag! He uses it to destroy the rubble, and runs off, with his minions following suit!</p>
<p>On the way, I meet an <strong>Enigma</strong>, who uses Echofinder to block special attacks!</p>
<p>Geno levels up, where I increase his magical attack and defense!</p>
<p>While chasing Croco, I find some hiding Crooks, and try to take care of them, but some of them run away!</p>
<p>He didn&#39;t have the coins, but we get a <strong>Flower Tab</strong> after fighting him!</p>
<p>I find another set of Crooks, hiding behind the bounce spring!</p>
<p>However, my controller runs out of power! jfhashhglhquiehygeru,jbzdhbjgerajghiueruhligeurb!</p>
<p>Using the keyboard, I save my progress into a save state, and switch off the game! For some reason, the game easily overheats my Raspberry Pi at times, slowing the game down too!</p>

<p>I later found out from a map online that the last clue came from the room before the password room. The clue only came down if I pressed the two green switch pads at the same time!</p>
<p>Just for fun, I try to hit both switch pads in the room before heading deeper into the ship...</p>
<p>I accidentally drop a stray barrel to the floor, and I have Mario roll it to one of the switch pads and have Mario press the other one.</p>
<p>Nothing happens. Is it because I defeated the giant Blooper earlier?</p>
<p>Into the depths we go!</p>
<p>I avoid the Dry Bones and jump a stack of crates to get to the upper deck&#39;s door forward.</p>
<p>In the next chamber, I see a set of cannons firing Bullet Bills with Alley Rats on top of them!</p>
<p>I pick a fight with an Alley Rat to stop the cannon from firing, no good.</p>
<p>I make it past the brigade of firing cannons and head downstairs into another mini maze of crates, where chest blocks are floating atop of them!</p>
<p>There&#39;s a small gap in the wall of crates that&#39;s too small to cross over...</p>
<p>I head to the door, where I&#39;m greeted by a double Mario!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/kyHStzf.png alt="double mario" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I cross into the next passage...</p>
<p>Well, that was interesting!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I get into another fight with a Dry Bones group. It turns out that to take care of a Dry Bones, I have to use fire, or Pure Water. Physical attacks don&#39;t do anything to them!</p>
<p>Peach also gains a level! I upgrade her health.</p>
<p>Geno does too! I upgrade his physical stats!</p>
<p>And I get into another round with the resurrected Dry Bones!</p>
<p>Like in the old games, a jump attack also takes out the Dry Bones!</p>
<p>Two &quot;<strong>LUCKY!</strong>&quot; flowers for Mallow!</p>
<p>I head down the stairs after beating the Dry Bones, where I get a mushroom from a chest block that restores our health, and a save block!</p>
<p>I check a map online to see if I missed anything...I turn back to fetch the remaining chest blocks in this area.</p>
<p>After stumbling upon two battles along the way, I make it on top of the crates!</p>
<p>The pair of chest blocks above the stack of J crates both have 10 big coins, or 100 coins!</p>
<p>In the room with the Mario double, I reveal a cleverly hidden J block, and a hidden chest block!</p>
<p>Using Mario&#39;s double, I get the chest block, which has a KeroKero Cola!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/fWP6riJ.png alt="mario double 2" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Bye, Mario Double, and thanks for the help!</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Phew, I almost get into <strong>another</strong> battle with Dry Bones&#39;s crew!</p>
<p>I use the stairway and crates to make it to the other side of the room, where a chest block lies!</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, I open the chest block, which has a mimic monster, a <strong>Hidon!</strong></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/yJHEWQp.png alt=hidon width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The Hidon has a Piranha Plant inside, chomping Mallow!</p>
<p>Let&#39;s see what some fireballs do...</p>
<p>...nothing!</p>
<p>Now the Hidon summons <strong>Goombettes</strong>, or <a href=http://mariowiki.com/Micro_Goomba><strong>Micro Goombas</strong></a>, to the fray!</p>
<p>I use Bowser&#39;s Terrorize attack, which only does moderate damage!</p>
<p>Lucky the Goombettes aren&#39;t much of a threat to Bowser, but to Mallow, they are!</p>
<p>Using Bowser&#39;s Chain Chomp and Mario&#39;s jump, we finish off the Hidon!</p>
<p>The Goombettes follow suit!</p>
<p>We get a <strong>Safety Badge</strong>, which prevents any poison or silence on the wearer!</p>
<p>I have Mallow equip the Safety Badge, and jump back to save before heading forward.</p>

<hr>
<p>It looks like we&#39;re getting into the deeper end of the ship now...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/fWnuf1S.png alt="deeper end" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I go into the next door, where a whirlpool is, and I have Mario dive into the whirlpool.</p>
<p>Carefully avoiding the green Cheep Cheeps, I collect the four Frog Coins in the submerged previous area, and head to the door forward.</p>
<p>In the next room, I get into a battle with the starfish, a <strong>Zeostar</strong>, and its tougher looking friends, <strong>Crusty</strong> and <strong>Leuko</strong>!</p>
<p>The Leuko&#39;s spell, <strong>Solidify</strong>, is a freeze! And its <strong>Static E!</strong> is a bit shocking!</p>
<p>But the Leuko has low physical defense!</p>
<p>Mario levels up to 13, where I boost his magical stats!</p>
<p>It seems I&#39;m almost out of FP too...</p>
<p>I get into another battle with the green Cheep Cheep, or a group of <strong>Mr. Kippers</strong>!</p>
<p>Scanning Mr. Kipper, his mind says that he&#39;s &quot;a very fresh fish.&quot;</p>
<p>Mallow levels up too!</p>
<p>More battles to go on the way down...and I meet our first <strong>Blooper</strong>!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/TLy0dem.png alt=blooper width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Looks like the Yoshi shell game also takes XP if I pick the wrong egg!</p>
<p>It&#39;s also the first time in battle that I have Mario heal Bowser, I think?</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>In the next room, there&#39;s Blooper and three tiny Bloopers, along with a secret door hidden behind barrels!</p>
<p>I pick up a <strong>Safety Ring</strong>, which prevents any instant KOs!</p>
<p>I give Mario the ring, which boosts his defenses a bit.</p>
<p>I wonder if there&#39;s any way to jump back to the surface here?</p>
<p>Reading the map again, I then have Mario climb the barrel stacks back to solid land! Then, I have him swim to the other corner in the room to fetch the lone Frog Coin there!</p>
<p>In the next room, there&#39;s pirates, and they&#39;re all sharks!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/nZLdVBU.png alt="who are you" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Pirate:</strong> &quot;What? You&#39;re lookin&#39; fer a STAR? I&#39;ll let ya see stars, arr harr harr!&quot;</p>
<p>Another pirate tells us that anything that falls into the sea belongs to &quot;Johnny.&quot;</p>
<p>And they&#39;re not letting us pass without a fight!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/cxIKe3e.png alt="bandana red" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>They&#39;re easy pickings! We overpower them to the point where the last one runs away!</p>
<p>Bowser gains enough XP to reach level 13! I increase his physical stats even further!</p>
<p>The pirate sharks now know our strength and alert their upper deck mates!</p>
<p>I hit the chest block, which contains a mushroom that restores our health and flowers!</p>
<p>Upstairs bound, pirate sharks come down, spears at the ready, accidentally stomping over Mario on the way down!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/s1ng3rO.png alt="mario runover" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>They think they scared him off, but give a double take and make chase!</p>
<p>We&#39;re surrounded!</p>
<p>But the pirate sharks at the top of the stairs throw a barrel, where Mario ducks and bowls over their fellow crewmates instead!</p>
<p>We climb the stairs where five pirate sharks greet us!</p>
<p>They&#39;re also easy wins! But Mallow takes the most damage from them! <img class=emojione alt=â˜¹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>They let us through to see their leader, Johnny.</p>

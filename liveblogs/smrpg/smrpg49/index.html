<p>We now head to Seaside Town, which has the same music as Rose Town.</p>
<p>The town looks empty...</p>
<p>I talk to a pair of gray Toads before a house. They&#39;re guarding something.</p>
<p>I save my progress at the inn before trying to figure out what&#39;s going on here...</p>
<p>The Toad innkeeper standing on the table says the rooms are on the house. I&#39;m reminded of <em>Breath of Fire</em> again...I have Mario pass that offer.</p>
<p>I head upstairs. Nothing to see here...</p>
<p>All of the Toads are gray-looking, and they can&#39;t stop pacing.</p>
<p>One mentions that to get into the ocean, I have to jump in the whirlpools...</p>
<p>I also have to meet with the village elder in his house. But, where is it?</p>
<p>One Toad in another room tells me I have three Star Pieces to go...how does he know that?</p>
<p>Heading northwest, I see the ocean.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/nQleC6T.png alt="ocean or lake?" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I head back, and go to the lone house without the spinning mushroom signs: the Elder&#39;s house.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Heading upstairs, I see a frog reading a book...he remembers us back when he was a tadpole!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/8c3jONs.png alt="frogfucius student" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>So he&#39;s traveling to &quot;find himself,&quot; in a way.</p>
<p>Frogfucius&#39;s student also notices something&#39;s quiet, and not right in the town as well.</p>
<p>But he can exchange Frog Coins for items!</p>
<p>There&#39;s a <strong>See Ya</strong> (can run away from battles), <strong>Earlier Times</strong> (undoes a battle), an <strong>Experience Booster</strong> (doubles the wearer&#39;s XP), a <strong>Coin Trick</strong> (double the coins when equipped), and a <strong>Scrooge Ring</strong> (cuts FP use in half!).</p>
<p>I head downstairs to talk to the Elder, who&#39;s been expecting us!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/XlgrrLs.png alt="pleasing my superiors" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The way he said that phrase &quot;pleasing [his] superiors&quot; raises my suspicions about him.</p>
<p>He tells us that there&#39;s a Star Piece in the ocean that we need to get for him.</p>
<p>He also mentions that the Star Piece is in &quot;Jonathan Jones&quot; territory, and that we can beat him (or at least that&#39;s what he thinks).</p>
<p>Hmmmm...</p>
<p>One of the &quot;shopkeepers&quot; mentions a &quot;pirate&quot;, which he dashes to his other friend, comes back, and corrects himself, mentioning Jonathan Jones again.</p>
<p>The other &quot;shopkeeper&quot; mentions Jonathan Jones too...</p>
<p>I head to the next room in the shop building, where a &quot;customer&quot; walks around the stall. The &quot;shopkeeper&quot; there has supplies like a Bad Mushroom, a Muku Cookie, and bombs!</p>
<p>I purchase two Bad Mushrooms, and leave to the inn to save.</p>
<p>Seaside Town is probably a pirate town, I&#39;m guessing.</p>

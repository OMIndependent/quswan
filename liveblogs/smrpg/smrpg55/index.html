<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>Before I head back to Seaside, I double check the guest room to see if that certain person is there. They&#39;re not...</p>
<p>I head up to the Princess&#39;s room, where her grandma is doubling for her while she&#39;s away.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/2IAx4Pj.png alt="peach double" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Peach thanks her for all that she did for her...</p>
<p>Grandma tells Peach to see the world, make friends, and destroy Smithy.</p>
<p>Peach says since that Mario&#39;s with her, everything will be all right...awww...</p>
<p>She bids her grandma well and the grandma turns back into the Princess...</p>
<p>Now, back to business.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The Elder and his &quot;citizens&quot; greet us the moment we head into town, with a gleeful smile on his face...I knew this wasn&#39;t going to be good...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/8PuS7ot.png alt="elder hee" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>&quot;Elder&quot;:</strong> &quot;But your journey ends here. You are so gullible. Don&#39;t you know who I am?&quot;</p>
<p>The facade is removed as he reveals himself to be one of Smithy&#39;s gang members, <strong>Yaridovich!</strong></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/gVqSRsq.png alt="yaridovich intro" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>He says &quot;his impersonation of an ordinary person was flawless.&quot; That&#39;s questionable...</p>
<p>Yaridovich wants to win Smithy&#39;s good graces, or &quot;brownie points,&quot; and in order to do that, he has to get the fifth Star Piece back to him!</p>
<p>I have Mario tell him to shove off.</p>
<p>He responds as I expected he would, but he throws in one snag: the actual inhabitants of Seaside Town!</p>
<p>One of Yaridovich&#39;s cronies scurries into the west house, and gets one of the citizens in there!</p>
<p>Oh my god! Did he actually...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/rT3mWMw.png alt=ack width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Yaridovich:</strong> &quot;Now isn&#39;t it a shame for an innocent old man to be tickled...like this?&quot; Lol...</p>
<p>But, I have no other choice but to give him the Star Piece, since it&#39;s a &quot;but thou must&quot; scenario...</p>
<p>I have Mario willingly give it up!</p>
<p>Yaridovich thinks of himself very highly...with labels like &quot;genius&quot;, and very &quot;important&quot;.</p>
<p>He and his goons scurry west...</p>
<p>The door to the west house is locked!</p>
<p>I have Mario pursue Yaridovich!</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Blade, Yaridovich&#39;s ride, however, is late.</p>
<p>Yaridovich notices Mario, and tries to swim away!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/uRjfPIq.png alt="johnny jumps" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Johnny! Yes!</strong></p>
<p>Johnny threatens to make Yaridovich walk the plank for stealing the Star Piece, and for trying to get away, from Mario!</p>
<p>One of Johnny&#39;s Bandana Blues tells him to let Mario do the work of taking care of Yaridovich.</p>
<p>Yaridovich, you&#39;re surrounded!</p>
<p>But, he has a trick up his sleeve!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/JM1a7Ou.png alt="group formation" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Yaridovich and his &quot;Toads&quot; form up into their true form!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/DV6vTdq.png alt="yaridovich true" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>He looks like a spear...<a href=https://youtu.be/UQl7wDCKXSM>and the boss battle music sounds different this time!</a></p>
<p>Yaridovich&#39;s opening move is a <strong>Water Blast!</strong></p>
<p>Scanning Yaridovich, he&#39;s worried about his reputation: &quot;<strong>My promotion&#39;s at stake!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>I try Bowser&#39;s new move, which does little damage to him!</p>
<p>Yaridovich now casts <strong>Flame Stone</strong>, which is a Meteor spell on one target!</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>After attacking him a bit, he performs his <strong>Mirage</strong> move!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Z8S1L9N.png alt="yarid double" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Now which one to hit?</p>
<p>Using Mallow&#39;s Thunderbolt, the one with the highest defense might be the real one...</p>
<p>Yaridovich&#39;s normal attack is him putting his head onto the spear he&#39;s wielding and using it!</p>
<p>Eventually, the doubles merge back into one again!</p>
<p>I use up one turn healing everyone from Yaridovich&#39;s spells!</p>
<p>Bowser and Mario&#39;s attacks seem to vary in damage!</p>
<p>Yaridovich performs his Mirage move again!</p>
<p>I have Mallow Thunderbolt to find the real Yaridovich!</p>
<p>With Mallow as healer, and Mario and Bowser as offense, we finish off Yaridovich!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/pcbgiRK.png alt=victory width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Peach also goes up to level 13, where she learns <strong>Come Back</strong>! I&#39;m guessing this is her <strong>Life</strong> or <strong>Raise</strong> spell. I increase her magic stats!</p>
<p>Geno also gains a level! I boost his physical stats!</p>
<p>Looks like the narration is now aware that Smithy wants the Star Pieces!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/aMRdZOZ.png alt="star pieces want" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>&quot;<strong>What horrible surprises might he have in store for Mario?</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/UV3-Td33-7A>The music&#39;s now changed back to the actual Seaside Town music!</a></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/SVDrv9i.png alt="yarid key" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>While heading back, I notice Yaridovich dropped a key! It&#39;s the key to open the house where the citizens are locked up!</p>
<p>There&#39;s also a note hanging from one of the trees!</p>
<p>I have Mario read it:</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>To Mario,</strong></p>
<p>Knowin&#39; you, it must&#39;ve been a breeze knocking down Yarid, eh? By the way, my pirates say they saw a huge AX flyin&#39; across the sky. It&#39;s probably one of Smithy&#39;s friends. Go get him, pal! Well, my gills are failing on me, so I&#39;ll be headin&#39; back down. Drop in whenever you have time, okay?</p>
<p>Your true mate<br>
Jonathan &quot;Johnny&quot; Jones&quot;</p>
<p>Awwww... <img class=emojione alt=ðŸ™‚ title=:slight_smile: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/1f642.png></p>
<p>I have Mario unlock the house and free the real citizens of the town!</p>
<p>All of the citizens including a mole thank us for rescuing them.</p>
<p>Now the Elder talks to Mario: he mentions his little &quot;torture&quot; from one of Yaridovich&#39;s cronies, but says it&#39;s nothing to worry about...he rewards us with a <strong>Flower Jar!</strong></p>
<p>I admit I spoiled myself earlier in that if I were to continue refusing Yaridovich, he would&#39;ve had the real Elder tickled to the point that if we rescued him, he would have rewarded Mario with just a coin!</p>
<p>I wonder what prize I would&#39;ve won from the real Elder if I handed over the Star Piece immediately?</p>

<p>I head back to the Mushroom Kingdom palace, where a Toad tells me a guest is resting.</p>
<p>Yep, she&#39;s here! It&#39;s her, <strong>Samus Aran!</strong></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/oPncGQw.png alt="samus sleeping" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Samus:</strong> &quot;......I&#39;m resting up for Mother Brain.&quot;</p>
<p>Lucky that&#39;s done, now we go back to Seaside and find out more about the ax flying in the sky...</p>
<p>Too bad I just missed the other cameo in this game...oh well.</p>

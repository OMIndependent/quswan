<p>Now I can see why this place is called the Forest Maze...</p>
<p>There&#39;s so many buzzing Buzzers and spinning Amanitas about in this part of the forest! Arrows are also coming down from the sky...this Smithy gang member really doesn&#39;t want us to find him...</p>
<p>I end up getting lost, and am now back at the save block. Heading back again, I see Geno going right, but I get caught into another battle!</p>
<p>Eeee, the <strong>Sporocyst</strong> from the Amanita turned Mallow into a mushroom!</p>
<p>I try to follow Geno, but he&#39;s too quick for me to keep up!</p>
<p>I&#39;m now back near the save block. I notice the stray Mushroom before the maze and pick it up!</p>
<p>On the third try in the maze, I quickly catch up to the fleeing Geno, and end up in front of log pipes, where someone named <strong>Bow</strong><strong><em>y</em></strong><strong>er</strong>&#39;s counting arrows...I almost misread his name as Bowser.</p>

<p>Mallow notices that that&#39;s the person that&#39;s been shooting arrows at Rose Town...</p>
<p>So that&#39;s one of the Smithy Gang members, and he looks like a bow!</p>
<p>The arrows are his minions!</p>
<p>Mario and Mallow panic!</p>
<p>Mario decides to punch his way through, but Mallow stops him!</p>

<p><strong>Mallow:</strong> &quot;Who do you think you are, Bruce Lee!?&quot; Lol.</p>
<p>But someone&#39;s coming...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Another arrow crony brings Bowyer a green Star Piece.</p>
<p>Bowyer talks like Yoda...</p>
<p>But someone yells in between their conversation...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/FYwy52O.png alt=stop! width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>It&#39;s Geno! He drops down from the treetops and tells Bowyer to give the Star Piece back to him!</p>
<p>Now it&#39;s battle time, with Geno vs. Bowyer!</p>
<p><strong>Geno:</strong> &quot;<strong>I serve... a higher authority...</strong>That Star Piece belongs to everyone. You can&#39;t keep it.&quot;</p>
<p>Angered, Bowyer now fires arrows at Geno...</p>
<p>Mario wants to help Geno. Mallow joins in too, but from a distance...</p>
<p>Mario and Mallow move, as arrows rain down on them!</p>
<p><strong>Mallow:</strong> &quot;<strong>I&#39;m not afraid. And I&#39;m NOT gonna cry!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>But Mallow slips and gets hit by a stray arrow!</p>
<p>Ooooohhhh! Geno hits Bowyer with a sucker punch!</p>
<p>Bowyer retreates, but not before giving Geno a parting arrow...which Mario blocks!</p>
<p>Mallow finally joins in, not happy that Mario left him! </p>
<p>Mallow&#39;s curious as to who Geno is...</p>
<p>Geno recognizes Mario, and says that he and others know about him!</p>
<p>Bowyer is not amused!</p>

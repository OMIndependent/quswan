<p>I struggle a bit making the ascent, since I keep falling back to the Thwomp seesaw room!</p>
<p>A few attempts later, I make it, slowing down a bit and being cautious at this point...</p>
<p>And I jump in surprise at another Fireball trap!</p>
<p>At the second Fireball ambush, Mario&#39;s KO&#39;d!</p>
<p>I switch Mallow for Bowser afterwards.</p>
<p>And another Fireball trap!</p>
<p>The Fireball&#39;s <strong>Mega Drain</strong> is a drain on the entire party...</p>
<p>Casually taking the last coin at the Fireball room, I proceed onward to the west hall.</p>
<p>A stairway filled with Chain Chomps await, barring the way to the top!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/nYTarOO.png alt="chain chomps" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I&#39;m thinking whether to switch back Mallow back to Bowser...hmmm...I decide to keep Mallow for now.</p>
<p>The Chomp&#39;s got solid defense against Geno&#39;s attacks!</p>
<p>Geno&#39;s leveled up! I give him more health!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I jump past the two remaining Chain Chomps, and I&#39;m now in another room...where the sound of Booster&#39;s voice is chugging along.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/jxqgKDk.png alt="booster train" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>He mentions his train as &quot;[his] personal railway.&quot; He sees us!</p>
<p>Booster&#39;s &quot;amazed&quot; at how we made it this far in his tower.</p>
<p>He asks us one question about Peach.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/a4py2i5.png alt="peach q" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Her cries are definitely <strong>not</strong> filled with &quot;happiness&quot;...</p>
<p>Booster then guesses Mario might be &quot;another guy&quot;...and proceeds to pull out a Bob-omb our way, thinking it&#39;s Mario! He pulls out another, then a third!</p>
<p>As the Bob-ombs parachute and light up to detonation, we hide inside an alcove, at a hole where a Booster painting might have been...away from Booster&#39;s line of sight.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/1XMjYf5.png alt=alcove width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>All the Bob-ombs detonate...</p>
<p>Booster is...rather upset, and his train leaves...</p>
<p>We pursue him up the tower, almost getting into a battle with another Chomp!</p>
<p>In the next room, there&#39;s a save block, along with, according to the online guide I read last week, a few chest blocks here...</p>
<p>I get the visible chest block containing the Frog Coin...</p>
<p>...and the other hidden chest block on top of the first one, which has a <strong>Goodie Bag!</strong></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/e392Z7a.png alt="goodie bag get" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I save at this point before heading into the next room...I feel like there might be a boss fight ahead.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>In the next room, I see three, no, four curtains, a birdcage, and a crate of toys...</p>
<p>On top of one of the middle curtains, there&#39;s a doll in the likeness of Mario!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/a9LEbXL.png alt=playroom width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We cross the next passage, and we finally meet up with Peach in the balcony!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/dXTG80a.png alt="peach balcony" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Mario tries to open the door, but it&#39;s locked!</p>
<p>Peach mentions that Booster&#39;s spell is needed to open the door.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Booster&#39;s coming...</p>
<p>Peach tells us to hide and wait until he breaks the spell on the door.</p>
<p>I did spoil myself a bit on this part here in that I might get a very important item if I do this right...</p>
<p>Here comes another minigame!</p>
<p>All I have to do is hide from Booster and his Snifit cronies behind the curtains until he unlocks the door!</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/aHKTklL.png alt="booster enters room" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Booster then asks the Snifits if he should marry Peach...ugh...no no no... <img class=emojione alt=☹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>One of the Snifits suggests that he hold a wedding ceremony, or a party.</p>
<p>Booster doesn&#39;t know what a wedding party is and asks his minions what that is...</p>
<p>A Snifit explains that a wedding party has something to do with drinking punch and eating cake.</p>
<p>Booster thinks it&#39;s too hard to pull one off, but he does it anyway.</p>
<p>Now he and the Snifits start rehearsing for the wedding.</p>
<p>But Booster thinks Mario&#39;s going to ruin the wedding and asks the Snifit to fetch the Mario doll to simulate a Mario interruption! <em><em>gulp</em></em></p>
<p>It&#39;s a pretty tense minigame!</p>
<p>I make it through the first Snifit search!</p>
<p>Two Snifits are now searching! I almost (?) get caught by one of them!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/tTADbKG.png alt="number three" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Oh no!</p>
<p>I get caught by one of them!</p>
<p>Booster notices, but they think it&#39;s a ghost of sorts!</p>
<p>Now it&#39;s two Snifits again!</p>
<p>I manage to get past them again!</p>
<p>Got caught by three Snifits again!</p>
<p>I decide to give myself a second chance at this...</p>
<p>I succeed on the third try! I forgot that I could still run behind the curtains...</p>
<p>Booster thinks the ceremony is better than a party...</p>
<p>Booster then pulls the last curtain, revealing us! <img class=emojione alt=☹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Booster:</strong> &quot;<strong>Wait...a...second!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>He sees the Mario doll above!</p>
<p>Booster says it&#39;s impossible to reach the Mario doll!</p>
<p>He then starts sniffling and is about to sob...the Snifits whisper something in his ear, or probably he&#39;s comforting him...</p>
<p>I&#39;m guessing he knows Mario&#39;s there, he&#39;s probably going to keep up an act.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/oKcP4IE.png alt="waterfall cry" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Or not, as Booster cries waterfalls from his eyes, and the Snifits run in panic!</p>
<p>Mario jumps to knock the doll off the overhang!</p>
<p>Booster thanks Mario for getting his doll (not knowing that&#39;s Mario, lol), and he rewards him with the very important item I was looking for...an <strong>Amulet!</strong></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/jyAkHAt.png alt="amulet get" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Booster:</strong> &quot;May happiness follow you, wherever you go.&quot;</p>
<p>Those are...surprisingly kind words from Booster.</p>
<p>He now stops with the rehearsals, and proceeds with the real thing!</p>
<p>Booster unlocks the door...he doesn&#39;t realize we&#39;re here to rescue Peach...omg! Lol!</p>
<p>The password to open the lock is:
<strong>Mario</strong>.</p>
<p>He opens the door and they go to get Peach...</p>
<p>Snifit 3 takes a second look at Mario and goes off with his boss...I&#39;m thinking Snifit 3 knows that&#39;s Mario, but he didn&#39;t tell Booster!</p>
<p><a name=6></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Before I follow Booster, I save my progress, and try to take the Mario doll...no good.</p>
<p>We pursue him to the balcony!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, two guys, <strong>Knife Guy</strong> and <strong>Grate Guy</strong>, drop down!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/nfHk5bH.png alt="knife guy and grate guy" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Grate Guy&#39;s a jack-in-the-box guy! He also puts one of my party members to sleep too!</p>
<p>After a while, Grate Guy and Knife Guy stack on top of each other. I&#39;m thinking they&#39;re prepping for a Delta or Combo Attack of sorts...</p>
<p>Grate Guy gives us a <strong>Meteor Blast</strong>, while Knife Guy casts Crystal at us!</p>
<p>After several attacks from the party, and a hit from Geno, they topple over!</p>
<p>With combined attacks from Mario, Bowser, and Geno, Knife Guy&#39;s down!</p>
<p>With Mario near-exhaustion, we also take care of Grate Guy...</p>
<p>The trio jump off the balcony, and we get a Flower Jar!</p>
<p>Mario also levels up, learning <strong>Super Flame!</strong></p>
<p>I increase his magical stats!</p>
<p>At the foot of the tower now, and Mario dashes off to chase after Booster!</p>

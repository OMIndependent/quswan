<p>We come across more Undead Sorcerers. Probably they may have caused, or were part of, the illusion...</p>
<p>More crossing, I activate the geotree for this area and use the geoboard to reach the gap I couldn&#39;t get to the first time...</p>
<p>Sliding down the stream...</p>
<p>And a dangerous encounter with Wolf Berserkers ensues! They overpower us, but I manage to escape...</p>
<p>I smash the boulder blocking the north fork before the save point and get the treasures within...</p>
<p>I circle around back to the save point before the cape, fighting a few times.</p>
<p>The therion&#39;s a two-headed dog!</p>
<p>The Therion <strong>Orthrus!</strong></p>
<p>They&#39;re weak to wind, but strong against fire and water!</p>
<p>We corner them, but they unleashes their fiery breath on us!</p>
<p>Velvet recognizes the therion! They&#39;re Orthie and Russ!</p>
<p>Great, they&#39;re now regenerating itself!</p>
<p>The dogs can also do an Elemental Breath among other tricks!</p>
<p>We make it thanks to Laphicet, Eizen, Velvet, and Magilou&#39;s relentless efforts!</p>
<p>Velvet destroys the barrier!</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Sorry, pups. You&#39;re coming with me.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet calms them down.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;I killed their owner. I deserve all their hate, and then some. But not now. Understand? [...] Until then, I need your help.&quot;</p>
<p>Awww, look at the puppies...</p>

<p>The illusion&#39;s now gone...</p>
<p>Phi&#39;s in shock since he found an original copy of the Innominat tome in Velvet&#39;s cabin, and it&#39;s gone!</p>
<p>Eleanor decides that they should go back and find it there.</p>
<p>What a medium fight, but it&#39;s packed with action!</p>
<p>Magilou now knows <strong>Fairy Circle</strong> and we get an <strong>Elemental Attuned Glacite!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Skit: Get The Book</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;That was one hell of an illusion. I have to admire the skill that went into its construction.&quot; You&#39;re telling me.
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;The caster has a tethered malak with a unique power on the same level as my Reaper&#39;s curse.&quot; It must be Melchior who made these illusions.</p>
<p>Eizen sort of confirms it. He doesn&#39;t mention the spellcaster by name...</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Still, we may have a new clue to the nature of Innominat.&quot; He asks if Phi found the original copy of the tome. He did.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a walking code red daemon around the grass before the shrine. I proceed to take care of him as well...</p>
<p>This code red daemon regenerates his health!</p>
<p>We got him on the ropes...</p>
<p>...then he unleashes his powerful spell, Gravity Storm, KO&#39;ing eveyone but Magilou!</p>
<p>Eizen&#39;s on the field now!</p>
<p>The code red only regenerates depending on how much damage we take!</p>
<p>We eventually beat him, though!</p>
<p>I see a Katz Box behind the circle of the ruins, but I don&#39;t have enough spirits to open it...</p>
<p>We make it back to Aball at sunrise.</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;There&#39;s nobody here...&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>This...is reality.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>We return to the ruin again to open the Katz Box now that I have enough spirits. We receive an <strong>invitation!</strong></p>

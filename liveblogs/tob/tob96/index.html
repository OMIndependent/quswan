<p>There&#39;s Grim in the tower.</p>
<p>She explains to us about a &quot;second counting song&quot; in the novel.</p>
<p>Phi reads the song:</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>When the eight malevolences overflow<br>
In the culmination of mankind&#39;s despair<br>
Innominat will bring an end to all peoples<br>
And restore them to time immemorial.</strong></p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Four Empyreans shall wield a wrathful sword<br>
And cleave the great devourer<br>
Two asunder to sleep beneath the earth<br>
As scarlet moonlight illuminates the evil.</strong></p>
<p>&quot;<strong>The nameless Empyrean hath one heart<br>
The nameless Empyrean hath one body.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet implies the song&#39;s referring to how Innominat operates.</p>
<p>Velvet reads the song again.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;So when the world is at peak malevolence, <strong>Innominat will use that power to &#39;bring an end to all,&#39;</strong> is that it?&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s in shock at the revelation! Even Rokurou&#39;s gaping at the thought!</p>
<p>So the Abbey&#39;s true MO is to destroy the world once things get dire and start all over again. Oh my god...</p>
<p>Velvet denies the Shepherd being such a person. But he&#39;s getting there...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;His two primary ideals are &#39;the many over one&#39; and â€˜the restoration of order through will and reason.&#39; He sacrificed Laphi to protect this world, not to eradicate it.&quot;</p>
<p>Well, Velvet&#39;s in for a surprise.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;<strong>People change, Velvet. Perhaps the Shepherd gave up hope. Maybe he lost faith in mankind...</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet wonders why did her brother get sacrificed for?</p>
<p>There&#39;s missing pages in the tome, says Grim.</p>
<p>Rokurou thinks there might be a full &quot;original&quot; copy of the tome.</p>
<p>Only the Abbey knows about the Empyreans.</p>
<p>Phi wonders where the original is...</p>
<p>Everyone decides to sleep on it until morning.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The expedition brought back another treasure: a <strong>Model Craymel Cage!</strong></p>
<p>Since I know very little about <em>Tales of Eternia</em> lore, I decide to not look through the dialogue...</p>
<p>This is the last of the lands to explore...</p>
<p>Outside the docks, Kamoana and Medissa came to see us off!</p>
<p>Kamoana tells us about Medissa! She&#39;s really happy about her! Phi gets embarrassed...</p>
<p>Eleanor quickly changes the subject and tells about Dyle&#39;s new tail, he&#39;s up at the observation tower...she goes there to see it!</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Having some girl trouble, my little malak?&quot;</p>
<p>Phi&#39;s happy that Kamoana and Medissa are happy. So is Eleanor.</p>
<p>Velvet tells Phi about their next task.</p>
<p>Eleanor chastises Velvet for her matter of factness. Velvet says she has to be since they&#39;re dealing with the Abbey.</p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s asking to look for relocation this time.</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s plan is to keep &quot;on the offensive&quot; and find the two therions.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;As a swordsman, I can respect that mindset.&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou says they&#39;re not staying in Titania forever. Velvet knows it too.</p>
<p>Phi finds an earthpulse point in east Eastgand!</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s shocked at where the earthpulse point is!</p>
<p>Eizen decides that <strong>Taliesin</strong>&#39;s our next stop.</p>
<p>Heee...Bienfu&#39;s looking at the seagull...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Skit:</strong> Rokurou points out Grim&#39;s character. She&#39;s honest, but not to the point of bluntness, Rokurou adds. He likes that.</p>
<p>Velvet and the others gets offended by his remarks. Rokurou&#39;s digging himself into a hole again...</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s thinking about the Shepherd pointing out her &quot;lack of composure.&quot; Ignore what the Shepherd says, Eleanor.</p>
<p>Grim&#39;s dependable.</p>
<p>Magilou points out Grim&#39;s fan club has exactly &quot;8,848 members strong!&quot;</p>
<p>She has dinner shows?!</p>
<p>Phi&#39;s awed by Grim&#39;s popularity!</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s also thinking about Grim&#39;s &quot;mannerisms&quot; as benefits. She sighs...</p>
<p>Phi asks if she was doing an impression of Grim. Not intentionally...</p>
<p>Now Magilou eggs her on to do more impressions of Grimoirh.</p>
<p>Eleanor asks Phi about her impression.</p>
<p>The reactions of the party&#39;s faces are priceless!</p>
<p>Phi thinks it&#39;s passable.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Skit:</strong> Phi&#39;s reading one verse of the second song again.</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;No matter how many times I read it, I don&#39;t see any good in it.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor asks if there&#39;s a different meaning for that song. She tries to spin it in a positive way, as in &quot;the end to all&quot; is &quot;the end to all human suffering,&quot; which is no better!</p>
<p>Bienfu points out there might be grammatical errors in that copy...</p>
<p>Rokurou points that out too.</p>
<p><strong>Bienfu:</strong> &quot;I&#39;m an expert at errors!&quot;</p>
<p>Oh Bienfu, he takes up after his master...</p>
<p>More <strong>skits</strong> to slog through: Magilou asks Rokurou and Eizen who won the fishing contest. It&#39;s a draw, according to Eizen. Rokurou&#39;s not letting him have a win. They&#39;re counting points too!</p>
<p>Eizen&#39;s such a competitive sport. No wonder why he&#39;s the challenger at Character Cards...</p>
<p>Rokurou and Eizen decide to have a rematch.</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s made the judge.</p>
<p>Phi asks what contest they&#39;re going to have next other than fishing.</p>
<p>Not cards for Eizen. Not chess for Rokurou, but he does know shogi.</p>
<p>Eleanor suggests arm wrestling. Magilou tosses that one out, as it&#39;s a cause to emit more malevolence...</p>
<p>Velvet suggests &quot;a drinking contest...&quot;</p>
<p>Ooh boy...</p>
<p>Bienfu&#39;s providing snacks!</p>
<p>Eizen then decides to continue his fishing contest against Rokurou. Oh my god, these guys...</p>

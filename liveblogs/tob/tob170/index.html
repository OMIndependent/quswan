<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>After a month of putting this off (offline stuff and all), I&#39;m ready to head up to where Innominat and the Shepherd are...</p>
<p>I repeat the scene with Tabatha in the tavern after taking care of the Dragonfolk (or Rokurou&#39;s mother)...</p>
<p>The party&#39;s at level 64...</p>
<p>I&#39;m still not prepared for this moment...</p>
<p>I almost forgot how vast the steps up to the throne are...</p>
<p>We see a glowing circle before the entrance to the throne...</p>
<p>Everyone&#39;s looking up at the domain way above...</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Huh. Oookay...Well, it&#39;s nice that we&#39;ve tracked down Innominat, but, uh...now what&#39;s the plan?&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;I don&#39;t think even Griffin could get us up there.&quot; No doubt. That place is almost close to outer space...</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;And my Guardian takes up one passenger only.&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen&#39;s smiling. He&#39;s optimistic since he sees a teleportation arte up ahead.</p>
<p>Magilou and I know that we were invited.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;For Innominat to fully awaken, they need me and Laphicet. Which means they want to settle this once and for all too.&quot;<br>
<strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;Sounds good to me! Bring it on!&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou tells Laphicet to &quot;be more cautious!&quot; Laphicet&#39;s jaw drops in shock, and apologizes, looking down.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Wow. That was the first time I&#39;ve heard Magilou say something sensible.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;A bad omen. Let&#39;s be careful, and take a good look around first.&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou quotes Shakespeare. Oh, Magilou...</p>
<p>Everyone&#39;s gathered around the portal...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I check the throne inside. No one&#39;s home.</p>
<p>I go back and talk to Eizen. Velvet&#39;s &quot;validly concerned&quot; about Eizen holding up from the malevolence. Eizen&#39;s not worried about that, but Velvet knows.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;You&#39;ve resigned yourself to becoming a dragon one day, haven&#39;t you?&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Yeah. I&#39;ve long since come to terms with my fate, whether it comes a hundred years from now or mere moments.&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen might turn into a dragon while fighting the Shepherd!? Oh no...</p>
<p>Eizen tells her &quot;to do what [she has] to.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Go in swinging, and the rest will sort itself out.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;I&#39;m glad we were able to join forces with you and Aifread&#39;s pirates.&quot; I agree with that.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;You and I are just two ships who happened to share the same course.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Then I&#39;ll thank the seas and the wind for carrying the reaper into our path.&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen&#39;s grateful for the thanks.</p>
<p>We talk to him again who mentions the portal is a Gate of Travel...</p>
<p>Magilou next.</p>
<p>Magilou&#39;s not running. She&#39;s excited for the final battle...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> (to Magilou) &quot;You know, when we first met, I never would have expected you to stick around this long.&quot;</p>
<p>The feeling is mutual.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;We push on through the trials and tribulations of each and every day, we suffer through hardships and failure, we lose the ones we love, and then we die.&quot; That&#39;s grim.</p>
<p>Velvet brings up a very philosophical question.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Do you think...we were born into this world to suffer?&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Eh.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Uncertainty is what spurs us onward. Forward we move, if only by one step at a time, toward somewhere different than here, through sadness and anger and joy alike. Life is all about that journey.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet notes that she&#39;s saying &quot;sound advice.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Hah! Life&#39;s not all about horribleness.&quot;</p>
<p>I mentioned in a post earlier that Magilou was, in a way, like Drosselmeyer. But now that I look back on that thought, she&#39;s more or less a darker callback to Edel, with some trollish personality.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Eleanor next.</p>
<p>She&#39;s nervous...</p>
<p>Velvet tells her not to be. Eleanor tells her that she can&#39;t be told how to feel.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;You&#39;re always so serious.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;I can&#39;t help it!&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Yeah. You haven&#39;t changed.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;I have so changed! I was once the Abbey&#39;s loyal exorcist, and now I&#39;m about to take on the Shepherd himself...and an Empyrean!&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s not what I meant.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;After all, I&#39;m an awfully serious woman.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Haha... we&#39;re lucky to have you Eleanor.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> (chuckles) &quot;I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s right for the Lord of Calamity to be showing gratitude to an exorcist.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Hey, what good is being the Lord of Calamity if I can&#39;t speak my mind?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;I do what pleases me just as anyone does. I will cast aside neither reason nor feelings...nor will I cast aside hope for an ideal future.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou next.</p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s excited on wanting to face the Shepherd&#39;s fusion!</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Are you ever afraid of anything?&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Of course. I used to be scared of losing a fight. I think that&#39;s why I could never win against Shigure...now all I fear is running away from a fight I might not win. And I was able to make that change traveling with you.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet denies helping him with his character development. But it was &quot;over time&quot; he learned that.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;But still...thanks Velvet.‚Äù</p>
<p>Velvet tells him that &quot;[she] don&#39;t need [his] thanks.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;If anything you should be cursing me. If we lose this...and you&#39;ll get no apology from me.&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> (laughs) &quot;I need an apology as much as you need my thanks. Death comes for everyone. What&#39;s important is that I choose how I live...That&#39;s how I am.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Heh. Yeah...that&#39;s how you&#39;ve always been.&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Damn right. And that&#39;s how I&#39;ll always be.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Let yourself go, get stuck in, and have fun! Let&#39;s enjoy life a little!&quot;</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Now for Laphicet...</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s wanting to talk to him over his namesake, I think? No, it&#39;s about his hair, and why it sticks out.</p>
<p>Then Velvet asks him if he&#39;s drying his hair thoroughly. Oh my god, Velvet...</p>
<p>Laphicet mentions that his hair sticks out all the time.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;I mean, it&#39;s kind of cute, so I guess it&#39;s not a problem.&quot;<br>
<strong>Laphicet:</strong> (grumbles) &quot;I don&#39;t really wanna be called cute.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Then you look handsome with it. I think it suits you.&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet calls the compliment &quot;a little better.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;I never know what to say around Velvet.&quot; Speechless, Laphicet?</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;I&#39;m not afraid of anything. Not when I&#39;m with you, Velvet.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;I can feel him. Innominat is just beyond this arte.&quot;</p>
<p>After a save, we warp!</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We&#39;re way above the earth now...</p>
<p>It looks so silent here. But there&#39;s tons of malakhim monsters about.</p>
<p>The rock music starts playing. I like this track.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;No exorcists here, it looks like.&quot; Yep, the Shepherd and Innominat wanted us to come.</p>
<p>Eleanor spots the malakhim here as well.</p>
<p>Eizen explains about them.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;These malakhim are the Sub Lords who have pacts directly with Innominat. Be careful. He&#39;s likely given them a share of his power.&quot; <strong>Sub Lords!?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;In other words, trouble.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou thinks that knifing their way through is the best idea.</p>
<p>The full name of the place we&#39;re at is <strong>Innominat, Incarnation in the Sky</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Skit: Onward to the Final Battle</strong></p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Our path now leads to the Empyrean Innominat and Artorius. What a strange feeling.&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> (casually) &quot;Yeah, it&#39;s not everyday you make an enemy of the entire world and head out to cut down a god!&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s inner passion in doing this deed surprises her.</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s all smiles, pointing out how Eleanor&#39;s &quot;more stubborn and willful than&quot; the rest of the party.</p>
<p>Eleanor smiles, proud of those labels.</p>
<p>Eizen points out those qualities made her oath with Laphicet.</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s because of you, Eleanor, that I&#39;ve been able to take this voyage around the world. You have my thanks.&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou also points out Laphicet had some character development of his own too. Yay character development!</p>
<p><a name=6></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;It kind of makes me want to give myself a pat on the back.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou chuckles and agrees.</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;Velvet gave me a name, and Eleanor became my vessel. Eizen and Rokurou taught me how to live, and Magilou provided lots of surprises and laughs.&quot; Yep, especially Magilou.</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;All of that made me who I am now, and I&#39;m glad for it.&quot;</p>
<p>Now Bienfu jumps in, asking for his credit for Laphicet&#39;s development.</p>
<p>Laphicet mentions that Bienfu &quot;didn&#39;t do much.&quot; Lol.</p>
<p>Poor Bienfu. Laphicet was joking.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;It seems the enemy&#39;s hate for us has galvanized our spirits.&quot;</p>
<p>Now to face some of the malakhim here...</p>
<p><strong>Bearers of Salvation</strong>, <strong>Birds of Paradise</strong>, <strong>Polar Meteors</strong>, <strong>Robust Seeds</strong> (which look like lampposts), <strong>Angels of Remorse</strong>...</p>
<p>Most of them are weak against non-elemental attacks but they have lots of health to make up for it...</p>
<p>At the other end, I see a big floating glyph and activate it...</p>
<p>...opening up the next area!</p>
<p>After saving in the next area, I check the map...there&#39;s ten different floors in this place!</p>

<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> I did this part before heading to the port to do the Red Crates Job.</p>
<p>On a dare, I decide to face off against the code red daemon!</p>
<p>The code red daemon is an <strong>Orc Kong</strong>! He does look like a clothed King Kong with a fancy axe...</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Look at the size of that axe!&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Watch yourselves. This guy means business!&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;I know, I know! Training isn&#39;t worthwhile if you get killed while doing it.&quot;</p>
<p>We corner the monster...</p>
<p>...until he uses his Break Soul attack: Royal Majesty, bumping the entire party backwards, lowering our defense, and nearly KO&#39;ing us!</p>
<p>I switch the party&#39;s strategy to defense and healing!</p>
<p>This guy&#39;s also quick at spellcasting as well, using Grave on Rokurou!</p>
<p>With me controlling Rokurou, I nearly finish off the code red daemon, until he swings his axe repeatedly again and casts another spell!</p>
<p>I switch to Eizen before reviving Rokurou and landing the final blow!</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;It was a close one. But I am the victor.&quot; Indeed! That was close!</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Another skit</strong> after the battle: Rokurou calls the code red daemon a &quot;pretty strong&quot; opponent. Velvet knows the code red was training for everyone, plus Rokurou&#39;s payment for his &quot;debt&quot; to Velvet.</p>
<p>Eizen asks about the debt Rokurou has to repay. It&#39;s for Velvet helping him find Stormhowl. Rokurou points out again that Stormhowl is his &quot;life.&quot; I hope he doesn&#39;t mean that literally...</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> (smiles) &quot;Also, she broke me free from a 500 year prison sentence.&quot; <strong>500 years!?</strong> What the heck did he do to deserve that sentence!?</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;You say that like it&#39;s an afterthought.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s also the reason why Velvet doesn&#39;t trust Rokurou fully. Velvet&#39;s smart.</p>
<p>But Rokurou points out his clan&#39;s best qualities: &quot;Us Rangetsu men are renowned for out sense of duty and commitment.&quot;</p>
<p>Rangetsu, to Laphicet, Velvet, and Eizen, is an atypical surname.</p>
<p>Eizen knows that the clan uses &quot;unconventional swords and fighting styles.&quot; Interesting...</p>
<p>Rokurou explains that his ancestor came from a distant land, and was taken in by a rich family.</p>
<p>And now, the Rangetsu clan&#39;s well-known for very shadowy jobs, for being &quot;bodyguards, assassins, spies, body doubles...&quot;</p>
<p>And they are super-devoted to their line of work...</p>
<p>Rokurou recites his ancestor&#39;s core saying: &quot;<strong>Always return that which you&#39;ve borrowed even if you must repay it with your life.</strong>&quot; For a laid-back person, he is a traditionalist deep down.</p>
<p>Rokurou then points out that <strong>four</strong> of his five other brothers are dead. <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>It&#39;s only him and this Shigure person that&#39;s left in his clan.</p>
<p>They <strong>really</strong> are super-devoted to their line of work.</p>
<p>Lucky he&#39;s still on our side!</p>
<p>I&#39;m guessing right now this Shigure person must also be honor-bound by the Abbey to serve them...</p>
<p>I also noticed just now the Library menu has a new submenu: <strong>Code Red Hunts.</strong></p>

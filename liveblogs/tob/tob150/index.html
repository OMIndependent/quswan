<p>I geoboard up to the entrance of the Gaiburk Ice Field, then I warp before Meirchio&#39;s east gate...</p>
<p>I climb up the wall to go to the place where we faced off against the Spectral Crystal...</p>
<p>There&#39;s the dragon!</p>
<p>She&#39;s oozing malevolence...</p>
<p>The crew walks to her...</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;She&#39;s hurt, just like they said...&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Is this really how you mean to lift your curse?&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;I&#39;m not the cursed one.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;I&#39;m game.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot;</p>
<p>Then a huge tornado jumps in between the dragon and the crew!</p>
<p>Zaveid!</p>
<p><strong>Zaveid:</strong> &quot;I told you that ain&#39;t happening on my watch!&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;And if you stop me?&quot;<br>
<strong>Zaveid:</strong> &quot;...I&#39;m going to figure out a way to save her!&quot;</p>
<p>He tornadoes Theodora away from the battlefield!</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;If that&#39;s what you want to try, then go ahead. But know that I&#39;m not going to stop.&quot;<br>
<strong>Zaveid:</strong> &quot;Y&#39;know, I just don&#39;t get it! How could a guy like Aifread be friends with someone so hellbent on senseless killing?&quot; You tell me, Zaveid.<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;<strong>Sometimes to kill someone is to save them.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Oh boy...</p>
<p><strong>Zaveid:</strong> &quot;What the hell is going to be saved by being killed? There&#39;s not one damn person in the whole world! No matter what happens, you can&#39;t give up living. That&#39;s my creed!&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen gears up to fight.</p>
<p>Zaveid shrugs, smiling.</p>
<p><strong>Zaveid:</strong> &quot;Guess we&#39;re doing this.&quot;</p>
<p>Even Eleanor can&#39;t believe what&#39;s happening either. They&#39;re both wanting to save Theodora.</p>
<p><strong>Zaveid:</strong> &quot;Sometimes, you just have to fight these things out.&quot;</p>
<p>Here we go!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Zaveid:</strong> &quot;I ain&#39;t holding back, Eizen!&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Good. If you want to stop me, then fight to kill!&quot;</p>
<p>Zaveid has no weaknesses in this round, but he&#39;s strong against earth!</p>
<p>And this guy can guard and attack super fast!</p>
<p>I switch to Velvet!</p>
<p>Zaveid&#39;s quick to recover from a stunned blow too!</p>
<p>Unleash your Mystic Arte, Zaveid! And he does: <strong>Outlaw Barrage!</strong></p>
<p>After a while, almost half of the crew in battle&#39;s KO&#39;d! This guy&#39;s a bit tougher than Milla!</p>
<p>And we all get KO&#39;d!</p>
<p>I make a few adjustments for round 2!</p>
<p>We lay all of our attacks on him this time!</p>
<p>He still gets his chance in to cast his Mystic Arte, though! Twice!</p>
<p>We finally manage to win against Zaveid...</p>
<p>The dragon reappears again, and she breathes a fireball at Laphicet!</p>
<p>Zaveid jumps in!</p>
<p>Rokurou knows she&#39;s still dangerous! As does Magilou!</p>
<p>She throws a counter spell at the dragon, while Zaveid fires at the dragon! She flies away...</p>
<p>Zaveid collapses on to the snow...</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;Zaveid! Are you okay?&quot;<br>
<strong>Zaveid:</strong> &quot;Yeah...I&#39;m not dead yet at least.&quot; By the way he said that he&#39;s taking that a bit too lightly.</p>
<p>Laphicet thanks him for jumping in the way of the dragon&#39;s fireball...</p>
<p>Zaveid thanks him for not getting hurt...</p>
<p><strong>Zaveid:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s right...<strong>nothing would hurt Theodora more than to harm a child.</strong> The thing is even when a child&#39;s lost their parents, their family...even when despair fills their heart...If you hold their hand, they&#39;ll squeeze back. Those hands, frozen from fear and insecurity, will start to feel warmth again. That warmth, a tiny spark deep within, can rekindle their feeling of being alive. Because they possess the determination to keep on living. That&#39;s why Theodora never turned her back, or gave up on, a child. She was more passionate about life than anyone I&#39;ve ever known.&quot;</p>

<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;And that&#39;s why you&#39;re protecting her.&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen knows she&#39;s far too gone already...Zaveid still knows that&#39;s Theodora.</p>
<p><strong>Zaveid:</strong> &quot;And that gives you the right to kill her? You talk like you have such noble intentions, but you&#39;re not fooling anyone! You just want to lift your Reaper&#39;s Curse!&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;I&#39;m not the one who&#39;s cursed.&quot; He&#39;s talking about Theodora.</p>
<p>Here they go again...</p>
<p>Zaveid calls him a coward, and declares that if Eizen ever kills Theodora, it is on!</p>
<p>Eizen stops him with one last thought.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Think about what she taught you about living, and consider what it really means to be alive.&quot;</p>
<p>Everyone walks off, with a bitter-faced Zaveid.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Why does it have to be like this?!&quot; You tell me.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;I get that their creeds mean a lot to them both, but isn&#39;t that all the more reason for them to try to understand each other?&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor brings up a good point. Why not talk and listen?</p>
<p>Laphicet agrees with Eleanor.</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;I don&#39;t want them to fight either. But there&#39;s something else I can&#39;t figure out...&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Is it about why Eizen&#39;s so intent on killing that dragon?&quot;<br>
<strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s part of it...what I can&#39;t figure out is what he means when he says that killing can also save someone.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor should know. She&#39;s been hunting daemons to put them out of their misery...</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;And how he&#39;s not the one with the curse.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Maybe he feels pity for Theodora, and how she&#39;s doomed to keep on living as a dragon.&quot;<br>
<strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;Yeah. What does it really mean to live?&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;This topic sure got deep fast.&quot;</p>
<p>If I could take pics, I would use Eleanor&#39;s last line here as a reaction pic.</p>
<p>We get our rewards for beating Zaveid...</p>
<p>...and we win a <strong>Jacketless Outfit</strong> for Eizen!</p>

<p>After one battle, we make it to the other side!</p>
<p>We climb a long set of vines!</p>
<p>I reach the top! I turn west, where I see a Katz box on the edge of the cliff!</p>
<p>After getting a chest and getting roped into one battle, I jump back down and warp one area down, trying to find the last chest.</p>
<p>I see the final chest from above a bridge, but that passage is hard to get to...</p>
<p>I give up and head into the Vesper Tunnels.</p>
<p>Before heading in, I&#39;m treated to another skit...</p>
<p>Magilou&#39;s thinking of a familiar name.</p>
<p>It&#39;s now Laphicet and Eleanor alone. Laphicet thanks her for what happend earlier. It&#39;s her job to protect people from daemons, but job or not, she&#39;the still save the people anyway.</p>
<p>Velvet steps in, but Magilou found something out! It&#39;s her making another long tale about Stormquell...</p>
<p>In her tale, she calls the sword the God Blade, or is it?</p>
<p>She mentions a blacksmith called <strong>Kurogane</strong>, who wanted to craft a better sword to rival it: <strong>Stormquell</strong>. He tried plenty of times to make a sword worthy of the name Stormquell, but failed...</p>
<p>His grudge against the God Blade, according to Velvet, spans many centuries.</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s right to call it a tall tale, but Magilou tells them to be alert.</p>
<p>Rokurou mentions that the &quot;God Blade&quot; Kurogane wanted to beat was his family&#39;s heirloom: Stormhowl. Oh my god. No wonder why he calls that blade his life.</p>
<p>We&#39;re inside an old mining cave, the <strong>Vester Tunnels</strong>.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>There&#39;s zombies here too, and they&#39;re not like the &quot;friendly&quot; ones in Titania!</p>
<p>There&#39;s also <strong>Armored Centipede</strong>s and a giant <strong>Rock Golem</strong> here too!</p>
<p>I battle some of them to fill up the enemy book.</p>
<p>These Zombies can slow us down with a spell!</p>
<p>The Rock Golems are slow, but are brutally strong, and are weak to artes!</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s animation of breaking the boulder is just putting her fists together and pounding that rock!</p>
<p>Crawling into a hole, I find another passage where I find a <strong>Slow Ward!</strong></p>
<p>Velvet warns Laphicet again not to trust Eleanor, reminding him that malakhim are tools to exorcists. Remembering what the Shepherd said to Eleanor, I would have had my guard up too.</p>
<p>She reminds Laphicet that &quot;[she&#39;s] number one and [Eleanor]&#39;s number two.&quot; I laugh a bit at that sentence.</p>
<p>Laphicet repeats what she said.</p>
<p>Velvet almost says &quot;I&#39;m number one&quot; again, but stops herself. Oh my god, Velvet...hee...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Into the next area, where we fight more Zombies!</p>
<p>The post-battle dialogue with Magilou, Eleanor, and Laphicet&#39;s a bit funny...</p>
<p><strong>Expedition check:</strong> We get a recipe of Freshly Squeezed Normin Carrot Juice!</p>
<p>It seems there&#39;s a code red here in this tunnel too!</p>
<p>Theres a save point here, and another sealed door in front of it...</p>
<p>We head west, where we examine a small column. Velvet notices it&#39;s a candle. Laphicet mentions it&#39;s a ward to keep thieves away. We need to light the candle, and it&#39;ll open the door forward.</p>
<p>But as the game tells us, we might need to light more than one candle to break the door&#39;s seal.</p>
<p>We light the candle here, opening the first door!</p>
<p>I move forward to the center part of the tunnels...</p>
<p>After a battle, Laphicet gets curious on the functionality of her <strong>Assassin&#39;s Creed</strong>-esque blade. Magilou then comes up...poor Laphicet&#39;s in the middle of their banter...</p>
<p>We meet up with the White Turtlez again. He tells us where the port is, beyond more sealed doors!</p>
<p>We check out his wares, he&#39;s got <strong>Peach Gel</strong>s now, meaning this game&#39;s getting serious!</p>
<p>After tons of equipment tinkering and selling, we head out!</p>
<p>We hear a duel going on...is it the Swordbreaker again?</p>
<p>No, someone&#39;s disarmed him!</p>
<p><strong>Oh, there he is!!!</strong></p>
<p><a name=a></a></p>

<p></p><h2 class=entry-title>Tales of Berseria - Part 49a: Ouroboros</h2><p></p>

<p>We break through another boulder north a den of monsters, revealing another crawlspace! I head in.</p>
<p>This is taking us to another code red daemon, huh?</p>
<p>I&#39;m right, it&#39;s a big cobra!</p>
<p>I plan my strategy first before facing off against the code red daemon!</p>
<p>Now I have Velvet as main, I face off against the cobra, or the <strong>Ouroboros!</strong></p>
<p>The monster also has three Armored Centipedes for help!</p>
<p>I should&#39;ve switched out Magilou for Eizen! Dangit!</p>
<p>I get caught by the Ouroboros&#39;s Burly Spin!</p>
<p>I&#39;ve got this guy on the ropes now!</p>
<p>Though he stuns Velvet, we finish him off!</p>

<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>We talk to Eleanor in front of a passable sailing ship. She asks us if the ship&#39;s okay for sailing.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;You&#39;re surprisingly into this.&quot; Ikr?<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Maybe you&#39;ve got a criminal streak in you, after all.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor denies it. Velvet asks Eizen for his input. He gives the ship the okay!</p>
<p>Off to Lionel Island once again!</p>
<p>We make plenty of stop-overs before we meet up with the crew in the middle of the ocean before Endgand.</p>
<p>The ship&#39;s compass is very sturdy.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> (to himself) &quot;If only my inner compass held as steady. From the first moment I laid eyes upon that daemon... I think I knew it was Aifread.&quot; So did I. But Eizen denied that daemon was captain and friend.</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;After all, he taught you that the Reaper&#39;s Curse was part of you. Part of your creed.&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen tells a story about the captain and him being lost at sea for twenty days.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;And all he [said was], &#39;You sure know how to liven up an adventure!&#39;&quot;</p>
<p>Phi considers him &quot;incredible.&quot; Eizen compliments Phi for being Velvet&#39;s moral anchor.</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;Only because you taught me how Eizen.&quot; Awww...</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;&#39;Your wheel is yours to hold&#39;, right?&quot;</p>
<p>And we made it to Lionel Island, where the <em>Van Eltia</em>&#39;s docked!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The pirates didn&#39;t make it!</p>
<p>There&#39;s Kurogane and Benwick KO&#39;d!</p>
<p>Kamoana and Medissa are still alive!</p>
<p>She tells us about the daemon Aifread!</p>
<p>Grim&#39;s also here too. If it wasn&#39;t for Zaveid, the crew would&#39;ve been finished!</p>
<p>Phi&#39;s healing the crew...</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;This is all because I hesitated.&quot;</p>
<p>Zaveid and the daemon Aifread are fighting at the marsh.</p>
<p>One near-conscious pirate&#39;s happy to see Eizen...</p>
<p>Benwick&#39;s still wounded. He knows who the daemon is, but he tries to deny who...</p>
<p>Kurogane&#39;s up, along with Dyle. Kurogane mentions the daemon has &quot;no style at all&quot; in his fighting.</p>
<p>Kamoana&#39;s crying, telling Dyle not to leave her...</p>
<p>One pirate calls that daemon &quot;the meanest foe they&#39;ve ever faced!&quot; </p>
<p>Medissa mentions that the <em>Van Eltia</em> was lured to Lionel Island by a coded message that only Aifread&#39;s crew knows.</p>
<p>I save before heading into the marsh.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>So Zaveid and the daemon are at the second dead end, not where Teresa and Oscar are...</p>
<p>I get into a dangerous encounter...and I manage to survive!</p>
<p>At least the Abbey&#39;s barriers are gone...</p>
<p>I turn around and get some items and equipment from the Turtlez here.</p>
<p>Phi asks if that daemon&#39;s actually Aifread himself. Rokurou thinks Eizen only knows.</p>
<p>Eleanor thinks Aifread&#39;s strong will should&#39;ve prevented him from being fully daemonic. It&#39;s probably because of what Innominat did to him on Hexen Isle...</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> (broods) &quot;Even if you don&#39;t lose yourself, a daemon is a daemon. When you change, you&#39;re no longer human. I don&#39;t remember how I felt as a human, but I bet the human me would&#39;ve thought I&#39;m a real monster.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet wonders if Aifread, if he were human, was obedient to the Abbey.</p>
<p>Magilou doesn&#39;t think so. Knowing Aifread, he&#39;s strong enough to resist malevolence. In Magilou&#39;s opinion, Melchior did something to manipulate Aifread.</p>
<p>Phi&#39;s worried about Aifread and Eizen.</p>
<p><strong>Skit:</strong> Phi tells us to hurry up to go to Zaveid. Rokurou thinks Zaveid will probably &quot;protect Aifread.&quot; He still wants a fight with him...</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:** &quot;He&#39;s a daemon now. He&#39;s not Eizen&#39;s old buddy anymore.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Phi&#39;s still trying to think of a way &quot;to make him...himself again.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s resigned to Aifread&#39;s fate.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;The old Aifread&#39;s gone.&quot;</p>
<p>As for how Eizen&#39;s going to take him on... <img class=emojione alt=☹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s expecting a fight with the daemon Aifread. He tells Phi to prepare for that outcome...Phi&#39;s still looking for alternatives...</p>
<p>On the way, I get more treasures such as a <strong>Con Fuoco</strong> for Eleanor, and a <strong>Francois Rabelais Sash</strong> for Velvet!</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>There&#39;s Zaveid and Aifread!</p>
<p>Rokurou asks how Zaveid is.</p>
<p><strong>Zaveid:</strong> &quot;Stop. I know these fists. This is Aifread.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Why didn&#39;t you fight back?&quot;<br>
<strong>Zaveid:</strong> &quot;...He pulled me back from the brink. I owe him. This time, it&#39;s my turn to bring him back.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;A daemon can never be human again.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet looks away, at Phi.</p>
<p>Zaveid don&#39;t care.</p>
<p><strong>Zaveid:</strong> &quot;So what? That supposed to make me change my creed? What do you think, Aifread?&quot;</p>
<p>Before Zaveid could power up, Aifread shoves him away!</p>
<p>Zaveid lunges at Phi, his fist flaming!</p>
<p>Eizen stops him!</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Benwick and crew risked their lives by your side. Zaveid [...] stands by his beliefs. I won&#39;t let anyone trample their creeds [...] even you!&quot;</p>
<p>Aifread uses Siegfried to power himself up!</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;I owe you everything, Aifread. <strong>And now, it&#39;s time to pay it back.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>The fight is on!</p>
<p>Velvet asks Eizen about Aifread. He&#39;s fine.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;He&#39;s a sturdy birdie!&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Damn right he is! And that&#39;s why I&#39;ve gotta do this!&quot;</p>
<p>After cutting his health down below half, Aifread unleashes his Mystic Arte: <strong>Bone Skewer!</strong></p>
<p>Now we finish Aifread off. I wish I finished him off with Rangetsu Heron, though...the conditions to activate that move are super tricky...</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;End of the road.&quot;</p>
<p>Aifread charges again! Eizen tries to hold him, but no good!</p>
<p>Aifread&#39;s still focused on his given task to take care of Laphicet! He now has him! No... <img class=emojione alt=☹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Taking hostages now?&quot;</p>
<p>Phi apologizes and tells everyone to leave him!</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;I&#39;m prepared for whatever happens!&quot; No...</p>
<p>Eizen accepts it. He flips his coin.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;You&#39;re grown. You&#39;re a man now. Family, friends, everything I ever tried to hold onto...All of it trickled away, fell from my grasp...But [someone] once told me, &#39;If you can&#39;t hold something in your hand, then make a fist and take it by force!&#39; <strong>This fist will take everything back! Just like you told me to!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen charges! Phi headbutts Aifread and punches Aifread in the gut!</p>
<p><strong>Aifread:</strong> &quot;<strong>I know this fist...it&#39;s you...Sorry...caused you a lot of trouble, didn&#39;t I?</strong>&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it. We&#39;re friends right?&quot;</p>
<p>He&#39;s about to fall, but Eizen stops him.</p>
<p>Phi unleashes his flames! <strong>Aifread&#39;s cured of daemonblight!</strong></p>
<p>Magilou and the rest of the party can&#39;t believe what Laphicet just did!</p>
<p>He heals Aifread.</p>
<p><strong>Aifread:</strong> &quot;Forget it. It&#39;s too late.&quot;<br>
<strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;I&#39;m sorry...if I only knew...how to use my power...&quot;</p>
<p><a name=6></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Phi heals Aifread again...</p>
<p>Phi can&#39;t believe Aifread&#39;s gone...</p>
<p>And Eizen and the crew looked for him for over a year too...</p>
<p>Aifread points out Eizen being &quot;soft.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Aifread:</strong> (to Phi) &quot;I&#39;ll let you in on a little secret...your power comes from being part of Innominat.&quot; Already knew that.</p>
<p><strong>Aifread:</strong> &quot;...<strong>If you can seal off his domain, you actually got a chance of putting up a good fight...the four elemental Empyreans, sleeping in the earthpulses...If you can rouse them from their slumber...</strong> Hurry...<strong>the Shepherd and Innominat are getting ready for some &#39;Ceremony of Suppression&#39;.</strong> It&#39;s now or never, kid. I&#39;m just sad I can&#39;t go with you...it sounds like a <strong>goddamn</strong> blast...&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;I won&#39;t apologize.&quot;</p>
<p>Aifread puts his fist to Eizen&#39;s chest.</p>
<p><strong>Aifread:</strong> &quot;<strong>You shouldn&#39;t. I&#39;m grateful. You always kept things from gettin&#39; dull. If we ever meet again...</strong> <strong><em>let&#39;s raise some hell...Eizen.</em></strong>&quot;</p>
<p>He&#39;s gone.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;<strong>Yeah, we will. See you, Aifread.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>He was too awesome for this game...<strong>why?</strong></p>
<p>Zaveid&#39;s up, and walks away.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;I owe you one, Zaveid.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Zaveid:</strong> &quot;We had a chance to bring him back. But you went and killed him...next time I see you, <strong>we&#39;ll settle the score. Between me and your &#39;creed&#39;.</strong>&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;See you around, Zaveid.&quot;</p>
<p>We get a <strong>Bottomless Denore Bottle!</strong></p>
<p>Back at the docks...</p>
<p>Now our next move is open to us: <strong>awaken the four Empyreans.</strong> But how to do it?</p>
<p>Magilou suggests &quot;tickling their divine footsies with a feather.&quot;</p>
<p>Benwick knocks them both out! He asks what happened to the horned daemon...</p>
<p>Eizen explains. He then orders the crew to get Grim and get info from her about the four Empyreans...</p>
<p>He escorts Benwick out.</p>
<p>Phi asks Eizen if he&#39;s sure he wants to go with this. Eizen says yes.</p>

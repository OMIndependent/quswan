<p>My goodness, the temple and the surrounding scenery itself is another pic-worthy scene.</p>
<p>I save before heading in.</p>
<p>At the entrance doors, there&#39;s a lot of KO&#39;d exorcists...</p>
<p>There&#39;s a noise beyond the doors!</p>
<p>And someone&#39;s yelling!</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;A daemon!&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;The daemon we heard about? Sounds like it&#39;s having fun.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet decides to go in!</p>
<p><strong>Skit:</strong> Laphicet&#39;s amazed at the temple! Magilou explains like the Yvolg Ruins, Palamedes Temple was built in the same fashion: underwater.</p>
<p>Laphicet knows that &quot;it couldn&#39;t have been easy&quot; to build an underwater temple.</p>
<p>Eizen notes that too.</p>
<p>Rokurou wonders how the temple builders did it. Eizen explains it. Rokurou grins at the thought of the building process.</p>
<p>Eleanor brings up more info: this temple used to sit on the coast, according to the &quot;official&quot; records. She explains that the &quot;temple was swallowed by the sea&quot; the moment the Empyreans slept.</p>
<p>So another building crew made a tunnel connecting to the temple.</p>
<p>The info&#39;s from <em>The Revised Theories of Ancient Architecture</em>. Laphicet read that book. Eizen &quot;read the first edition.&quot; Oops...</p>
<p>Eleanor talks plenty fast at this point. There&#39;s many different &quot;competing theories&quot; as to how the temple was built.</p>
<p>Rokurou asks if she was actually debunking what Eizen read. She didn&#39;t mean to do that...</p>
<p>Eizen&#39;s gloomy...</p>
<p>Velvet, as usual, don&#39;t care.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>As we head down the stairs to the temple, I play <strong>another skit:</strong> Velvet asks Eizen if &quot;there&#39;s no Empyrean&quot; in the temple. Magilou asks her to ask Eizen to flip the reaper coin. Rokurou points out &quot;it always comes up tails.&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen insists the temples are just &quot;places of worship built by human hands.&quot; He says that Empyreans sleeping in the temple are only &quot;legend.&quot;</p>
<p>But there&#39;s Innominat. Eizen&#39;s still skeptical, saying Innominat&#39;s &quot;a special case.&quot;</p>
<p>The dark blue stone and blue lights capture the scenery of this temple very well.</p>
<p>At the foot of the stairs are soldiers and more enemies!</p>
<p>We face off against five <strong>Spearmen</strong> first!</p>
<p>Then another wall monster, the <strong>Deep Barrier!</strong></p>
<p>We climb down more stairs to another chamber filled with waterfalls.</p>
<p>The doors behind them are locked...</p>
<p>There&#39;s a monolith in the middle. I read the writing there:</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>The chalice bears a symbol and that commands flowing water.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Should the chalice be filled with water and its mark turned blue, the water shall be as a wall to thwart your path.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Should the chalice be dried by flame and its mark turned white, the impeding waters shall lie still, opening the path before you.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>This <strong>is</strong> a puzzle...</p>
<p>I climb down another large set of stairs, to where the chalice is on a dais...</p>
<p>There&#39;s even lizard monsters here...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I check the pedestal below the chalice. What am I supposed to put in the relief here, though?</p>
<p>I head to the east wing and slide the doors open there. There&#39;s another chalice with a gem lodged in its pedestal.</p>
<p>I turn the gem red, drying up the chalice here.</p>
<p>I&#39;m now given a tutorial on the temple&#39;s chalice waterfall system.</p>
<p>The lizard daemons are priests!</p>
<p>The east path upstairs is now open!</p>
<p>Nothing but Katz spirits and simple treasure here.</p>
<p>In the west chalice room now, there&#39;s a cracked wall behind the pedestal.</p>
<p>I turn off the waterfall for the west door upstairs...</p>
<p>While heading back up, I read the updated synopsis of the game so far: it seems from what we&#39;ve learned, therions absorb malevolence. From what I&#39;ve seen with Velvet so far, after Velvet finishes off a human-turned-daemon, they turn back into a human...</p>
<p>Could she have absorbed the &quot;malevolence&quot;?</p>
<p>Could this &quot;malevolence&quot; be daemonblight?</p>
<p>There&#39;s a teardrop embedded on a monolith, and a warp point to the right...</p>
<p>I take the warp to another part of the ruin...</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the way forward is blocked by a waterfall.</p>
<p>I warp back down and take out the <strong>Teardrop-Shaped Gemstone</strong> from the monolith.</p>
<p>I head down and place the gem on the empty recess of the center chalice&#39;s pedestal...</p>
<p>I dry up the center waterfall. Now we can move forward!</p>
<p>This dungeon sort of feels like a <strong>Zelda</strong>-themed temple.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>In the next area, we see a daemon!</p>
<p>The daemon, Magilou notices, is wearing the crest of Amenoch...this must be a priestess.</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;Then that makes this daemon...!&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Yeah. She must be the missing mother Mahina.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s in shock again.</p>
<p>No other choice...</p>
<p>I switch to Velvet for this battle!</p>
<p>Velvet tells Eleanor not to get distracted!</p>
<p>The Daemon Mahina doesn&#39;t have any weaknesses, but she&#39;s strong against non-elemental attacks.</p>
<p>I finish her off with a Mystic Arte!</p>
<p>Her breathing&#39;s shallow now...</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;To think a priestess beloved by her village would become a daemon...she&#39;s never going to be the same again. This is the least I can do for her...&quot; <img class=emojione alt=â˜¹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png> No...</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;<strong>So says reason!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Another drop of water! Laphicet senses something again!</p>
<p>Mahina roars and runs away!</p>
<p>Velvet decides to leave her alone. Eleanor stands there.</p>
<p>To the next door, there&#39;s five passages, with two on the east and west, and one in the center. The center passage, though, is locked...</p>
<p>Seeing a save point nearby, I stop here for now.</p>

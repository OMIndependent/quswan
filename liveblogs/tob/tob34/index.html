<p>Back to the woman in black. She gives us mabo curry and peach pie (N <em>Gnyrf bs Erovegu</em> ersrerapr, V guvax?) as lunch rewards.</p>
<p>Velvet wastes no time. She wants info now.</p>
<p>The woman in black tells us about the <strong>Empyrean&#39;s Throne</strong>, the new Abbey HQ up north. The Shepherd&#39;s staying there for awhile. She also says that the Abbey&#39;s doing a ritual to move Innominat&#39;s seat from the cathedral to the temple.</p>
<p>Every important figure in the Abbey&#39;s heading there too...Rokurou knows he&#39;ll find Shigure there as well.</p>
<p>But, as with very important events, security is also very high.</p>
<p>Velvet says they&#39;ll manage. Nope. There&#39;s also an arte-built barrier up as well. But how can the exorcists manage to get in? Velvet thinks the exorcists have a key to get in...</p>
<p>One of the Bloodwings are scouting for information concering that, but to get in, there&#39;s another price.</p>
<p>The woman in black hands us &quot;the bill.&quot; We have to assassinate High Priest Gideon. Holy heck... <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Rokurou smiles, arms crossed at the idea.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Okay, now we&#39;re <strong>REALLY</strong> not being nice.&quot; Oh yeah, we&#39;re being sinful...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Consider it done.&quot;</p>
<p>The woman in black asks Velvet why she&#39;s not asking why she has to assassinate a VIP like a high priest...</p>
<p>Velvet closes her eyes, and guesses he&#39;s been smuggling Nectar...looks like this high priest isn&#39;t as pure as we thought. He&#39;s, in a way, a smuggler.</p>
<p>Velvet confirms it. Holy heck, this is deep. This is so deep...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;The church is the sole producer and distributor of a highly addictive substance. They rake in huge profits while the common man along with you suffer for it...&quot;</p>
<p>The woman in black is impressed.</p>
<p>So we are liberating people from a corrupt organization...</p>
<p>Velvet passes the Bloodwings&#39; test.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Woman in black:</strong> &quot;No matter how skilled you are, you have to know more than how to swing a sword to earn my trust.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet reaffirms that she will do anything to get revenge for her brother...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;I [tossed] my scabbard long ago.&quot;<br>
<strong>Woman in black:</strong> (closes eyes) &quot;I see. So you are an embodiment of a bare blade. <strong>A more formal introduction is in order. I am Tabatha Baskerville, leader of the Bloodwing Butterflies.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet introduces herself to Tabatha. She asks her more about the high priest Gideon.</p>
<p>Tabatha delivers: High Priest Gideon prays every evening at the royal villa, alone, as per tradition. The best opportunity to strike...</p>
<p>To get in the villa, Tabatha gives us a writing pad with a peculiar insignia. So we need the Bloodwings&#39; help for this one...</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s stressed out now...</p>
<p>Laphicet asks if she&#39;s okay...purple flames blow behind her. It seems she&#39;s hungry, I think. But she waves it off as nothing, wanting to be left alone.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Sneaking into the castle will be an all-night job.&quot;</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Skit:</strong> Laphicet asks why the Cathedral&#39;s making Nectar if it&#39;s illegal. Rokurou gives a good point. There&#39;s going to be people who will skirt around the rules for some ulterior motive...</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Just because the powers-that-be say a rule is for the greater good, it doesn&#39;t mean that everyone will see eye-to-eye with them.&quot;</p>
<p>He brings up the thought of mabo curry being banned as an example. Oh, Rokurou...</p>
<p>Eizen points out that illegal things become rare, which means huge profit for people selling illegal stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;The world isn&#39;t a simple place. There&#39;s an underside to everything.&quot; Hear, hear...</p>
<p>Eizen lists the types of &quot;underside&quot; occupations. Pirates like him fit the bill.</p>
<p>Rokurou lists &quot;dyeing chicks blue,&quot; and &quot;alleyway bug fights&quot; as &quot;underside&quot; jobs.</p>
<p>Laphicet asks about what kind of bugs fight. Rokurou&#39;s face, lol...</p>

<p>I wander around town a bit afterwards...</p>
<p>I hope we don&#39;t kill any Empyreans, though.</p>

<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>I&#39;m up to the last part of the cave! After burning more vines and picking up a stray Bronze Scrap, we head down into another part of the cave, where we find a warp point back to the start!</p>
<p>After selling more stuff and saving again, I finish off the last part of the cavern!</p>
<p>Along the way, we find a gold chest containing a <strong>Mercury Satchel!</strong></p>
<p>Fighting more monsters now...</p>
<p>We see the end of the tunnel!</p>
<p><strong>Skit:</strong> Eizen&#39;s flipping his coin. It lands on tails again.</p>
<p>Velvet points out his superstitiousness.</p>
<p>Rokurou asks where the coin came from.</p>
<p>Eizen says it&#39;s not a grim reaper, but the &quot;demon king Dhaos.&quot; So I am right, that means the other side&#39;s the Goddess Martel. Rokurou notes he heard that name Dhaos somewhere before...</p>
<p>The malak child confirmed my thoughts. It is <strong>Martel</strong> and <strong>Dhaos</strong> on the coin.</p>
<p>He cites the <strong>Book of Ragnarok</strong>, and its chapter as well. The chapters called &quot;The Battle of Yggdrasill.&quot; So <strong>Symphonia</strong> (naq Cunagnfvn, gb na rkgrag, V guvax) is now considered ancient lore in this game, huh?</p>
<p>Eizen mentions the coin was found from ancient ruins called Kharlan. Derris-Kharlan?</p>
<p>It&#39;s a really rare coin...</p>
<p>I wonder if <strong>Vesperia</strong>&#39;s also part of this game&#39;s lore as well?</p>
<p>The malak child mentions that there were a lot of books in his former master&#39;s chamber. So he read that book a few times. And I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s probably a long tome, since it has more than 765 chapters...</p>
<p>Velvet asks where Eizen got the coin. Long story. As usual.</p>
<p>Eizen&#39;s not supposed to talk about the meaning of the coin.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We&#39;re now at the <strong>Burnack Plateau, the Great Junction.</strong></p>
<p>What a wonderful view!</p>
<p>And to the east is that impregnable fortress.</p>
<p>I quick save here before heading down the cliffs...</p>
<p>So the quick save overwrites the old quick save, huh?</p>
<p>Eeee, there&#39;s a daemon called a <strong>Maul</strong>, and it&#39;s not the prettiest sight...the monster gave me a bit of a scare when I encountered it!</p>
<p>The gate before the fortress looks empty.</p>
<p>A leaf blows into a blurry barrier, singed the moment it touches the barrier.</p>
<p>Eizen didn&#39;t expect this...</p>
<p>Looks like Midgand&#39;s beefed up security now...</p>
<p>Velvet points out that Eizen&#39;s bad luck might&#39;ve had somethinng to do with it.
This isn&#39;t the worst of it, Eizen says.</p>
<p>We decide to take the construction entrance downhill...</p>
<p>After fighting some <strong>Wolves</strong>, we check the east gate. It&#39;s guarded heavily.</p>
<p>It was built alongside the fortress for extra security, says Eizen. Midgand wasted no expense on its defenses.</p>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/cz7WflYqArQ>Before I forget, here&#39;s the music for Burnack Plateau.</a></p>
<p>We head down the narrow precipice, and an even narrower land bridge. If only I could take pics in this game...the plateau looks beautiful...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>That&#39;s a long way down...</p>
<p>...and there&#39;s also guards patrolling the entrance...</p>
<p>The malak child and Eizen tell them to be careful!</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;They&#39;re not what they seem!&quot; He&#39;s right. They&#39;ve turned into daemons, <strong>Lizardmen!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;What kind of curse is this, Eizen?&quot;</p>
<p>We take care of them...</p>
<p>Rokurou also asks if this is Eizen&#39;s curse at work here.</p>
<p>Velvet thanks him for stopping her. But, it was the malak child who noticed. Are they going to give him a name now?</p>
<p>He looks down.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;In that case, I&#39;ll be counting on you to keep watch. After all, we&#39;ve got a reaper with us. Who knows what else we&#39;ll find.&quot; Or what the Abbey&#39;s hidden...</p>
<p>Rokurou reassures the malak child it&#39;s okay to talk.</p>
<p>My goodness! More surprises come in the form of plant monsters called <strong>Plantus!</strong></p>
<p>After saving, we head in the gate.</p>

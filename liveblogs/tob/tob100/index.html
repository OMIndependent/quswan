<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>This is the first playthrough where I&#39;ve reached part 100!! What a long game this is!</p>
<p>Oh my god, everyone in the village is alright! What&#39;s happening here?</p>
<p>Everyone&#39;s overjoyed at seeing Velvet return to Aball!</p>
<p>They still thank the Shepherd for saving the village!</p>
<p>Velvet points out what he actually did: he sacrificed Velvet&#39;s brother.</p>
<p>All the villagers shake their heads.</p>
<p>Velvet is not happy.</p>
<p><strong>Niko:</strong> &quot;<strong>What counts is that your brother&#39;s still alive.</strong>&quot; <strong>What!?</strong> Hang on...</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s in shock at this news.</p>
<p><strong>Niko:</strong> &quot;He&#39;s in your house. Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ve all pitched in to take care of him.&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen&#39;s still pondering.</p>
<p>Phi suggests going to Velvet&#39;s old cabin.</p>
<p>Oh my god, it&#39;s been almost two months on-again, off-again (at the time I played this part) since I made it back to Aball...</p>
<p>The cat Othellina&#39;s now a mother! She has a daughter called Othellinina!</p>
<p>The traveling merchant here has plenty of Topaz and Quartz equipment...</p>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/FVVh7kUSVTw>Here&#39;s the music for the village of Aball</a>.</p>
<p>After tons of transactions and equipment changes, I head to the gate to Tranquil Woods. The villager guarding it says that the rains caused &quot;a lot of landslides.&quot;</p>
<p>Our expedition&#39;s returned with a <strong>Royal Crown!</strong> I put it on Velvet...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Velvet&#39;s still trying to process everything that&#39;s happened.</p>
<p>Phi asks &quot;what&#39;s wrong&quot;...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/5lpcjXe.png alt="eizen slugs rokurou" width=480 height=270 id=hd-liveblog></p>
<p>...and Eizen slugs Rokurou out of the blue!</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Well, that didn&#39;t break it.&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Next time you suspect an illusory arte, test out your theory for yourself.&quot;<br>
<strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;You think we&#39;re all seeing an illusion?&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen assumes so.</p>
<p>Eleanor thinks putting an illusion on a village isn&#39;t possible. With the Abbey, you may never know...</p>
<p>Magilou says it also shouldn&#39;t be.</p>
<p>Rokurou asks how they could break the illusion.</p>
<p>Eizen and Rokurou split up to find the therion. Phi&#39;s going off with Velvet. Eleanor and Magilou join Phi...</p>
<p>We make it to Velvet&#39;s old cabin. Oh god...I&#39;m nervous...</p>
<p>Nothing&#39;s changed at all.</p>
<p>Phi tells Velvet to keep her guard up.</p>
<p>Velvet starts yelling at him!</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;You could think it could be Melchior&#39;s doing. But even so....&quot; It&#39;s possible. That man&#39;s very powerful.</p>
<p>Oh my god, her hand! Phi heals her hand immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;<strong>People can fight against pain. But...</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Inside the house now...</p>
<p>Ah! It&#39;s Laphi! He&#39;s alive! <strong>What&#39;s going on!?</strong></p>
<p>She goes to her brother. She touches his cheek...she can&#39;t believe it...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;You&#39;re warm...<strong>Laphi... you&#39;re really alive...</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>But he&#39;s in a coma.</p>
<p><strong>Niko:</strong> &quot;He&#39;s been asleep. Ever since that day. I found him at the shrine collapsed on the ground. His wounds healed, but he&#39;s never woken up...&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;If he&#39;s still alive...that&#39;s all that matters.&quot;</p>
<p>She looks at the comb he gave her.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;I&#39;ll find a way to wake you again, Laphi... I swear I will. We&#39;ll be together. I still have to thank you for this comb after all...&quot; No...</p>
<p>Phi realizes where she got that comb.</p>
<p>Magilou and Niko leave the room.</p>
<p>Man, that was intense...</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s now thinking...</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Did [the Shepherd] really try to sacrifice [Velvet&#39;s brother]?&quot;</p>
<p>Phi&#39;s worried. Magilou notices. He hides it and says he&#39;s happy that Velvet&#39;s happy.</p>
<p>Niko notices Phi&#39;s name and calls that &quot;coincidence.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet sounds so different...so <strong>happy...</strong></p>
<p>Eleanor asks what their next move is.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Niko suggests Velvet make soup.</p>
<p>This feels like the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus-eaters>Lotus Eaters</a> all over again.</p>
<p>Phi pitches in as Velvet&#39;s &quot;taste tester.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Skit:</strong> Eleanor wonders about Eizen&#39;s and Rokurou&#39;s progress. Phi still wants to watch Velvet. He throws in that infamous George Lucas line again. That&#39;s the third time (counting my <strong>Mana</strong> playthrough) that I&#39;ve read or heard that.</p>
<p>Eleanor and Phi decide to stay with Velvet. As for Magilou, &quot;whatever [she] feels like!&quot; Oh, Magilou.</p>
<p>Phi thanks her.</p>
<p><strong>Bienfu:</strong> &quot;Are you sure you&#39;re doing the right thing?&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;In the end, whatever happens, happens. Wiser words never spoken, right?&quot;</p>
<p>She knows this is an illusion.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;All right, first I&#39;m going to whip up my special quiche. And then I&#39;ll throw in tomato, and egg soup, and some pudding!&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;I didn&#39;t even know your face <strong>had</strong> smile-muscles.&quot;</p>
<p>There&#39;s a Katz box on the left side near the cabin. I can&#39;t open that one.</p>
<p>I speak with the villagers. One villager mentions that Laphi talks sleeping, saying, &quot;Please be safe, Sis.&quot;</p>
<p>Everyone&#39;s grown too...</p>
<p>The man in the fence apologizes to Velvet for him insulting the Shepherd. The young man next to him regrets his doubt about him too. What&#39;s going on here? Leave the village? Velvet didn&#39;t leave...she got taken away...</p>
<p>They tell her that they&#39;re there if she needs them.</p>
<p>One villager compliments Velvet as &quot;tougher and more reliable.&quot;</p>
<p>The pregnant mother has another baby, and she&#39;s getting married!</p>
<p>The village elder praises the malakhim becoming visible to humans...Velvet asks the elder to be her escort. Nope. She advises us to be careful hunting prickleboars. She notes Velvet&#39;s sixteen. Wrong.</p>
<p>Eleanor sees an inconsistency here. The elder&#39;s off on Velvets age by three years, as usual.</p>
<p>The elder tells Velvet to not lose hope. Velvet thanks her.</p>
<p><strong>What the heck is going on?</strong></p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The young guy asks about Niko. Velvet says she met her already, and asks about the dogs Orthie and Russ.</p>
<p>The youth mentions &quot;a guy with a big sword walking with a dour-eyed fellow in black.&quot;</p>
<p>He means Rokurou and Eizen.</p>
<p>Rokurou points out the village looks peaceful &quot;at a glance.&quot;</p>
<p>The shop owner and his wife tell us everything in Aball&#39;s changed. In what way?</p>
<p>No speck of malevolence anywhere. What&#39;s going on?</p>
<p>Velvet asks the general store salesman for ingredients, she gets it free of charge.</p>
<p>Eleanor doesn&#39;t like spinach.</p>
<p>The general store guy calls Velvet &quot;special&quot; for making friends with an exorcist.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet &amp; Eleanor:</strong> &quot;<strong>She&#39;s not my friend!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet asks for prickleboar, nothing in stock. The general store guy suggests going to Morgana instead of the Tranquil Woods for prickleboars.</p>
<p><strong>Skit:</strong> Now Phi knows Eleanor&#39;s not a fan of spinach! Phi&#39;s smiling at Velvet smiling. Eleanor also praises Velvet for being wise with her budget while picking out good ingredients.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;She seemed so cheerful and carefree.&quot;<br>
<strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;<strong>That&#39;s the real Velvet. I&#39;m sure of it.</strong>&quot; So do I.</p>
<p>Phi wishes she stayed like that. I know...</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;She could&#39;ve lived a happy life, surrounded by her friends...&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Just plain Velvet Crowe, sister to [the Shepherd]...&quot;<br>
<strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;...And maybe not [the Shepherd], but just plain Arthur.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s romanticizing in the illusion, and of what Velvet could&#39;ve been. Phi smiles.</p>
<p>Now off to Morgana Woods...</p>

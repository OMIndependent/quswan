<p>Now to head off to the Tranquil Woods to hunt those Prickleboars!</p>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/FVVh7kUSVTw>Here&#39;s the music for Aball Village.</a></p>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/dQ9pnbZBZVI>Along with the music for the Autumn-colored Forest, the Tranquil Woods.</a></p>
<p>I still can&#39;t take pics yet! Boooooo!</p>
<p>I check the map, it seems like there are three stars on the map, three Prickleboars Velvet needs to hunt...</p>
<p>Not much chests to look for as I have Velvet try to go up a small creek. No good.</p>
<p>As we head north, Velvet surveys the area, saying that it looks promising...</p>
<p>I pick up a Comfrey on the ground. It&#39;s used for medicine sometimes.</p>
<p>Two turns east, and we encounter our first battle: with two Prickleboars!</p>
<p>Now I&#39;m guided on a tutorial, the battle music, as per usual, sounds blood-pumping...</p>
<p>Velvet has a limited amount of energy she can spend on attacking...</p>
<p>I&#39;m now told I can get &quot;souls,&quot; which allows me to get more combos.</p>
<p>Like the <em>Tales</em> games I&#39;ve played before, I can switch targets holding the R1 button and moving the cursor to the direction of the next enemy.</p>
<p>At the end of the battle, I get <strong>Prickleboar Meat!</strong></p>
<p>I have Velvet pick up a Lingzhi Mushroom, another ingredient for medicine...</p>
<p>Another skit now, where Velvet thinks of different names for Prickleboar hybrids in case the villagers try to breed them with other pigs. She settles for &quot;piggleboars&quot; after she rejects &quot;oinkleboars.&quot;</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>After going into a small tunnel, at the other end, we see more prey!</p>
<p>With another chest with an Apple Gel inside!</p>
<p>So the five diamonds above Velvet&#39;s display is a <strong>Soul Gauge</strong>...</p>
<p>Velvet recites her teacher&#39;s second maxim: &quot;<strong>Know your foes, and strike when they&#39;re weak!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>More explanations about the Soul Gauge...</p>
<p>There&#39;s another save point in between the crossroads.</p>
<p>The north path, however, is blocked by a huge boulder!</p>
<p>After saving, we take the eastern way, up an incline to the cape...I hear seagulls cawing...the last Prickleboar&#39;s there, along with large ruins.</p>
<p>The view of the sea and the area here looks so vast and beautiful. I wish I could take a screenshot of this...</p>
<p>I&#39;m guessing the ruins before Velvet are ruins of the shrine of tranquility...I&#39;d better avoid that.</p>
<p>I take care of the last of the Prickleboars, and head back.</p>
<p>The obstacles here (the deep canyon, the cracked boulder at the north road) might mean that I&#39;ll come back to this place later...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>As we head back to the largest area in the woods, a fleet of Prickleboars stop us!</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s thinking the same thing I am: it seems like we hunted their family... <img class=emojione alt=â˜¹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>But Velvet persists.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Maxim three: &#39;<strong>Never waver once your sword is drawn. Control your feelings to control the tide of battle!</strong>&#39;&quot;</p>
<p>The battle begins!</p>
<p>The tutorial teaches me about <strong>Hidden Artes</strong>, since these enemies are Beast-types, and Beast-types are weak against artes like <strong>Searing Edge</strong>, I can use that arte...</p>
<p><strong>Searing Edge</strong> is a fire-type arte...</p>
<p>As Velvet takes care of the Prickleboars, something happens to one of them! One of them&#39;s about to transform into a daemon, I think?</p>
<p>A man yells, &quot;<strong>Seres!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>A burst of flame and the Prickleboar is out.</p>
<p>Velvet mentions it&#39;s an exorcist arte!</p>
<p>Arthur appears, and tells her that her emotions will be her downfall.</p>
<p>He&#39;s talking to someone that Velvet can&#39;t see...so only Arthur can see Seres.</p>
<p>Arthur recites his fourth maxim: &quot;<strong>Never let your guard down, even when victorious.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Yikes...the Prickleboars laying there...eeeee...</p>
<p>Arthur mentions that a certain someone that he&#39;s meeting with is late. He tasks Velvet with getting Laphi&#39;s medicine. He also points out there&#39;s daemons around! Uh oh...</p>
<p>Arthur says only exorcists can handle daemons. That&#39;s the way it is, he says.</p>
<p>She asks him if she can be an exorcist.</p>
<p>Arthur says, to paraphrase, only people can be born to be an exorcist, not made.</p>
<p>So only exorcists can see Seres...</p>
<p>And Velvet levels up!</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Velvet&#39;s still conflicted about the Prickleboars from earlier, saying that she should have let them go...</p>
<p>We head back to town, and Velvet greets her friend Niko.</p>
<p>Niko mentions if Velvet were a boy, she&#39;d be in love...</p>
<p>Why can&#39;t there be girls in love with each other in this series? That&#39;s also possible, right?</p>
<p>Niko tells her to change her style. Velvet mentions her comb broke. Velvet looks at a comb for sale, but she&#39;s worried about Laphicet.</p>
<p>The shopkeeper tells Velvet the medicine for Laphicet hasn&#39;t arrived. Oh my god...</p>
<p>The daemons have already crawled into the city, hopefully not into the village...</p>
<p>So the city&#39;s called <strong>Midgand</strong>, and the daemons have pushed the army there back.</p>
<p>So Arthur is Velvet&#39;s brother-in-law, meaning he was married to Celica...</p>
<p>The shopkeeper indirectly (or unintentionally?) insults Velvet by mentioning Arthur&#39;s right hand. Velvet&#39;s not too happy with what he said, and takes off.</p>
<p>Niko begs Velvet for that quiche recipe. It&#39;s, in her own words, &quot;life or death&quot; for her.</p>
<p>Velvet asks Niko what her parents would think about her boyfriend.</p>
<p>Niko doesn&#39;t care about what other people have to say about her date with local vet.</p>
<p>Velvet tells Niko if Velvet were a boy, she&#39;d be in love with her...</p>
<p>I save and stop here.</p>
<p>I&#39;m guessing why Arthur&#39;s right side is covered by his black coat: it&#39;s to hide something that happened to his right arm, probably from what happened seven years ago...</p>
<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> Is it just me, or does Velvet&#39;s personality remind me of Korra&#39;s a bit?</p>

<p>We&#39;re now inside a storage room...</p>
<p>Magilou smells more <strong>Flamestone, or melchionite</strong>, only found in Northgand.</p>
<p>So basically, flamestone&#39;s the equivalent of coal, huh?</p>
<p>The child&#39;s gone, but we&#39;re now in <strong>Hellawes</strong> proper.</p>
<p>Rokurou suggets looking for the local maritime guild to fix up the ship, and to find a sailor.</p>
<p>Magilou should be a narrator.</p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s thinking of looking for weapons, even though (as Velvet points out) he&#39;s carrying one. Nope, not a chance, he says. Must be his family&#39;s rules that can&#39;t allow him to wield it, I think.</p>
<p>We take everything we could forage inside the storehouse before heading outside.</p>
<p>The port outside looks cold and beautiful.</p>
<p>More treasures to forage and take!</p>
<p>More people are talking about the strict inspections that the Abbey&#39;s taking ever since a disaster happened...hmmm....</p>
<p>There&#39;s also pirates in this game, too, huh?</p>
<p>One merchant mentions it&#39;ll take a week to go to Loegres from Hellawes, where Artorius, &quot;the world&#39;s savior&quot;, is.</p>
<p>One child wants to be an exorcist. So do others. But, as one of them points out, they &quot;work hard&quot; to protect everyone from daemons, hence why they look up to them.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> (thinking) &quot;Hmmm...they&#39;re treated like heroes. I suppose to normal people, they are.&quot;</p>
<p>One mentions a praetor <strong>Teresa</strong>, who can manipulate child malakhim. Eeeeee....</p>
<p>Another mentions a blond praetor (Oscar?) too, holding a big book.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We&#39;re now in the city proper.</p>
<p>So Hellawes is headed by praetor <strong>Teresa Linares</strong>, known as the &quot;praetor of praetors,&quot; and has plenty of exorcists here.</p>
<p>Thanks to the exorcists, according to another citizen, the daemons are already on the run.</p>
<p>Other local children mention their relatives, who&#39;ve been lost to daemons...Velvet points out their &quot;thirst for revenge.&quot;</p>
<p>I see the guild ayonder.</p>
<p>Velvet notices the shipping guild, while Rokurou runs off to get some weapons.</p>
<p>The guild&#39;s going through tough times as the Abbey&#39;s cracking down on them...</p>
<p>I see a Katz box!</p>
<p>The box needs 15 spirits to open, which we have and do. We rescue a Katz, and get another fashion accessory: <strong>Square Glasses!</strong></p>
<p>Bye, cute Katz!</p>
<p>We save at the point near the sanctuary.</p>

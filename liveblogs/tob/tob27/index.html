<p>I&#39;m now off to the battleship...</p>
<p>Outside again, where I push a boulder down to the lower parts of the gate below. It seems to have done something down there...</p>
<p>After getting Plain Paper from a gold chest, we climb down to see the boulder&#39;s damage...</p>
<p>It seems to have broken a small part of the bridge here, or rather, it destroyed another boulder. We go into the next door at the western part of the Gate.</p>
<p>Inside again, where I avoid nearby monsters and climb another set of steps to the ground floor.</p>
<p>Rokurou asks Eizen how they&#39;ll stop the battleship. By either igniting their own supply of gunpowder, or turning the cannons to the ship and firing, I think.</p>
<p>We also get some <strong>Sake</strong> from a nearby open crate...that&#39;s the first time that&#39;s been featured in a <em>Tales</em> game, I think.</p>
<p>At the end of the hallway we come across an orderly in a white suit of armor...it&#39;s another praetor.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Praetor:</strong> &quot;I will cut down any who consort with daemons. Face the fury of the Rangetsu sword style!&quot; Huh? Wait a minute, <strong>what!?</strong></p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s reaction is more low key than mine, but it&#39;s the same...</p>
<p>Rokurou decides to fight the praetor one-on-one.</p>
<p>But the party&#39;s still here. They&#39;re not letting him go at it alone...</p>
<p>To even the odds a bit, the praetor summons two mammal malakhim.</p>
<p>Rokurou threatens Eizen (the reaper!) if he tries to get in his way.</p>
<p>Since I&#39;m controlling Rokurou, I have him attack the praetor head-on...</p>
<p>The rest of the party takes care of his malakhim, and targets the praetor.</p>
<p>Rokurou tells the rest to stop the battleship. He knows the praetor&#39;s not fighting at full power.</p>
<p>The praetor asks Rokurou how he knows about the Rangetsu style. You&#39;re talking to a family member, praetor...</p>
<p>The praetor mentions a &quot;legate <strong>Shigure of the Abbey.</strong>&quot; Oh! So this Shigure person must be an exorcist praetor.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Lies. He&#39;d never take on a student.&quot; Things have changed, Rokurou.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Let me guess. He taught you a few things when he was super bored, and then crushed you with them.&quot;</p>
<p>Their fight is on!</p>
<p>Velvet and the rest take care of the last of the daemonblighted exorcists on the ship!</p>
<p>Eizen&#39;s set the signal, and Rokurou&#39;s finished off the praetor...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Now Rokurou knows where Shigure is. I&#39;m guessing Shigure must be one of his brothers, and the same person that ordered him to be locked up in Titania.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Yo! The Abbey&#39;s my goal now too. Now I can do what I have to do and repay my debt at the same time.&quot; He now wants revenge too.</p>
<p>The child malak gasps in shock at the corpse!</p>
<p>Eizen compliments Rokurou as &quot;a fine companion for the reaper.&quot;</p>

<p>And what Rokurou says next about how they make their blades (rumor or not) makes me shudder even more...</p>
<p>The clan, though, became extinct.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Sounds like there&#39;s even more to [Rokurou&#39;s] clan than the rumors say.&quot; Oh boy...what rumors?</p>
<p>Now for the control room...</p>
<p>While heading back up to the save point at the central gate hall, I take a look at the damaged battleship...</p>
<p>We head out to the passage next to the KO&#39;d guard. The path to the door to the other side&#39;s blocked by boulders. We use some stray planks to scale the side of the wall to make it to the next door.</p>
<p>We climb the ladder up to the west gate&#39;s roof, where there&#39;s a plethora of monsters about...</p>
<p>Climbing down to the northern part of the gate, and into the control room we go...</p>
<p>But instead, I climb a set of hanging ivy on the right side of the doors, scale the roof, and jump down to get an Earth Ring...</p>
<p>We fit into the window&#39;s wide gap to make it to the control room...</p>
<p>Velvet and team split up to find the key.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>There&#39;s a lot of books and knickknacks here.</p>
<p>The malak child spots another compass and grabs it from the top of the shelf! Velvet&#39;s got the key, but the compass hits the child&#39;s head! Eee...</p>
<p>Oh boy, what is she going to do? I&#39;m nervous...</p>
<p>She pats him on the head and smiles!</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Don&#39;t get so worked over a little thing like that. It&#39;s proof you&#39;re alive....No, I&#39;m talking about the pain.&quot;<br>
<strong>Malak child:</strong> &quot;But...but I&#39;m scared of pain.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Well [...] who isn&#39;t?&quot;<br>
<strong>Malak child:</strong> &quot;Even you?&quot;</p>
<p>So the malak child got curious over the compass after reading it in a book, just like Velvet&#39;s brother...</p>
<p><strong>Malak child:</strong> &quot;I thought that if I had one of these [compasses], maybe I could go on adventures. It&#39;s exciting.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;When you feel that way, you should talk about it....what you like or [not]. If you&#39;re happy or scared. After all, you&#39;re alive.&quot;<br>
<strong>Malak child:</strong> &quot;I&#39;m...alive.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s just my opinion, though. Not an order.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou and Eizen meet up with Velvet and the malak child. It&#39;s the first time the malak child&#39;s been praised for anything...he blushes and thanks them.</p>
<p><strong>Another skit:</strong> The child&#39;s still a bit bumped after the compass fell on his head.</p>
<p>Rokurou jokes of pushing his bump back down to heal it...oh, Rokurou.</p>
<p>Velvet suggests getting a bag of sugar and rubbing it on his bump to make it feel better. Ice is a better option.</p>
<p><strong>Skit</strong> again: The malak child&#39;s still fascinated by the compass. Rokurou compliments him on the bag he&#39;s wearing. It&#39;s made from Maurits silk. Eizen explains where the silk&#39;s from, and lists the many benefits of the fine material.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Knowledge and experience help you sniff out the best treasure.&quot; He&#39;s right. The <em>Uncharted</em> games are proof of that.</p>
<p>In the end, Eizen also says to just put the compass in the bag.</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Velvet promises the malak child that she won&#39;t get angry if he expresses himself.</p>
<p>We unlock the door, and head outside.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Let&#39;s get our gate on!&quot; Lol...</p>
<p>These Wall Men are pretty tough punchers...</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Alright, it&#39;s open!&quot;</p>
<p>A noise is heard! The reactions of the party are memetic...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/yfrJ9UV.png alt="rxns of cannon" width=480 height=270 id=hd-liveblog></p>
<p>It&#39;s a signal that the <em>Van Eltia</em>&#39;s coming!</p>
<p>I save before heading in. I have a feeling we might have to face another boss...</p>
<p>But no boss yet as we head outside, get some stuff here, and climb the long ladder up...</p>
<p>Another long ladder to climb and into the door we go...</p>
<p>There&#39;s the lever!</p>
<p>Or one of the levers. Eizen explains that the gate has two doors, so we&#39;re only opening one door...</p>
<p>Velvet pulls the lever!</p>
<p>We climb up to the eastern roof now...</p>
<p>...and go to the other side, and pull the second lever!</p>
<p><a name=6></a></p>
<hr>
<p>That&#39;s it, the gate is open!</p>
<p>We go through the door, and find another Katz box! We get <strong>Rosy Cheeks</strong> as a reward!</p>
<p>Going back now...</p>
<p>Oh no, it&#39;s the guard again! He&#39;s catching daemonblight...and he&#39;s transformed into a wall monster!</p>
<p>And the malak child&#39;s looking at his compass, unaware that the guard&#39;s lunging at him...</p>
<p>Velvet pulls him away...</p>
<p>There goes another compass...</p>
<p>The wall monster&#39;s called a <strong>Guardian</strong>.</p>
<p>I get another tutorial on Break Gauges this time...</p>
<p>Also, if I finish a monster with a <strong>Mystic Arte</strong> (another staple of the <em>Tales</em> series), I get a better chance of getting an item!</p>
<p>Another pointer on Mystic Artes: combo limits are ignored!</p>
<p>But I don&#39;t defeat him, as he&#39;s strong against non-elemental attacks...</p>
<p>I switch to Rokurou again since the game switched me back to Velvet for the tutorial.</p>
<p>This guy...whenever he guards he becomes his namesake...</p>
<p>Now he does his Wall Charge and I move out of the way...</p>
<p>How to perform that Mystic Arte again?</p>
<p>But, Rokurou doesn&#39;t have a Mystic Arte at this point...</p>
<p>But no matter, since we take care of the boss. Velvet and crew walk away like badasses...</p>
<p><a name=7></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Below, the whole gate is swarming with daemons and monsters!</p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s now worried about their clean getaway...</p>
<p>The <em>Van Eltia</em> makes another signal!</p>
<p>Velvet asks Eizen to signal the ship to not stop! Velvet decides to jump down to it while it&#39;s moving!</p>
<p>Eizen&#39;s way ahead of Velvet, as the ship&#39;s ordered to move without stopping. It was part of the plan.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Welcome to the Aifread way.&quot; He smiles as he looks away.</p>
<p>Now another cutscene, where the <em>Van Eltia</em> emerges!</p>
<p>The malak child&#39;s still looking around for the compass...</p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s unsure whether the plan will work...</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Do you want the reaper&#39;s reassurance?&quot;</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/lXj3Aoj.png alt="reapers reassurance?" width=480 height=270 id=hd-liveblog></p>
<p>Rokurou sweats.</p>
<p>The malak child&#39;s still looking for the compass.</p>
<p>The two men jump down!</p>
<p><a name=8></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Velvet looks back, and the malak child gets the compass! Too bad the Guardian wakes up! <strong>Ai yaaaaaa!!!</strong></p>
<p>The shockwave of the Guardian&#39;s stomps sends the child leaping!</p>
<p>He gets the compass, but he starts falling down to the ocean below...</p>
<p>Another flashback...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong><em>LAPHICET!!!</em></strong>&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Run Velvet run!</strong></p>
<p>She catches him!</p>
<p>At the ship, Magilou jumps for joy!</p>
<p>Benwick has the wheel. </p>
<p>Velvet grabs the malak child and jumps down to the <em>Van Eltia</em>, making it to her sail and sliding down to the deck...another happy landing.</p>
<p>We get our rewards, as Rokurou and Eizen earn their Mystic Artes, and a <strong>Seer&#39;s Glacite</strong>...</p>
<p>The BG is formally called a Blast Gauge, and I get a pointer on Arte Counts...</p>

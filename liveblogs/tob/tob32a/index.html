<p>At the inn, Laphicet finds a history book: &quot;The Rise and Fall of Midgand.&quot; He reads it for backstory. It even has its own Dark Ages, where no records were found. Velvet&#39;s familiar with the name Claudin.</p>
<p><strong>Flashback:</strong> Where <strong>that man</strong>&#39;s training Velvet again.</p>
<p>Velvet asks <strong>that man</strong> where he learned his techniques. From his master, Claudin.</p>
<p>Oh my god...those days...</p>
<p><strong>That man</strong> says her execution of the forms he&#39;s taught her strays &quot;from the ideal.&quot;</p>
<p>He also tells her that she resembles Claudin in a way. He mentions that he also wore a cape...he admires Claudin, mentioning the four elements when praising his qualities.</p>
<p>Velvet wants to meet Claudin. But &quot;it&#39;s impossible,&quot; as he passed on trying to protect <strong>that man</strong>.</p>
<p>Velvet thinks it&#39;s impossible that her master&#39;s master can&#39;t be the same Claudin...since he existed 3 centuries ago. Or maybe it&#39;s a different Claudin.</p>
<p>King Claudin had very high acclaim among the people.</p>
<p>All of the rules of Midgand were directly related to the King, says Eizen. Probably the reason why the kingdom wanted to make <strong>that man</strong> the Shepherd, he deduces, was to relive or re-enact the glory days of the Empire post-Dark Ages.</p>
<p>Eizen then says the Shepherd title gives hope to the ordinary masses, who then give him support, meaning he can manipulate the masses into doing what he wants.</p>
<p>And Velvet knows how devoted <strong>that man</strong> is to that job...</p>

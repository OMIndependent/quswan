<p>No Abbey guards in the main entrance now...Rokurou notices too.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Think it&#39;s a good thing or a bad thing?&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;I&#39;d say good. We can march straight in!&quot;</p>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/fa7wF2u_uqg>The music sounds nice and majestic</a>, while the ruins look vast.</p>
<p>We come across our first enemies here, <strong>Malakhim Zombie</strong>s, and <strong>Night Flapper</strong>s, or white-winged bats!</p>
<p><strong>Roving Spirit</strong>s are in this area as well...they&#39;re really tough since they come in huge waves and can cast so many artes so fast on us!</p>
<p>Velvet points out the monster malakhim on patrol. Eleanor warns us that the exorcists here must be close.</p>
<p>There&#39;s also a nor doll in the ruins.</p>
<p>I open a Katz Box which requires 320 spirits to open! We get <strong>Angel Wings</strong> as a reward!</p>
<p>A new malakhim enemy: <strong>Arcane Armor</strong> is close! Their whispering is a bit unsetlling...</p>
<p>In another battle with Arcane Armor, I unleash Velvet&#39;s second <strong>Mystic Arte!!</strong></p>
<p>Through the door into the second area now...</p>
<p>On the west and east corridors here, it seems there&#39;s more sealed doors. Now to find the candles to unlock them...</p>
<p>After doing that, I head to the northern door.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Are they all exorcists? Some of them looked like merchants.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;There&#39;s a town past these ruins; it was probably them. No need for us to approach and cause trouble for ourselves.&quot;</p>
<p>Looks like we found our route to the northern town in case we ever go through there.</p>
<p>I turn back and go to the west stairway down...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Skit:</strong> Phi points out the gloomy feeling in the Faldies Ruins. Eleanor asks why. There&#39;s too many people who have lost their lives here, I bet.</p>
<p>Eizen tells Phi to &quot;trust his feelings.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;They often lead you to the truth of things. Besides, what you&#39;re feeling would explain a thing or two about these ruins.&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen points out that the ruins were intended to have &quot;strength and stability&quot; in mind.</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;They were anticipating volcanic earthquakes. And they expected that someone may turn violent in these passageways.&quot;</p>
<p>Phi thinks there&#39;s a &quot;passage&quot; leading downwards. I agree. This could be the right place to keep a therion.</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;A prison for the worst criminals...or maybe a battle arena.&quot;</p>
<p>Phi assumes there&#39;s treasure underneath these halls if it was an arena.</p>
<p>Eizen&#39;s wondering about the hidden treasure part now. Velvet tells them to think about that for &quot;another day.&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen&#39;s still thinking about the treasure.</p>
<p>The Roving Spirits also have a very awful attack, <strong>To Heaven</strong>, that holds and burns their target! I fell for that attack many times now!</p>
<p>We proceed north, where from a distant cell near a chest we get the second Nor Doll, a <strong>red</strong> one!</p>
<p>The White Turtlez gives another letter to Eizen. Phi&#39;s offered by Eizen to read it. Rokurou takes it and reads it in a funny voice. Oh my god, Rokurou...hee...</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;&#39;Your cruelty knows no bounds! You bring deep sadness to a fair maiden&#39;s heart with each passing day! Repent, or else, I&#39;ll be forced to intervene. This is your final warning!&#39;...and that&#39;s it.&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou trolls Eizen over the &quot;fair maiden.&quot; Eizen&#39;s comeback is one of pure fire...ohhhh!</p>
<p>Phi assumes that it&#39;s from Eizen&#39;s sister. Rokurou thinks &quot;he&#39;s onto something.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor asks Velvet&#39;s sure if Eizen&#39;s sister wrote these threats...</p>
<p>Eizen insists his sister doesn&#39;t write such a letter.</p>
<p>Magilou trolls Eizen again.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;<strong>Damnation, Magilou!</strong>&quot; Then he gets into angry overprotective big brother mode and wants that &quot;lover&quot; to face him!</p>
<p>Phi asks him to go see her if he&#39;s so worried.</p>
<p>He only went back to visit her once. Then a crowd affected by malevolence became daemons and went after his sister.</p>
<p>Eleanor sees the nor dolls&#39; unsettling nature as part of their charm.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Into the south hall of cells here, and I find a <strong>Saturn Satchel</strong> for Phi!</p>
<p>So the east wing is our way forward. We turn back upstairs.</p>
<p>Now downwards and northwards, where I see two chests and a geotree!</p>
<p>One of the chests, a gold chest, has new boots!</p>
<p>There&#39;s also a door forward, but it&#39;s sealed shut. We&#39;ll have to go around this time...</p>
<p>There&#39;s also a sealed door here, but it can be opened through those candles again...</p>
<p>I light a stray candle before a stairway up to the west hall. The way to the west stairway going up to the ruins&#39; main floor is blocked by rubble!</p>
<p>And I light another one, which opens another sealed door to a third candle!</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been trying for the longest time to unleash Eleanor&#39;s second Mystic Arte, but no good...</p>
<p>After a few battles, I light the second candle, and the seal on the door&#39;s broken!</p>
<p>The exorcist guards are asking about Medissa at this point. They report that &quot;she&#39;s calm&quot; since they told her &quot;the truth&quot; for some reason.</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s in shock.</p>
<p>They&#39;re thinking of controlling her, huh?</p>
<p>We face them! They unleash their malakhim, more spellcasters!</p>
<p>The <strong>Two-Sword Praetor</strong>s that we face can also cast spells too.</p>
<p>My god, that was a tough miniboss group!</p>
<p>Our expedition crew&#39;s returned with the <strong>Eye of Atamoni Statue!</strong></p>
<p>And we get a new skill and costumes!</p>
<p>Magilou looks at the Eye of Atamoni...</p>
<p>Eizen can imagine a floating city using &quot;a larger version&quot; of the stone. But Magilou wonders about the usefulness of having a floating city...</p>
<p>Back to the main story...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;So Medissa really is here.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;But...what&#39;s this about the &#39;truth&#39; and &#39;controlling&#39; her?&quot;</p>
<p>I light up a nearby candle and head to the east hall to light that one.</p>
<p>Down to the depths we go...</p>
<p>We&#39;re now in a room with plenty of columns. The door ahead is also a sealed one.</p>
<p>Now to find those candles...</p>
<p>I save before heading into the chamber ahead, knowing we&#39;re going to be in for a big fight...</p>

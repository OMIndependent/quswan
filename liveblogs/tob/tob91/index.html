<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;The Faldies Ruins are north of Hellawes.&quot;<br>
<strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;The earthpulse point is to the north too. Probably in the very same place.&quot;</p>
<p>A citizen tells us the secret entrance is out due to an avalanche.</p>
<p>We find the geotree and use the board in another area to reach the previously unreachable chest, where I find a <strong>Gold Scrap!</strong></p>
<p>The shipwreck here now has the code red daemon nearby, the <strong>Managarmr!</strong></p>
<p>I save before fighting him.</p>
<p>Looks like Eizen has a <strong>Resurrection</strong> arte in his skill set!</p>
<p>We return to town, and talk to a fisherman who mentions the history of Hellawes as a fishing town.</p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s like Steven. He&#39;s hopeful and he wishes everyone could pitch in together.</p>
<p><strong>Fisherman:</strong> &quot;Once money gets involved, people change. That&#39;s true no matter what age you live in. The people know it&#39;s the ones making the money who lead the charge but we follow anyway.&quot;</p>
<p>The Bloodwing next to him proves they can rebuild Hellawes again.</p>
<p>Exiting down the storehouse, we see another ingredient for the Omega Elixir: a <strong>Unicorn&#39;s Horn!</strong></p>
<p>Magilou gets jumpy again, telling us people lose their powers &quot;if anyone other than a maiden of pure touches&quot; the horn.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s pretty. Nobody here fits that description.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s offended.</p>
<p>My god, Rokurou, you are so old-fashioned...</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Your view of women is completely messed up.&quot; True. Plus, he&#39;s hanging out with Velvet. Shouldn&#39;t he have changed that mindset a bit at least? He doesn&#39;t know that.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Well, personally, I&#39;d liken myself to a maiden who&#39;s maxed out her purity stat by her third playthrough.&quot; Magilou&#39;s breaking the fourth wall again!</p>
<p>Velvet asks Phi to take the unicorn horn. I agree. He asks if she&#39;s sure about that. He&#39;s the only one who&#39;s pure of heart in the crew, I think.</p>
<p>Plus, he wants to make the elixir, Velvet adds.</p>
<p>Eizen tells Phi not to worry about Magilou&#39;s maiden tale. He explains where unicorn horns actually come from: a <strong>narwhal whale.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Hah! At least we&#39;ve established that Magilou wouldn&#39;t be able to hold a real unicorn&#39;s horn.&quot;</p>
<p>The citizens here say the same thing about the blocked road. They&#39;re lying. The game devs don&#39;t want us going through here because we might get the unicorn horn easily.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The next place the expedition ship&#39;s found is a <em>Tales of Destiny</em> ref!</p>
<p>As for us, we sail for Reneed!</p>
<p>We go to Videl! He&#39;s found another ingredient, and he tells us more about the Omega Elixir: <strong>it was meant to be a cure to the 12 Year Sickness!</strong> Oh my god!</p>
<p>Velvet also points out her brother had the 12 Year Sickness!</p>
<p>So Videl has it too...and he&#39;s almost turning 12! Oh no...</p>
<p>Phi vows to get the ingredients for the Omega Elixir. But Videl can&#39;t make it...Phi&#39;s not giving up!</p>
<p>Videl grows envious of Phi, pointing out that Phi&#39;s lucky he gets to travel.</p>
<p>Eleanor tries to cheer Phi up.</p>
<p>Phi still wants to help Videl, though, by making the Omega Elixir.</p>
<p>Magilou points out that <strong>no one</strong> has been cured of the 12 Year Sickness. Eizen thinks that it&#39;s a genetic disease.</p>
<p>Magilou thinks it&#39;s a curse.</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s brooding over whether her brother had the 12 Year Sickness...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>Did</strong> [the Shepherd] <strong>know that when he decided to sacrifice Laphi? Was there never any hope to save him at all?</strong>&quot; <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Now our next instructions are to get a <strong>cloud sheep egg</strong>, which are in marshes like Galles Lake.</p>
<p>We use an Inoph Bottle to go the Eastern Galles Lake Road, and get the cloud sheep egg.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;I&#39;ve never seen Laphicet so animated.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;He&#39;s never really lost anything, so he can still believe in hope.&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s a dark way of putting it.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet thinks that if Videl passes away, Phi might &quot;change his tune.&quot; No, he&#39;s probably going to be like Eleanor.</p>
<p>Rokurou asks if she&#39;s sure. Velvet thinks everyone she knows is like that.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Then how do you explain yourself? You&#39;ve lost.&quot;</p>
<p>He smiles.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;You&#39;ve been hit hard with reality. You don&#39;t have any hope for anything. <strong>So why do you risk your life with this revenge business?</strong>&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>Why the hell shouldn&#39;t I!?</strong> There&#39;s no hope waiting for me on the other side of revenge. I know [...] it won&#39;t fix anything or bring anyone back. But it&#39;s [...] better than sitting around doing nothing.&quot; She&#39;s pained hearing this question.</p>
<p>If Phi proves Velvet wrong, and Videl does get better...</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;And that&#39;s probably how Laphicet feels right now too.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;I can&#39;t let go of my anger and sorrow, and he can&#39;t bring himself to stop holding onto hope...this is how far he will go for his friends...&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;You two are both illogical for sure, but, a [...] daemon like me doesn&#39;t feel the same need for action.&quot;</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Where is Videl?</p>
<p>I decide to head to Port Cadnix to get the <strong>Nor Doll.</strong></p>
<p>So the Nor Doll&#39;s on top of a crate near the weapons merchant.</p>
<p>Eleanor senses something on the Nor Doll which feels, to Rokurou, &quot;calming, yet glamorous.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Like I said, a quiet radiance.&quot;</p>
<p>Bienfu thinks he&#39;s cuter than the doll. Velvet points out he&#39;s creepy for wearing the hat.</p>
<p>But Eleanor senses something &quot;ominous&quot; as well. Phi thinks it&#39;s &quot;cute&quot; like a &quot;baby.&quot; Eizen recalls his little sister again when she was young. Awww...</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;I swore to myself I&#39;d always do whatever I could to protect her. Once she got a little older...lots of...things began to happen around us. Wherever we went, she was in danger. Daemons attacked us, a dragon tried to kidnap her. That&#39;s when I first realized what it was that I carried...&quot; Oh god...</p>
<p>So that&#39;s how he journeyed alone, then he &quot;met Aifread.&quot; Aifread explained the nor dolls to Eizen.</p>
<p>Phi decides to collect them all. He &quot;thinks something good will happen&quot; if we collect them. He points out that Eizen shared his backstory a bit more thanks to getting the doll.</p>
<p>From the scout ship we get a Lens and a new recipe, a <strong>Garlic Rainbow Nautilus!</strong></p>
<p>Beardsley&#39;s even seen the smoke from the raid in Hellawes. Beardsley is hesitating to help their neighboring town since Hellawes &quot;ignored&quot; and belittled Beardsley &quot;for years.&quot;</p>
<p>Standing before a tree, the Bloodwing agent rewards us for beating the Managarmr.</p>
<p>Another Katz is there with a new minigame: <strong>Coin Collector!</strong></p>
<p>Dyle&#39;s father is still asking us if we&#39;ve seen Dyle...</p>
<p>This is the first time I get a mention of a &quot;Lord of Calamity,&quot; from a villager sitting on a bench.</p>
<p>Now off to the Faldies Ruins!</p>

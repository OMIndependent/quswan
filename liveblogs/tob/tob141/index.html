<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>In the inn, a woman tells us about a talking pengyon. Huh? </p>
<p>It&#39;s true. Magilou wants to catch the pengyon like a Pokemon, without the ball.</p>
<p>But, in Yseult, that&#39;s a bad omen...</p>
<p>The pengyon yells out that &quot;[it&#39;s] a medical student from Rieze Maxia!&quot; <strong>What!?</strong> So that must be...</p>
<p>She warns us not to visit Maclir Beach when it&#39;s nighttime.</p>
<p>From a peddler, we learn that the awakening of the Empyreans has caused massive changes in the weather...</p>
<p>We stay for a night.</p>
<p>Velvet decides to head to the beach...uh oh...</p>
<p>Magilou decides to go with her.</p>
<p>Laphicet too. It&#39;s about the talking pengyon.</p>
<p>I quick save before heading out.</p>
<p>Laphicet sees the pengyon!</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Think it might be the talking one?&quot;</p>
<p>It probably is...</p>
<p>We slowly approach it.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Pengyon:</strong> &quot;Oh, good evening. Lovely weather, isn&#39;t it?&quot; He does sound familiar...</p>
<p>Eleanor and Laphicet are in shock!</p>
<p><strong>Pengyon:</strong> &quot;Wait, do you guys eat us pengyons too? Please answer...it&#39;s very important.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor comes clean that she eats them. Velvet eats everything.</p>
<p><strong>Pengyon:</strong> &quot;Well then, I suppose you people are just like the others who came before. I can&#39;t let you keep doing that!&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou decides to play with fate, and taunt him.</p>
<p>The pengyon transforms!</p>
<p>Into <a href=http://aselia.wikia.com/wiki/Jude_Mathis><strong>Jude Mathis!</strong></a> Aaaaaahhhh! Oh my god!!!</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Wahhh! He changed into a human!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Who the hell are you?&quot;<br>
<strong>Jude:</strong> &quot;Sorry for deceiving you all...<strong>but I can&#39;t let you hurt any more pengyons!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>And after we fight, he turns back into a pengyon!</p>
<p>So he&#39;s protecting pengyons from poachers...</p>
<p>Rokurou explains that they eat anything. Eleanor mentions she only eats pengyons she bought.</p>
<p>Eizen sums up the crew very well.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;We&#39;re not good people, but we&#39;re not those kinds of villains, either.&quot;</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Jude apologizes.</p>
<p>Velvet asks who he actually is, thinking he&#39;s a &quot;special representative of pengyon-kind&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Jude:</strong> &quot;<strong>I&#39;m Jude Mathis. I&#39;m a medical student from Rieze Maxia.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet doesn&#39;t know where that is.</p>
<p><strong>Jude:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s in a different world from yours. Actually, I&#39;m a human just like you all, but...somehow, I was flung into this dimension, and when I came to, I looked like this.&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou and Rokurou are trying to believe all this themselves...</p>
<p>So he got taken in by pengyons, and is now protecting them...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;But don&#39;t you have bigger things to worry about right now?&quot;</p>
<p>She calls him &quot;too soft-hearted.&quot; That&#39;s definitely Jude.</p>
<p><strong>Jude:</strong> &quot;I get that a lot.&quot;</p>
<p>The crew can&#39;t do anything for him. He&#39;ll figure it out, he says.</p>
<p><strong>Jude:</strong> &quot;The problem is that a friend of mine got sent to this world with me, but I haven&#39;t been able to find her. My hunch is that she&#39;s also turned into a pengyon. You haven&#39;t heard of any other talking pengyons, have you?&quot;</p>
<p>None.</p>
<p>Eizen asks what his friend looks like.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Jude:</strong> &quot;<strong>Her name is Milla.</strong> She has pretty red eyes and long golden hair. She carries herself with dignity and possesses a commanding presence...oh, and <strong>one of her quirks is that whenever she sees something tasty...she drools.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Jude:</strong> &quot;Also, <strong>she&#39;s known as the &quot;Lord of Spirits&quot; because she&#39;s accompanied by four Summon Spirits with command over the elements.</strong>&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Ooooh, Lord of Spirits. How royal-sounding.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;I know it&#39;s hard, but try to keep your spirits up, Jude!&quot;<br>
<strong>Jude:</strong> &quot;Thank you all so much! I hope you guys get a lead on Milla!&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;You care about her even more than yourself.&quot;<br>
<strong>Jude:</strong> &quot;...she&#39;s just...a really special person to me, I guess.&quot;</p>
<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> This game calls <a href=https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes#The_Adventure_of_the_Blanched_Soldier>the Sherlock Holmes quote</a> (&quot;When you have eliminated the impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth&quot;) as Hao&#39;s Egg Theorem, instead of Howe&#39;s. Translation error?</p>
<p>The next morning, Eleanor thought she was dreaming last night. Laphicet says the pengyon&#39;s real, and he&#39;s Jude.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;He said he came from another world. No matter how much we see, life is full of mysteries, isn&#39;t it?&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;He&#39;s got guts, I&#39;ll give him that.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;If he was telling the truth, that would make him a castaway from another dimension.&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou&#39;s more interested in &quot;this Milla girl, the Lord of Spirits.&quot; She thinks she might know the Four Empyreans. I don&#39;t think so.</p>
<p><strong>I&#39;ll have to fight him again since I missed his Mystic Arte!</strong></p>

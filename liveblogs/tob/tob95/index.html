<p>Outside at Figahl Icecaps, Phi asks Eleanor about whether he hurt Medissa&#39;s feelings.</p>
<p>It feels so sad... </p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s okay with Phi stepping in to stop Medissa.</p>
<p>Velvet thinks Eleanor should stop feeling responsible or guilty for her actions. She&#39;s concerned about her getting malevolence.</p>
<p>Eizen mentions some of the causes of malevolence: pride and wrath. Is it possible that having an excess of the Seven Deadly Sins causes it?</p>
<p>So counting out Velvet since she&#39;s a therion, Rokurou&#39;s the only party member who fell to his own malevolence: wrath (or maybe pride?).</p>
<p>As for Eleanor, Eizen and Magilou point out she has an incorruptible pure pureness and her self-awareness of &quot;her ego.&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen says she&#39;s okay for the time being.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;But human hearts are fickle things. Who knows what the future holds?&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;For most exorcists, &quot;purity&quot; is a construct of the Abbey&#39;s teachings.&quot; Ain&#39;t that the truth?</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;But Eleanor... She&#39;s the real deal.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;She&#39;s not your average exorcist, I&#39;ll give you that.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Purity is handy for any exorcist. But more than that, it&#39;s a rare and precious temperament for living...facing one&#39;s own ugliness in an honest manner is never easy. To be a normal human is to live carrying malevolence. It&#39;s just how much you let it control you that varies.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet points out the Shepherd&#39;s not willing to face that malevolence is a part of life, hence why he sticks to cold reason.</p>
<p>Inside the town, everyone&#39;s carrying on as usual.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We immediately go back to Titania.</p>
<p>It&#39;s nightfall.</p>
<p>Medissa threatens that she&#39;s going to unleash destruction on Titania once she&#39;s free.</p>
<p><strong>Medissa:</strong> &quot;You&#39;d better sleep with one eye open.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> (deadpan) &quot;Look how worried I am.&quot;</p>
<p>Kamoana runs to the crew!</p>
<p>Medissa gasps and sees Kamoana! She points out that she&#39;s the same age as Diana!</p>
<p>Kamoana&#39;s scared stiff of Medissa and runs away...and trips! </p>
<p>Eleanor frees Medissa and asks her to go to Kamoana.</p>
<p>Medissa introduces herself to the crying Kamoana. Awww...</p>
<p><strong>Medissa:</strong> &quot;Do I scare you, honey?&quot;<br>
<strong>Kamoana:</strong> &quot;A little. But not so much as Velvet and Dyle.&quot;</p>
<p>She asks her if she&#39;s scary.</p>
<p>She mentions her nightmare about her mother...</p>
<p>Medissa hugs her, and tells her that she&#39;s a mother.</p>
<p>Happy Mother&#39;s Day indeed...</p>
<p><strong>Medissa:</strong> &quot;Mothers always love their children no matter what. No matter if we die... no matter how the world changes.&quot;</p>
<p>Medissa tears up too.</p>
<p>Kamoana consoles her.</p>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/3dhpIEerwng>&quot;Fond Memories&quot;</a> would&#39;ve been perfect for this scene...</p>
<p>Thank goodness Phi spared Medissa!</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;I hope Kamoana and Medissa won&#39;t have to feel so lonely anymore...&quot;</p>
<p>Phi asks Velvet about her mother.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;She&#39;s dead. I lost her when I was even younger than you...&quot;</p>
<p>Phi apologizes.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;It just means we&#39;ve got things in common.&quot; She smiles.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;So no feeling sad and alone, okay?&quot;</p>
<p>Phi blushes and denies he&#39;s feeling sad.</p>
<p>Velvet tells Eleanor to watch over Medissa and Kamoana. She politely accepts the job.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Are exorcists supposed to be so polite to a Grand Poobah of Calamity or whatever?&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;The daemon lord ought to not trouble herself over such trivialities.&quot; Oh my god, hee.</p>
<p>Benwick comes and tells Velvet to have Phi and her meet Grim in the south tower. She must have found something!</p>
<p>Dyle&#39;s also sobbing too.</p>
<p>Prince Percival shows more appreciation for mothers again.</p>
<p>Even a random pirate&#39;s wanting to be left alone to sob...</p>
<p>Inside the hideout, Phi asks about everyone else&#39;s mothers.</p>
<p>Rokurou called his mother &quot;strict and frightening,&quot; (*<em>shudders</em>*) but she passed away.</p>
<p>Magilou was raised by a &quot;wicked witch.&quot;</p>
<p>Malakhim are born &quot;from untainted mana,&quot; or &quot;humans are reborn as malakhim,&quot; but they forget everything they remember as a human.</p>
<p>Poor Phi...</p>
<p>Magilou tells Eizen to go &quot;easy&quot; on Phi when explaining these matters.</p>
<p>Eizen cosigns to the idea of found families, saying that one can share strong ties with them even if they&#39;re not related to them. Malakhim can even start families as well...</p>
<p>Rokurou consoles Phi.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We head to the south tower. Before climbing the steps, Eleanor asks how Eizen and her sister (Rqan!) are related.</p>
<p>Eizen explains that he and his sister were born from an earthpulse point.</p>
<p>Rokurou asks if &quot;malakhim are siblings if they come from the same earthpulse point.&quot;</p>
<p>It depends. In Eizen&#39;s case, when she got sad, so would he. Happy, same.</p>
<p>He describes his sister as a bit &quot;abrasive.&quot;</p>
<p>He also mentions more memories. One of them involved giving her a pendant.</p>
<p>Phi asks about Eizen&#39;s pendant if she made it for him. Yes, she did.</p>
<p>There&#39;s also a little self-portrait of Eizen&#39;s sister in the pendant...</p>
<p>Eizen, though, can&#39;t draw.</p>

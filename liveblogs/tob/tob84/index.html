<p>I look back below. My goodness, that&#39;s a very long climb we made!</p>
<p>We circle around the edges of the summit...</p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s awed by the view! Eleanor tells him to not &quot;leap&quot; around a lot.</p>
<p>Laphicet senses tons of earthpulses in the summit.</p>
<p>Eizen explains away the enormous energy exuding from them.</p>
<p>These mountains took only a thousand years compared to tens of thousands of years to rise!</p>
<p>Back in the old, old days, people used artes to control earthpulses and alter the land. Terraforming, huh?</p>
<p>Laphicet wonders how they could do that. Eleanor explains they might have gone to the certain pressure points in the landscape to affect the land around here.</p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s impressed by Eizen&#39;s history.</p>
<p>He still doesn&#39;t know about the flowers growing around here.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s why I travel. To learn.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet explains those flowers are &quot;Aldina Alabastergrass.&quot; Her brother showed her those flowers.</p>
<p>But they&#39;re delicate when alone. When together, they&#39;re strong.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;In some cultures they symbolize kinship, the bonds between people.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;I&#39;ll remember that. You and your brother taught me something new today.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;I&#39;ll never forget either.&quot;</p>
<p>I go to the center of the summit.</p>
<p>This is it! But there&#39;s no therion here and no barrier either.</p>
<p>Laphicet thinks his guess is wrong. Velvet thinks he might have escaped or the dragon &quot;might have been too powerful for the Abbey...&quot; or the tornado must have broken the barrier...</p>
<p>Eizen agrees. Dragons are powerful.</p>
<p>The crew decides to head off to Stonebury.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Am I the only one here who thinks the real problem is how we&#39;re supposed to fight a frickin&#39; dragon?&quot;</p>
<p>What a beautiful view...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Now to fight that King Peacock...</p>
<p>Our expedition returns with more stuff, one of them includes a <strong>Fluffy Repede doll!</strong></p>
<p>We make it to the eastern part of the plains...the star there&#39;s pointing to Stonebury and the dungeon entrance south is probably the forest Bienfu talked about!</p>
<p>Wait, it&#39;s not a forest, it&#39;s a cave!</p>
<p>It&#39;s <strong>Zamahl Grotto, Den of Daemons.</strong></p>
<p>The Abbey&#39;s guarding the entrance.</p>
<p>Turning back, I notice another dungeon entrance way to the north of this area.</p>
<p>On the way, I activate another warp point!</p>
<p>Down the huge hill we go...</p>
<p>From a bronze chest I get the first <strong>All-Divide</strong> in this game!</p>
<p>The baobab-like trees beyond set our destination: <strong>Davahl Forest, Fog Shrouded Mystery.</strong></p>
<p>Look at all of that miasma spurting out here!</p>
<p>Two plant enemies jumped out from the ground! They gave me quite a jump there!</p>
<p>The miasma in-game&#39;s called Red Fumes, and they&#39;re blocking our way forward into the forest. Nothing we can do here for now...</p>
<p>Those trees aren&#39;t baobabs, but they&#39;re clinging on to the thick rock walls. Probably thats why I mistook them for baobabs...</p>
<p>I save before the wooden gates of Stonebury.</p>

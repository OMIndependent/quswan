<p>Another recipe is on our list now, it&#39;s a <strong>vegetable mix!</strong></p>
<p>We head to the shop next to the weapon shop. There&#39;s a lot of bottles and dolls lined up on display!</p>
<p>Laphicet sees that the &quot;dolls look like Bienfu!&quot;</p>
<p>The shopkeeper tells us the dolls are the Empyrean Amenoch herself! Holy heck! Eleanor shares the same reaction as me: surprise!</p>
<p>Amenoch is dignified, the shopkeeper adds, but has a slight temper. She&#39;s not happy because the Abbey banned worship of her...</p>
<p>The shopkeepers visited her on one occasion. She wasn&#39;t feeling too happy either, just sighing...</p>
<p>Laphicet notices something!</p>
<p>Magilou asks if that is actually Amenoch. It is. Then she proudly proclaims &quot;the low energy listless goddess is none other than&quot; Grimoirh! So Amenoch is another name for Grimoirh?</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Grimoirh isn&#39;t human?&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;When did I ever say she was?&quot;</p>
<p>The shopkeeper saw her last on Maclir Beach.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Quickly, to the beach!&quot;</p>
<p><del>Cue Batman transition music!</del></p>
<p>I use up all our herbs before heading out to <strong>Maclir Beach, Thundering Southern Seas.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Beautiful waters. So this is Maclir Beach...&quot;<br>
<strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;I hope she&#39;s actually here...&quot;</p>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/POqGq8L94hw>Here&#39;s the music for Maclir Beach.</a></p>
<p>We start our first battle with a <strong>Sand Mole</strong>, which looks nothing like a mole, and more like the Maul in Burnack Plateau...</p>
<p>Huge biodiversity here: <strong>Peacock</strong>s, and some nautilus creatures. </p>
<p>The beach looks so vast and nice...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I see another Katz Box hanging on top of a large lily pad on a cliffs base.</p>
<p>Velvet points out we&#39;re looking for a malak like Bienfu. She doesn&#39;t get how Bienfu&#39;s different from Eizen or Laphicet, yet still be counted as a malak.</p>
<p>Magilou calls it &quot;a tangly mess,&quot; at best. Bienfu is open for questions.</p>
<p>Velvet asks what under Bienfu&#39;s hat? He doesn&#39;t want to tell Velvet.</p>
<p>Rokurou with a devious smile asks if he could take it off. Nope.</p>
<p>Laphicet asks &quot;why not?&quot; He can&#39;t say.</p>
<p>Bienfu mentions that he&#39;s a normin. Normin are power boosters in a way, or &quot;common spirits.&quot; Normin don&#39;t like being called by that label.</p>
<p>Eleanor finds out why Bienfu has different &quot;speaking mannerisms.&quot; Normins are trying to stand out.</p>
<p>So I am right! Bienfu is a normin malak!</p>
<p>Rokurou makes a &quot;common&quot; pun.</p>
<p>Expedition comes back, and they brought back <strong>Swimwear</strong> for Velvet!</p>
<p>I change clothes for both Velvet and Rokurou!</p>
<p>I climb a set of vines on the cliff face, going to the top of the cliff...and getting another Poison Ward!</p>
<p>We jump down, and on the other side, we see a pengyon couple on a rock warming their eggs. Eleanor calls them &quot;faithful creatures&quot; as &quot;they never leave their mate.&quot; She sighs.</p>
<p>Laphicet wonders how pengyons lay eggs. Lol...oh boy...Eleanor talks very fast about pengyons&#39; orange eggs, hoping to brush the science aside quickly! The eggs taste like &quot;sea urchins&quot; and feel like &quot;caviar.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet calls it &quot;cruel&quot; for eating pengyons&#39; eggs. You&#39;re one to talk, Velvet.</p>
<p>Eleanor has a dish that goes well with pengyon eggs: a &quot;family fricasse!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s...a horrific name...&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;I wasn&#39;t the one who named it, okay?!&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet passes on the eggs.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I found another typo on the area map. The mission calls the beach Macril Beach instead of Maclir.</p>
<p>I switch Rokurou and Velvet&#39;s outfits back.</p>
<p>In the next area, we&#39;re near another code red daemon spot!</p>
<p>In one battle, the party gets poisoned by a <strong>Dumpus!</strong></p>
<p>I come across <strong>Naga</strong>s, whose tails are venomous as well!</p>
<p>Some arte setting for Rokurou in the menu, and I head down to the sands...</p>
<p>Oh my god, Grimoirh&#39;s surrounded by lizard monsters!</p>
<p>She walks away, sighing...</p>
<p>The smaller lizard monsters scatter as a big one comes forth!</p>
<p>It&#39;s a <strong>Venom Lizard!</strong></p>
<p>Knowing he&#39;s poisonous, I take caution...</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;A dragon?&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;No, just a big lizard daemon!&quot;<br>
<strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;Is it friends with Dyle?&quot; I don&#39;t think so...</p>
<p>It poisons all party members right out of the gate!</p>
<p>This one&#39;s a toughie!</p>
<p>Its poison breath isn&#39;t to be underestimated either!</p>
<p>After a few hits, it performs its Soul Burst!</p>
<p>The lizard attempts a Body Press and walks on his hind legs now!</p>
<p>The lizard now turns red!</p>
<p>Laphicet notices.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Awwwww, he&#39;s shy!&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;More like it&#39;s angry! Let&#39;s not enrage it any further!&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s building up strength, be careful!&quot;</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Eizen switches out with Eleanor!</p>
<p>The lizard when it turns red oozes out poison gas from its body!</p>
<p>Its a long tough fight, but we manage to get him!</p>
<p>We get a <strong>Terrestrial Glacite!</strong></p>
<p>The game tells me more about higher-level Mystic Artes.</p>
<p>There&#39;s Grimoirh on a log!</p>
<p>Velvet goes to her.</p>
<p><strong>Grimoirh:</strong> (<strong>super</strong>-sighs) &quot;Who are you?&quot;</p>
<p>She looks so down...she does know Magilou and Bienfu, &quot;the outlandish pair...&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou asks how Magilou knows her: &quot;Witch training,&quot; she says. Grim&#39;s her &quot;upperclassman.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Grimoirh:</strong> &quot;Goodness, Magilou. You of all people joining a team? I didn&#39;t know you had it in you.&quot; Wait, so Magilou&#39;s a lone wolf of sorts?</p>
<p>Bienfu begs for Grim&#39;s help.</p>
<p>No can do.</p>
<p>Velvet pulls her blade in front of Grim, as an &quot;incentivizing&quot; gesture. Grim tells her to do it. My god...</p>
<p>Grim reads Velvet like a book.</p>
<p><strong>Grimoirh:</strong> &quot;Trouble follows you like a hawk follows a rabbit.&quot; You mean like a hawk follows a hare?</p>
<p>Grimoirh though doesn&#39;t want &quot;trouble.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou asks for her age.</p>
<p>Grimoirh threatens to put a firework up his butt if he asks that again! Oops! Hee...</p>
<p>Rokurou bows and apologizes for his question. It&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve seen him bow...</p>
<p>Eizen feels like they&#39;ve wasted time.</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Laphicet asks Grim how she knew how to read ancient texts. He&#39;s eager to know what&#39;s in the book.</p>
<p>Poor Laphicet. He wishes he could help Velvet even more...</p>
<p>Grimoirh offers to teach Laphicet, but at a cost. Or not. She offers to read the book for us because of Laphicet&#39;s passion.</p>
<p>Laphicet hands her the book. Grim tells him &quot;not to be so formal&quot; when he called her &quot;ma&#39;am.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s Avarost script. It&#39;ll take awhile to translate it.</p>
<p>Rokurou thinks the beach isn&#39;t the safest place to read books. He suggests going to safer ground.</p>
<p>Grim says that Rokurou &quot;redeemed&quot; himself with that idea. Yep, that&#39;s usually Rokurou. One minute, he does one thing that I really don&#39;t agree with, and then he makes up for it the next.</p>
<p>She points out <strong>Haria Village</strong> isn&#39;t far from here.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;That works. Thank you.&quot;</p>

<p>Awww, look at his smile! <img class=emojione alt=🙂 title=:slight_smile: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/1f642.png></p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s frown ruins that nice moment, though.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Skit:</strong> Eleanor asks if Grimoirh is Amenoch. No, she isn&#39;t. So Grimoirh told the shopkeeper not to sell dolls of her, even though he still thought of Grim as Amenoch. Bienfu suggests to Grim to sue him. Hee...she doesn&#39;t care. Bienfu then says likenesses of her can&#39;t sell. Uh oh...</p>
<p>She, in her &quot;casual danger&quot; tone, threatens to turn Bienfu into a doll!</p>
<p>She&#39;s <strong>definitely</strong> not the Empyrean Amenoch.</p>
<p>She calls herself a &quot;simple girl.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor accidentally insults her. Oops! She apologizes and tries verbally backspacing. She&#39;s forgiven, &quot;but it won&#39;t get her out of the doghouse.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Haria...isn&#39;t that the village with that daemon Oscar and Teresa were talking about?&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;I think it might be. We should remain on our guard.&quot;</p>
<p>A little walk later, we see the front gate of Haria Village and a save point before it.</p>
<p>I make a right before the incline to the gate and see a small tunnel on the left...</p>
<p>...leading to a gold chest that has another <strong>Garish Pink Shirt!</strong></p>
<p>I turn back and walk on the shallows to another part of the beach, where the code red daemon is!</p>
<p>I ignore her for now.</p>
<p>Back at Haria Village&#39;s gate, I save here.</p>

<p></p><h2 class=entry-title>Tales of Berseria - Part 64a: A Harpy-Go-Lucky Day</h2><p></p>

<p>I cross the shallows and head to the opposite end of the beach to face the code red here!</p>
<p>It&#39;s a <strong>Harpy-Go-Lucky</strong>, and she&#39;s weak against fire, but strong against earth and water based attacks!</p>
<p>She&#39;s surprisingly quick, but my allies get on top of her immediately!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, her Soul Break attack, a Screw Driver, knocks Rokurou out!</p>
<p>And my allies switch out members again! I&#39;m now controlling Eleanor this time!</p>
<p>With chain combos from her Burning Moon and Maelstrom arte, the tide of the battle turns!</p>
<p>Velvet makes the final blow!</p>
<p>I try to go back to Yseult, but our way back is blocked by Grimoirh&#39;s insistence that we go to Haria Village...</p>
<p>I do some level grinding, even unleashing Eleanor&#39;s Mystic Arte in one battle!</p>
<p>I save here.</p>

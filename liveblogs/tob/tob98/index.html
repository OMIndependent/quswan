<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;We&#39;ll just have to go there and see for ourselves. Which way is your village?&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s far to the east through Morgana Woods.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Skit:</strong> Phi&#39;s curious about Aball. Eizen mentions it as &quot;a fairly plain place...home to [...] hospitable folk.&quot;</p>
<p>The simple village in one go.</p>
<p>Phi wonders about Velvet&#39;s personality too. Magilou trolls Phi about Velvet&#39;s now &quot;devious and rude&quot; personality.</p>
<p>Eleanor and Phi make more on-the-nose assumptions about Velvet before she became a therion.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;And now she&#39;s the Lord of Calamity.&quot; <img class=emojione alt=â˜¹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;If she sees her former friends, maybe she&#39;ll remember of what she&#39;s lost.&quot;<br>
<strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;But what has she lost?&quot;</p>
<p>We get our first battle in Eastgand with <strong>Wolf Berserker</strong>s! Then <strong>Cliff Orc</strong>s, who look like orcs dressed up as lumberjacks!</p>
<p><strong>Blade Beak</strong>s are next! And <strong>Geo Roller</strong>s!</p>
<p>I see a geotree, but can&#39;t cross the ramp there because of the flowing water...</p>
<p>In the middle of crossing a small bridge, Rokurou asks Phi why Velvet was locked in the prison in Titania. Is it because she&#39;s a therion and she had to feed Innominat?</p>
<p>But Rokurou points out the earthpulse point, probably at those ruins. He thought it would&#39;ve been easier to leave her there. Or maybe the Shepherd didn&#39;t want the villagers getting suspicious of Velvet?</p>
<p>Magilou tells us that Velvet devoured the village. Eleanor&#39;s wondering if that tale&#39;s true. It is...</p>
<p>But how did the Shepherd cover everything up in the past three years?</p>
<p>Magilou thinks flipping Eizen&#39;s coin might help. Not really.</p>
<p>Eizen asks why Velvet was shipped to Titania if she&#39;s the &quot;first therion he created,&quot; and why he left her alive.</p>
<p>Eleanor realizes that the Shepherd was experimenting on Velvet to find out the contents of the tome. Oh my god...</p>
<p>So he tailored a &quot;special [cell] for her in the island prison, where earthpulse point and malevolence met!&quot;</p>
<p>So Velvet was used as a tool for the Shepherd. </p>
<p>Rokurou could imagine that possibility. Eleanor&#39;s in shock at the idea of the Shepherd using his own family for experimentation or as tools. First with Laphi as a sacrificial lamb, then with Velvet as a testing guinea pig. The Shepherd has fallen way far since Celica&#39;s death...</p>
<p>Eizen&#39;s speculating at this point. But I wouldn&#39;t be surprised either. It&#39;s still quite shocking, though.</p>
<p>Phi&#39;s also sad and asks why.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Perhaps that&#39;s just how badly he wants to save this world, or perhaps there&#39;s no other way it could be saved...&quot;</p>

<p>Another <strong>skit:</strong> Phi&#39;s wondering if they&#39;re going to find ruins in Eastgand. Eleanor tells him there won&#39;t be much to discover. It&#39;s not in the Abbey&#39;s records as far as she knows.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Eastgand has long been a frontier and civilization here was never really developed. Plus, the land to the east is said to be unstable, making it hard to build anything too large there.&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen mentions that the Eastgand&#39;s earth would&#39;ve destroyed any structure. He reminds us again that not many people worshipped Empyreans before the Advent.</p>
<p>Rokurou thinks they&#39;ll find a &quot;temple in the sky.&quot; Phi&#39;s brightening up at the idea!</p>
<p>Eleanor implies that&#39;s impossible.</p>
<p>Rokurou laughs, noting &quot;flying temples are a bit far-fetched.&quot;</p>
<p>I survey around the landscape, walking the ford north.</p>
<p>We jump past large stones and head near a waterfall to grab something in a chest!</p>
<p>The code red daemon here&#39;s a skunk with a tail that has some emerald green spots and green-tipped tubes at the end of their tail...that&#39;s the <strong>Dangeroma!</strong></p>
<p>The daemon&#39;s weak to fire, strong against wind, and can cast fire spells!</p>
<p>This code red daemon&#39;s a tough one!</p>
<p>I spot a Katz Box nearby!</p>
<p>I decide to run back to Taliesin to restock before moving forward!</p>
<p>After several battles, we make it to <strong>Morgana Woods, the Crimson Sea of Trees.</strong></p>
<p>I wonder, did that fog lead us into the actual Eastgand?</p>

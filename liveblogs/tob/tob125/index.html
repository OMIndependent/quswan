<p>Alright, down to the sewers we go!</p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s mentions that those angels, the Minions of Prophecy, are malakhim...</p>
<p>Eleanor knows they are Innominat&#39;s &quot;free will&quot; police, so he&#39;s doing all he can to round up any people with free will left.</p>
<p>The way Magilou puts in the word &quot;process&quot; for people who refuse to conform to Innominat&#39;s domain is just plain chilling...</p>
<p>Another <strong>skit:</strong> Phi&#39;s worried about Tabatha. But she&#39;s very strong-willed beneath that nice elderly demeanor. She&#39;s going to be fine, says Magilou, as she might find a good hiding place quick and easy.</p>
<p>Rokurou thinks that Tabatha&#39;s elderly act is also a ruse...he&#39;s joking. Rokurou, you tease...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> (to Phi) &quot;Tabatha&#39;s been living in society&#39;s shadows since before you were born. If she heard you were worried, she&#39;d laugh and say you&#39;re probably wasting your time.&quot; </p>
<p>We climb up to the villa, since it&#39;s already daytime, the lights are on in the library...</p>
<p>I read some of the books here, since I forgot to do that last time I was here. It turns out it&#39;s not only exorcists who can have malakhim...</p>
<p>There&#39;s 3000 orderlies, 100 praetors (99 now that Eleanor&#39;s out), and 3 living legates: the Shepherd is legate III, Melchior legate II, and Shigure legate V. How the heck did Shigure ever become part of the Abbey and a legate in three years?</p>
<p>I&#39;m betting Claudin is legate I.</p>
<p>Midgand Kingdom is the continent the game takes place at.</p>
<p>I read another book about resonance from a secret bookcase.</p>
<p>Now I read about the three in game rare diseases: <strong>12 Year Sickness</strong>, <strong>daemonblight</strong> (or malevolence), and <strong>Black Crystal Disease</strong>.</p>
<p>After reading about the population of Midgand, I leave the library.</p>
<p>Now into the Worship Hall...and down to the chamber where Griffin used to be...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The Prince and the girl are in the middle of a circle, in the process of losing their wills to Innominat, with the Minions of Prophecy watching...</p>
<p>Phi calls it a &quot;channeling circle&quot;.</p>
<p>Now for the Minions of Prophecy...</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;With an entrance like this, it&#39;s almost like...&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Like we&#39;re a bunch of heroes.&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Hey, no fair! You were supposed to say &#39;like what?&#39;&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet eats the circle!</p>
<p>Phi runs to the Prince. He&#39;s fine, but a bit &quot;scared out of [his] wits.&quot; The girl&#39;s mother got executed for stealing food to feed her...oh no! She&#39;s now taken in by the domain!</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;So this is the true face of their &#39;suppression&#39;.&quot;<br>
<strong>Prince:</strong> &quot;This is the ideal world sought by Shepherd Artorius. As long as malevolence gave rise to daemons, this was the only way. That&#39;s why the kingdom of Midgand consented to his plan.&quot; Without the consent of the people?!</p>
<p>The Prince is still okay, though. He&#39;s not giving into this suppression.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;<strong>A world without sadness, but also without joy. A world without hate, but also without love...</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou wonders if the entire world&#39;s become like Midgand.</p>
<p>Eizen doesn&#39;t think so. Some still have their free wills...</p>
<p>Phi senses that Innominat&#39;s domain&#39;s about to get bigger...</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Even we might be suppressed if this keeps up, and then it&#39;ll be Reason O&#39;Clock all day long.&quot;</p>
<p>Phi tells the Prince that Griffin&#39;s fine. He smiles, but he looks sad.</p>
<p><strong>Prince:</strong> &quot;Until now, I thought I was just a tool to serve my country. <strong>But when my feelings were torn from me, I felt myself want something...I understand the true horror of this ideal world now.</strong> I know it&#39;s selfish to put this burden on you [Velvet], but I beg you. <strong>Stop all this. Stop Shepherd Artorius.</strong>&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>&#39;A bird that cannot fly is no bird at all.&#39;</strong> And now I say this to you. <strong>People stripped of their feelings can never be truly alive.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Phi knows all too well.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>We&#39;re going to defeat Artorius. We&#39;re going to make this world one where we can be ourselves.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>She smiles.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>We&#39;re doing it for us. Not for you.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Technically, this is a &quot;save the world&quot; kind of quest, but it&#39;s stemming from &quot;selfish reasons.&quot; It&#39;s a nice twist.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The Prince notes Velvet&#39;s character development too. So does Tabatha.</p>
<p><strong>Tabatha:</strong> &quot;<strong>You used to be a sword, wielded by your own hatred. But now you&#39;re in control.</strong> You&#39;re the one that swings your own blade.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Even I still don&#39;t know when to sheathe it.&quot;</p>
<p>Phi vows to protect Velvet.</p>
<p>Tabatha compliments Velvet for having a dependable person by her.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Our Phi is a gallant soul.&quot;</p>
<p>Tabatha&#39;s about to tell Eizen about the captain, but that&#39;s done with.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;[The Abbey] stomped all over Aifread&#39;s pride to achieve this suppression of theirs. With these hands, I will destroy them.&quot;<br>
<strong>Tabatha:</strong> &quot;Then I&#39;m going to be selfish too, and just as another flawed human being...I will [pray] that you succeed.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s small smile, and Magilou&#39;s cheeky smile...everyone&#39;s smiling!</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Well, I&#39;m pumped. Who wants to go cut his way into that throne of theirs?&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;We can&#39;t just barge in, sword-for-brains. We gotta prepare!&quot;</p>
<p>Let&#39;s continue onto Hellawes then!</p>
<p>The Prince reminds us that the ceremony isn&#39;t finished until the Scarlet Night...hmmm...</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s time to suppress the suppression!&quot; I can&#39;t believe she&#39;s saying that...she&#39;s come so far...</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Near the gate, Rokurou asks Eleanor if she or her fellow exorcists were aware of the suppression. By her reaction, they weren&#39;t, or rather, she&#39;s trying to refuse that fact. Eizen then asks why they&#39;re submitting to the domain&#39;s power...</p>
<p>So the exorcists are also being treated like malakhim too.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Exorcists are too hard-headed to be open to much persuasion.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;If I stayed with the Abbey, I might&#39;ve accepted this world too...&quot; <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>She thanks Phi for keeping her free will. She casually gave Phi more prayers and blessings with her compliments, making him stronger.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Guess it&#39;s a good thing I captured you then.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s true. I owe you my gratitude as well. Thank you.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s taken a bit aback by the thanks. Velvet&#39;s so happy...aaaahhh!</p>
<p>Another <strong>skit:</strong> Phi asks Magilou about an arte to &quot;awaken malakhim.&quot; Other than awakening the other Empyreans, not really.</p>
<p>Phi&#39;s tempted to use the Silver Flame.</p>
<p>Magilou thinks it&#39;s a risky proposition, as he would be sacrificing himself for it.</p>
<p>Phi &quot;needs more power.&quot; Prayers and blessings are good enough.</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;I hate what the Abbey is doing. It&#39;s just wrong...this world of theirs is without any joy. I just want to do everything I can to stop them...&quot;</p>
<p>There&#39;s no arte to awaken malakhim, but Magilou, encourages him, saying that he has &quot;strength.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;There&#39;s no magic that can make it stronger.&quot;</p>
<p>Phi&#39;s getting more prayers and blessings...</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;What you need is to be ready and determined... and to be brave.&quot; When serious advice is coming from the resident troll, it&#39;s very good advice.</p>
<p>Then Magilou tells Phi to pay up.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;What do I look like, a sidewalk [therapist]? I&#39;m a witch!&quot;<br>
<strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;She always has to be so difficult...&quot;</p>

<p>Eizen charges after him, but Zaveid stops him at gunpoint! There&#39;s guns in this <em>Tales</em> game!?</p>
<p>He tells us &quot;[he&#39;s] got a date lined up.&quot;</p>
<p>The gun&#39;s originally Aifread&#39;s. </p>
<p>Eizen asks why he has it. Aifread must have dropped the gun...</p>
<p>They&#39;re almost about to fight again... <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>But Zaveid just wants to talk this time...</p>
<p><strong>Zaveid:</strong> &quot;I&#39;the like to play with you more, but I don&#39;t want to keep ol&#39; pointy beard waiting.&quot;</p>
<p>He vanishes in the wind...</p>
<p>Laphicet yells at Eizen, reminding him about the mission. Velvet&#39;s the cool head here, and we decide to go back to Reneed minus Eizen.</p>
<p><strong>Expedition check:</strong> We get a <strong>Three Meat Ragu Sauce</strong> recipe: mole, wolf, and bat meat over pasta! Eeeee...</p>
<p>We get to the village. Laphicet&#39;s curious about the gun Zaveid held. None of the crew has seen a gun before...</p>
<p>Magilou thinks the gun came from a distant continent...</p>
<p>The rest of the party wonders what&#39;s Zaveid&#39;s MO. &quot;Ol&#39; pointy beard,&quot; or Aifread, is who Zaveid might be meeting with...</p>
<p>Laphicet mentions his conversation with Benwick, and Aifread&#39;s feature of having a &quot;pointy beard.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou makes the same guess I made: Zaveid&#39;s the &quot;wanted malak&quot; the Abbey&#39;s after.</p>
<p>Eizen still went after Zaveid even though he knows it&#39;s a trap. Much like Rokurou when it comes to his brother...</p>
<p>The rain&#39;s finally stopped.</p>
<p>Some villagers are suspicious about the Abbey&#39;s secret missions...</p>
<p>One soldier and merchant mention how Lothringen was found, excavated by malakhim under orders by Legate Melchior. There were malakhim hibernating underground!?</p>
<p>The herbalist doesn&#39;t want any trouble from us. Oh well...</p>
<p>I do more business at the weapon shop.</p>
<p>I collect the reward for fighting the code red daemon in the Warg Forest.</p>
<p>We see a stack of frogs staring at the sea...Magilou makes up a poem from the frogs. Two haikus, to be exact...</p>
<p>Magilou mentions her gambling past...where she lost all her winnings.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;I think we can call that &#39;poetic justice.&#39;&quot;</p>
<p>At the port, an erudite merchant mentions that Westgand is slowly moving north, and Northgand and Westgand will become one continent! No Vortigern needed.</p>

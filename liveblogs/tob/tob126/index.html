<p>From reading the map, we can now collect a <strong>Blue Nor Doll</strong> in Haria Village...</p>
<p>We sail to Yseult first!</p>
<p>Everyone seems to be okay so far...</p>
<p>The Suppression&#39;s spread here too...</p>
<p>In the tavern, some people have resisted the suppression, at least. One informant tells us a venomized daemon has been spotted in Palamedes...</p>
<p>Then, a skit plays where Magilou and Velvet have more talk over a snack. Rokurou wants more daemons to fight...</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;To feed or not to feed? That is the question.&quot;</p>
<p>The venomized daemon is also on the Code Red list too: it&#39;s a <strong>Gluttony</strong>, or a daemon slime!</p>
<p>By the size of the bounty, it&#39;s not pretty tough!</p>
<p>One merchant in an inn thinks the suppression is another calamity. If he knew that the Abbey was behind this...</p>
<p>I warp to Haria Village. The place is sunny, but there&#39;s no one around anymore...</p>
<p>I find the blue nor doll on the ground behind the weapon stall...so we have a <strong>black</strong>, <strong>red</strong>, and now a <strong>blue</strong> doll...</p>
<p>A <strong>skit</strong> plays: Magilou wonders when a Turtlez will show up.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;You mean the Turtlez is late because he&#39;s taking too much time getting a new design for his robe?&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen writes letters to his sister as &quot;apology&quot; letters since he&#39;s not able to visit her.</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;But you can&#39;t go home because of the Reaper&#39;s Curse, right? So why do you need to send letters and gifts?&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;My sister wrote a letter. She said, &#39;I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s dangerous, I want to be with you.&#39;&quot;</p>
<p>So, ever since he became one of Aifread&#39;s pirates, he hasn&#39;t returned home. He&#39;s still thinking there&#39;s hope to undo the curse. But if even he did, he&#39;s found his home with Aifread&#39;s crew.</p>
<p>Eizen knows his sister&#39;s probably aware of that too.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;She&#39;s smart and she&#39;s empathetic. That&#39;s why she never sends me a reply...I think she [also] doesn&#39;t reply as a way of showing that she disapproves.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou thinks those letters are to make up for Eizen not being there.</p>
<p>Velvet thinks they&#39;re making it harder on themselves and tells them why not face each other. Yikes, she&#39;s so direct...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;At least the person you care about is still alive!&quot;</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I head for the reef next, where I meet a Katz. He wants us to fish up some fish for him. I read the rules.</p>
<p>There&#39;s also a Big One in every fishing area we can catch for a big reward!</p>
<p>I try my hand at some fishing attempts as an excuse to waste the fishing bait...and I eventually catch a Big One, or a <strong>Coral Colored Giant Oarfish!</strong></p>
<p>Heading to the Palamedes Temple, the soldiers and malakhim are here...and the miasma&#39;s gone!</p>
<p>The venomized slime daemon probably ate up the malevolence and the daemons!</p>
<p>The slime daemon&#39;s also brought friends too, three, no five Slimes!</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s the daemon-eating daemon!&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;The more it eats, the more ferocious it gets, right?&quot;</p>
<p>We win a <strong>Survivor&#39;s Ventite!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;It devoured other daemons purely by instinct...sounds kind of like me, doesn&#39;t it?&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;...when you&#39;re hungry, you eat.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s fine... I don&#39;t really care if I&#39;m seen as a bad guy.&quot; At least she&#39;s honest about herself.</p>
<p>Phi mentions that the daemon wanted to live...</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;It was powerful and frightening, but I don&#39;t think it was bad.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> (smiles) &quot;Figures.&quot; Oh Phi, he always sees the good in everyone.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>

<p>I return to Lionel Island, where the entire crew&#39;s gathered looking at the sea...mourning their Captain... <img class=emojione alt=😔 title=:pensive: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/1f614.png></p>
<p>Everyone&#39;s laughing and drinking to their captain.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;This turned to be a pretty lively memorial.&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;<strong>To death, we are as equals. It comes to us all. There&#39;s no reason to treat it as something special.</strong>&quot; Yikes, Magilou&#39;s uncharacteristically somber...</p>
<p>Eizen agrees with her point.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Wherever we sail, death is lurking beneath the waves.&quot;</p>
<p>They have to be prepared for even the worst, Phi... <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Eleanor decides to give him a prayer, even though &quot;he&#39;s the most terrible villain in a hundred years,&quot; according to Eizen.</p>
<p>Velvet suggests Eizen&#39;s friends.</p>
<p>Eizen makes a eulogy to Captain Aifread.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;<strong>I was enriched by the days sailing with you than the centuries I roamed in search of something to end my curse. Thanks for the fun, Aifread.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>I get an <strong>outfit</strong> for Eizen!</p>
<p>The coat and his undershirt are now red...and his metallic buttons are now golden...</p>
<p>I check around the marsh for anything I missed, even visiting the places where Teresa, Oscar, and Aifread passed away...</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>At Taliesin, some are affected by the suppression, others not so much...</p>
<p>It&#39;s the same at Reneed. Videl&#39;s still at a doctor getting a check up about his fever...</p>
<p>The pioneer and his son are fighting off the suppression...their stubborn wills are probably pushing it back.</p>
<p>Now for Islegand and Cadnix Isle...the people at the port are also affected. The ones who aren&#39;t are trying to wake their friends up.</p>
<p>I head into the mines, and go to the ravine, for more fishing and treasures! I catch a <strong>Pearl-Colored Arowana!</strong></p>
<p>Now we&#39;re off to Northgand!</p>

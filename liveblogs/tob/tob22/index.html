<p>Now that the malak&#39;s with us, he gains two new titles...</p>
<p>The malak&#39;s looking at the sea...</p>
<p>There&#39;s Magilou at the head, complimenting Velvet on the awesomeness of the plan and leaving Hellawes portless for now. She&#39;s still wondering if Hellawes will recover from that...</p>
<p>Velvet asks Magilou how much info she spilled to the exorcists.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou&#39;s response:</strong> &quot;I just started Episode 2: <strong>&#39;Magilouâ€™s Fury!&#39; Wherein the Beautiful Witch is Captured and Tortured by a Daemon Most Cruel!</strong>&quot; My god, that exaggerated episode title is too funny, and the delivery of her lines too...</p>
<p>Even Magilou mentions her next episode in the works: &quot;Magilou and the Tears of the Demon Lord!&quot; It&#39;s like she&#39;s living in her own anime...</p>
<p>Velvet wants to set course for the capital Loegres. Dyle suggests they need more crewmembers if they&#39;re going to get there safely...</p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s pondering something looking at the sky or the sails...</p>
<p>He says the same thing that Dyle suggests: more crewmembers and &quot;to tie down the cargo.&quot;</p>
<p>He&#39;s also unfurled the sails as well. He&#39;s unsure if the knot he tied is tight at this point...</p>
<p>Rokurou says he&#39;s good at cutting things, but tying isn&#39;t his forte. If Rokurou were to be given a Gordian Knot, he&#39;d cut it immediately.</p>
<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> I can relate to Rokurou a bit when it comes to tying things too...I worry whether my laces would come loose at any moment and they sometimes do.</p>
<p>I have Velvet talk to the malak last. I breathe in and out before going to him, knowing Velvet&#39;s reaction...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>She looks at him with a terrible face.</p>
<p>Dyle (or Rokurou?) ask Velvet about the heading. She can&#39;t read the compass...I can&#39;t read compasses either, or at least I try to...</p>
<p>The child malak tells Velvet she&#39;s holding the compass wrong. He adds that it&#39;s meant to move alongside the ship&#39;s movement.</p>
<p>Velvet holds the compass steady at the base.</p>
<p>She asks the malak about his real name. He has no real name, he says.</p>
<p>Velvet asks him to hold the compass. His answer and the exchange below is a bit heartbreaking...</p>
<p><strong>Malak:</strong> &quot;If that&#39;s an order.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;I&#39;m asking you what you want.&quot;<br>
<strong>Malak:</strong> &quot;So you&#39;re ordering me to answer?&quot;</p>
<p>Now Velvet gets to the heart of the matter of the malak&#39;s purpose: as tools. Velvet &quot;orders [him] to shut his mouth.&quot;</p>
<p>The ship hits something!</p>
<p>The compass drops into the ocean!</p>
<p>Pirates! What is this, <strong>Assassin&#39;s Creed, IV</strong>!?</p>
<p>So Aifread&#39;s crew attacking, huh?</p>
<p>Magilou states the obvious. Their ship&#39;s not armed!</p>
<p>Velvet orders a debark at the nearest shore to fight the pirates!</p>
<p>A blond pretty pirate, their captain (?) comes forth, and points out that most of Velvet&#39;s crew are daemons...</p>
<p>Velvet orders the malak to &quot;wipe them out.&quot;</p>
<p>The captain (?) backs away and says that he&#39;s not going to fight them.</p>
<p>Then, a man in a dark coat with what sort of looks like the Batman logo on his back steps forward.</p>

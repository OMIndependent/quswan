<p>There&#39;s Orthie and Russ near the fireplace...</p>
<p>We head inside the room, where Medissa and Kamoana are talking.</p>
<p>Kamoana thanks Eleanor for curing her fever, and asks us something.</p>
<p><strong>Kamoana:</strong> &quot;I want you to open my treasure chest with me!&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor asks what&#39;s in the chest.</p>
<p>Medissa tells us it&#39;s a secret.</p>
<p><strong>Kamoana:</strong> &quot;...a really, reeeeeeeaaaaally important treasure!&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;m interested. She considers it very important to her.</p>
<p>Eleanor asks her where it is.</p>
<p><strong>Kamoana:</strong> &quot;On some ice...floating out in the sea...and you can&#39;t open it without the key.&quot;</p>
<p>Kamoana put the key inside Dyle&#39;s pocket.</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s not too comfortable at the idea...I chuckle a bit.</p>
<p><strong>Kamoana:</strong> &quot;What else was I supposed to do? It&#39;s a secret key!&quot;</p>
<p>We find Dyle at the port of town.</p>
<p>Dyle&#39;s not too happy at being a lizard because of the cold weather...</p>
<p>Eleanor tells him not to move and searches him. I&#39;m now taking Velvet&#39;s side at this point.</p>
<p>There&#39;s no key on him.</p>
<p>Dyle dropped it.</p>
<p>Kamoana thought that he would bite any intruders taking the key. Dyle apologizes.</p>
<p>Velvet asks where he dropped the key. Dyle thinks he may have heard something metallic while &quot;drying [his] shirt back at the inn.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Wait, when it was drying? Don&#39;t you know how to check your pockets before you do the wash?&quot; Is she giving this question to everyone who forgets to take out their loose change?</p>
<p>Dyle says he&#39;s a &quot;bachelor.&quot;</p>
<p>We see something shining near one of the dogs sitting in the fireplace.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>It&#39;s the key!</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;You said the chest was floating on an iceberg, right? I&#39;d say that&#39;s our next stop.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet tells Kamoana not to drop the key. The description of the key reminds us &quot;to check [our] pockets before washing [our] clothes.&quot;</p>
<p>There&#39;s the chest! But it&#39;s almost sinking...</p>
<p><strong>Kamoana:</strong> &quot;It opened! It opened!&quot;<br>
<strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;Good job, Kamoana!&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet wants to know what&#39;s in the chest.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Don&#39;t you remember? It&#39;s supposed to be a secret!&quot;<br>
<strong>Kamoana:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s one of my mom&#39;s recipes!&quot;</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p><strong>Kamoana:</strong> &quot;She wrote it down for me so that I could fix it myself when I got older.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s almost weeping.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;That sounds really precious...are you sure you want to share it with us?&quot;</p>
<p>Kamoana says yes, acknowledging it&#39;s a secret family recipe.</p>
<p><strong>Kamoana:</strong> &quot;But...you all saved me when I needed you, and I really want to thank you, so...it&#39;s okay. Thanks everyone!&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;You&#39;re welcome, Kamoana.&quot;<br>
<strong>Kamoana:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s a recipe for mabo curry that my mom came up with just for me! It&#39;s the best in the whole...wide...world!&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet has stars in his eyes once he heard &quot;mabo curry!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Kamoana:</strong> &quot;You go out there and win! Medissa and me&#39;ll be cheering you on!&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Yeah, I won&#39;t back down. I promise.&quot;</p>
<p>We get the recipe for a <strong>Mabo Curry Bun!</strong> Yessss! It&#39;s Mabo Curry in a bao!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we don&#39;t have the tofu to make it!</p>
<p>We now have <strong>25</strong> recipes out of <strong>30!</strong></p>

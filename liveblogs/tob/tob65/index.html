<p><strong>Skit:</strong> After hearing about the daemonblight, Rokurou&#39;s a bit surprised at the laidback feel of Haria Village.</p>
<p>Eleanor guesses the locals are being nice because we have an exorcist in tow.</p>
<p>Velvet has a small smile while pondering and observes Eleanor&#39;s awareness of gray morality.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> (condescendingly?) &quot;The Abbey wouldn&#39;t entrust my responsibilities to someone who couldn&#39;t see beyond the surface.&quot;</p>
<p>She&#39;s seen the good, great, bad, and ugly...but all that she&#39;s seen makes her more motivated, not less.</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s an optimist. She sees the darkness in Velvet. Velvet&#39;s surprised at her forward manner.</p>
<p>My lord, that&#39;s a beautiful sunset...</p>
<p>I scour around for treasures, like Mussels and a Dark Bottle.</p>
<p>At the entrance to the inn, I see a Katz Box around the side. This time I get <strong>White Bunny Ears</strong> as a reward!</p>
<p>I put them on Rokurou...</p>
<p>Three villagers are debating whether to let the Abbey in or to keep worshipping Amenoch.</p>
<p>I shop awhile. The Amphibole equipment&#39;s rather pricey.</p>

<hr>
<p>There&#39;s a boy hiding behind a natant tree near a red herb. </p>
<p>He&#39;s not too fond of fruit-flavored gels. So, he decided to make chocolate gels! I wonder if they&#39;re useful in battle...plus, now I&#39;m thinking of eating that gel irl.</p>
<p>Other people thought the idea not &quot;avant-garde&quot; enough. He then put bonito fish into chocolate gels. I think cocoa gels are good enough alone.</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s thinks mixing fish with chocolate is odd.</p>
<p>Rokurou agrees with the idea of &quot;braising meat with chocolate,&quot; since they go good together. His sweet tooth is kicking in again.</p>
<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> What Rokurou says is true. Meat and chocolate are good together, but it depends on how the chocolate is used. Plus, I&#39;ve seen recipes that used chocolate in chicken...</p>
<p>The boy thought the chocolate and fish was a &quot;bad,&quot; but &quot;interesting&quot; combo. Rokurou asks the boy why he&#39;s angry if he&#39;s made a great discovery. He &quot;outdid&quot; himself, he says.</p>
<p>He now plans to put chocolate gels in toilets, calling it &quot;The Great Choconito Gambit&quot;! This is too funny!</p>
<p>Laphicet finds his idea funny too.</p>
<p><strong>Boy:</strong> &quot;I don&#39;t want to become the kind of grown-up who can&#39;t find any fun in looking for gels in toilets.&quot; Wait a minute, it took me awhile to get the gels-in-toilet reference...</p>

<p>We head to the inn to rest up.</p>
<p>Grimoirh now starts to translate the book. Laphicet asks if he could watch the process. Grimoirh&#39;s not impressed at being called &quot;teacher.&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet thinks it&#39;s better than &quot;ma&#39;am.&quot; </p>
<p>She smiles and decides to teach him! Phew...</p>
<p>I&#39;m now outside the inn. I talk to a few locals mentioning their debate over whether to let the Abbey in or not.</p>
<p>So Amenoch the Empyrean has priestesses, or used to be, but it&#39;s now a mother and daughter left.</p>
<p>The Abbey also took over Amenoch&#39;s Temple...Velvet asks if they forced it over. So Teresa wanted Amenoch&#39;s temple. But for what? To force Haria to worship Innominat.</p>
<p>My god, this is religious imperialism right here.</p>
<p>But where is the priestess?</p>
<p>The priestessâ€™s name is <strong>Mahina</strong>.</p>
<p>Amenoch worshippers aren&#39;t happy <strong>Palamedes</strong>, the temple of Amenoch, is being taken over by the Abbey. But the daemonblight isn&#39;t helping.</p>
<p>Velvet wonders why the Abbey would need Palamedes for?</p>
<p>It&#39;s the end of an era for Haria Village.</p>
<p>Magilou points out the Abbey&#39;s ruthless oppression.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;I&#39;d imagine that comes part and parcel with spreading the good word. Other gods would get in the way.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Palamedes Temple</strong> is now the Abbey HQ in Southgand.</p>
<p>Velvet doesn&#39;t find a lot of &quot;reason&quot; in taking over a temple.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Unless... do you think they need it for some other purpose?&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> (actually says this) &quot;Shrug.&quot;</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>There&#39;s Eizen sitting on the grass, looking at the beach...</p>
<p>Eizen points out reading old Avarost isn&#39;t just reading grammar and words. It&#39;s more of &quot;kind of [having] to intuit the words [a lot].&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>A language based on guesswork? Thanks, old, dead people. You&#39;re officially the worst.</strong>&quot; Lol. That&#39;s the funniest line in this game so far.</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s still thinking about the connections between the daemon and the village. She thinks there might have been an epidemic, but the village looks okay...</p>
<p>Velvet thinks as long as the Abbey isn&#39;t pursuing them then that&#39;s good enough.</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s not too keen on Velvet&#39;s &quot;do and use anything and everything to get what she wants&quot; approach.</p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s looking at the weapons on the rack...</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;So she digs being called &#39;teacher.&#39; Well played, Laphicet.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;You can tell how badly he wanted to help her...I think [Laphicet&#39;s] finally finding himself.&quot;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Grim&#39;s deciphering the book, with Laphicet at Grim&#39;s side.</p>
<p><strong>Grimoirh:</strong> &quot;Oh, ancient Avarost. You have the obstinacy of a spurned lover who refuses to move on.&quot;</p>
<p>There&#39;s a line that Grim can&#39;t figure out, which literally reads as: &quot;<strong>The parent hates tomatoes; the child, eggplants.</strong>&quot; N abq gb <em>Flzcubavn</em>? Bar bs gur punenpgref va gung tnzr vf abg n sna bs gbzngbrf.</p>
<p>So reading ancient Avarost is like reading a riddle wrapped in an enigma cuddled in an <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness>NP-complete problem</a>.</p>
<p>Laphicet sort of solves the book&#39;s abstract puzzle.</p>
<p>&quot;Pochomusan&quot; in ancient Avarost, within the context of the passage they&#39;re reading, translates to &quot;The Nameless Empyrean.&quot; <strong>Innominat.</strong></p>
<p>Grim thinks this is a book of children&#39;s counting songs.</p>
<p>But the song in the book, according to Grim, Laphicet would find interesting.</p>

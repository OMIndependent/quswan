<p>I got tempted to read the guide to check the Recipes List in this game, and there&#39;s 30 of them total...</p>
<p>I wonder how we could get those recipes? Maybe we could ask Benwick to scout for more treasures and hopefully he&#39;ll get us one.</p>
<p>Before I do that, a Katz holding small balloons catch my eye...</p>
<p>They have minigames called <strong>Chamballoon</strong> and <strong>Slash Beat</strong>. I listen to the rules for both games. The first minigame is similar to a shooting gallery but is considered like a regular battle. With the second minigame, I have to do as much damage as I can within a time limit.</p>
<p>Depending on my performance on those minigames, I get Tales coins, which I can trade for certain prizes.</p>
<p>I use Laphicet for Slash Beat and I win 36 Tales coins!</p>
<p>Now for Rokurou for Chamballoon! I win more Tales coins, and a <strong>Void Normin Set</strong> for Velvet for beating it!</p>
<p>The Void Normin mascot is cute...</p>
<p>More tries at those minigames again...</p>
<p>After getting some rewards, we move on...</p>
<p>If the Aifread crew knows we&#39;re in trouble, they will &quot;sail to the rescue,&quot; even if they&#39;re on land. Hee...</p>
<p>The Abbey&#39;s <strong>really</strong> got a tight grip on when the ships set sail. They use Vortigern to enforce what goes in and out of Midgand. The sailor, as per usual, says &quot;it&#39;s necessary&quot; because of daemons and pirates out at sea. My god...</p>
<p>No ships are sailing from Hellawes...</p>
<p>We get our first Sugar from a sack and find another Katz box! This one needs 75 spirits to open it!</p>
<p>Not even gambling&#39;s allowed under the Abbey&#39;s watch...</p>
<p>From a merchant we find out the <em>Van Eltia</em>&#39;s registered as the <em>Van Valvali</em>, and from rumors, he says pirates might own the ship...Aifread&#39;s crew&#39;s hiding in plain sight.</p>
<p>More praise for the exorcists again...</p>
<p>Two women talk about the <em>Van Eltia</em>&#39;s crew. One of them&#39;s a bit creeped out by Eizen&#39;s glare...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>One merchant says that another crew led by Marcus, one of the Pirate Kings, was taken out by other pirates, and only Aifread&#39;s left to stand up to the Royal Navy.</p>
<p>That merchant is the liaison between Aifread and the Abbey, I&#39;m guessing.</p>
<p>We speak to some guards. The only way to Loegres for the ceremony is by the south road.</p>
<p>Merchants are talking about the awesomeness of crabs and their anatomy now. Laphicet mentions the proper term: autotomy. </p>
<p>Another merchant calls another a &quot;bro,&quot; and Rokurou&#39;s tempted to sell Dyle&#39;s tails for a good price after mentioning that lizard tails can regenerate. </p>
<p>Laphicet asks if they&#39;re tasty. Velvet&#39;s disgusted by the idea of eating lizard tails...</p>
<p>The merchant then makes a &quot;pinching&quot; pun about crabs.</p>
<p>A woman, who&#39;s traveled far from home with her husband, is super excited to meet &quot;the Savior of the World.&quot; She&#39;s even crying!</p>
<p>We get some <strong>Legendary Doubanjiang</strong> in a pot...it&#39;s used for Mabo Curry Buns. Hmmm...</p>
<p>Almost everyone&#39;s excited for the ceremony. Too bad it&#39;s going to be ruined by us...</p>
<p>The weapons merchant here&#39;s selling Calcite equipment. We take the lot!</p>
<p>More info about a temple being built north of the nearby highway, but it&#39;s only for Abbey members...the woman calls them &quot;selfish.&quot;</p>
<p>After a few weapon enhancements, I read the synopsis. I chuckle a bit at Rokurou being &quot;an amicable guy.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou even asks what &quot;Laphicet&quot; means in the synopsis. Velvet gives him the &quot;it&#39;s a trade secret&quot; line.</p>
<p>At the inn, there&#39;s a family from Hellawes who came all the way to Midgand to see the ceremony.</p>
<p>There&#39;s even people from Yseult (Izoold?) coming to see the ceremony.</p>
<p>The sailor in the inn&#39;s heard about Titania. Velvet and Rokurou confirm his rumors, except for &quot;people not breaking out of there alive.&quot; Eizen &quot;persuades&quot; the sailor to not say a word about the crew as escaped prisoners.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>After a rest-and-save, it&#39;s time to talk to Benwick about the scouting ship. He says that the crew&#39;s exploring to make a map of the entire world...Laphicet and Rokurou are super interested. Velvet and Magilou don&#39;t get why Aifread&#39;s crew is doing that.</p>
<p>Eizen explains how we could do that. In addition, we could get more treasures, or &quot;food, or brand new recipes!&quot; Yes!</p>
<p>I now get a new menu option: <strong>expedition!</strong> I go through the tutorial...and have the scout ship explore the Leymon Sea!</p>
<p>It&#39;s pretty quick!</p>
<p>And that&#39;s it for the tutorial!</p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s all smiles and excitement at the idea of finding new stuff! Laphicet&#39;s excited about the places the ship finds! Eizen&#39;s open to new shortcuts...Velvet doesn&#39;t care. Magilou&#39;s excited to eat more types of fish. She even mentions yellowtail...lol...</p>
<p>Time to head out, but guards have sighted a powerful daemon in the highway! They label them as a &quot;code red daemon&quot;, meaning they&#39;re on the most wanted list. We <strong>cannot</strong> be unprepared when we face a &quot;code red daemon.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Skit:</strong> Eizen asks about what Velvet knows about Aifread on the prison island. </p>
<p>Magilou gives info about that: he was taken about a year ago, and was considered to be a very important prisoner by the way the Abbey took him out of the prison. Plus, he&#39;s only a human....</p>
<p>My god, he must have something the Abbey wants...</p>
<p>We leave Port Zekson, wary of the Abbey&#39;s tight enforcement in Midgand.</p>

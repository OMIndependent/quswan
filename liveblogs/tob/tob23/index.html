<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p><strong>It&#39;s him!!</strong></p>
<p>The malak throws his paper at him, and spiky rocks burst out in front of him!</p>
<p>Velvet sees that that man is a malak!</p>
<p><strong>Malak Pirate:</strong> &quot;<strong>No. I&#39;m the reaper.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>It seems we have three in our party now to challenge him!</p>
<p>He&#39;s strong against water...</p>
<p>I look at the malak&#39;s artes. He has <strong>First Aid</strong>, another <em>Tales</em> staple! Along with a lot of elemental spells!</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Who is this guy?&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;A malak pirate?&quot;<br>
<strong>Malak Pirate:</strong> &quot;A sword, twin blades, and paper...no pendulum that I can see...&quot; What pendulum is he talking about?</p>
<p>Now at half health, what is the Malak Pirate&#39;s next move?</p>
<p><strong>Malak Pirate:</strong> &quot;You pass the test. Join us.&quot;</p>
<p>What!? What test!?</p>
<p>The malak pirate knew about Hellawes&#39;s port getting razed!</p>
<p>The malak pirate doesn&#39;t mince words, and warns Velvet&#39;s crew that if they hadn&#39;t stopped them, they would&#39;ve been headed for the <strong>Gate of Vortigern</strong>...</p>
<p>Before heading to Midgand, we have to pass through something called &quot;the Narrows.&quot;</p>
<p>The number one pirate tells the crew about a &quot;massive fortress...with a tremendous gate&quot; that Midgand has built up to defend itself from naval attacks...</p>
<p>Rokurou thanks them.</p>
<p>Oh my goodness, there&#39;s always another obstacle, isn&#39;t there?</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The pirate malak also wants to go there too, but needs more hands on deck. He suggests teaming up with Velvet and crew.</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s skeptical. She&#39;s smart enough not to trust a pirate...</p>
<p>The pirate malak&#39;s serious about the Gate. He walks past Velvet&#39;s crew...</p>
<p>Magilou asks if they can refuse to listen to him.</p>
<p><strong>Malak Pirate:</strong> &quot;Your business is your business, and ours is ours. There&#39;s nothing more to say.&quot;</p>
<p>So the malak pirate is the first mate...the pretty blond pirate with the hat asks if they can join him.</p>
<p>He tells him he&#39;ll get in the way.</p>
<p>So their ship is called the <em>Van Eltia</em>, huh?</p>
<p>Where is he going in that cave?</p>
<p>We get a new ventite and an accesory: an eyepatch fit for a pirate!</p>
<p>The ventite invites additional enemies to join battle based on the difficulty level of the game...uh oh...</p>
<p>The game puts up more pointers about malak artes. In a way, they&#39;re like actual spellcasters in that their artes take time to cast...</p>
<p>It also tells us about <strong>dire foes</strong>, which join a fight depending on our battle performance, difficulty level, and by how much fighting I did in one area...</p>

<p>After a few weeks off, I&#39;m back!</p>
<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> For context, I didn&#39;t start this session until almost two weeks after Part 162.</p>
<p>After a few battles, I head back to Stonebury, where two exorcists talk to each other.</p>
<p>They mention Hexen Isle, &quot;taking out a dragon&quot;, and the Calix. They&#39;re under orders from the Shepherd!?</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;There&#39;s a dragon on Hexen Isle?&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Perhaps the one that was caught in the Calix got loose?&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen thinks it&#39;s the same dragon (Silva). Laphicet thinks so too.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Reign it in, kiddo. That dragon is bad news.&quot;</p>
<p>She would rather leave the dragon alone.</p>
<p>Laphicet looks down. He mentions all the time that they had together was completely void of &quot;feeling and free thought.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;We were just...there. If you&#39;d taken him with you instead of me, I&#39;d probably have turned into a dragon by now myself.&quot; <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Laphicet considers &quot;[wanting] him to be at peace.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s your funeral.&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen, Eleanor, and Rokurou jump in.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Everyone deserves closure!&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou, on the other hand...</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Oh, to be young and fearless... you do realize if we lose, there won&#39;t even be any dental records left to identify us by?&quot;</p>
<p>We faced off against Phoenix and Theodora, I think this dragon might be as hard or easier than those two...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We head for Hexen Isle.</p>
<p>The save point here is near the geotree...</p>
<p>I circle around and find the geotree for this isle.</p>
<p>I also notice the Hellkite dragon beyond, roaming the large plateau ahead...</p>
<p>The monsters here are <strong>Gale Witch</strong>, <strong>Rigid Python</strong>, <strong>Curse Island Giant</strong>, <strong>Macrotian Wraith</strong>, and <strong>Enticing Glamor</strong>.</p>
<p>If this place wasn&#39;t so secret, this might be a good place for a picnic.</p>
<p>I get a pair of <strong>Satan&#39;s Wrath Earrings</strong> from a west passage at the north end of the canyon here.</p>
<p>Turning back, I find a Katz Box behind a rock, and rescue the guy in there!</p>
<p>I ascend up to the field where the Hellkite is, and keep my way out of his range and go east and north, collecting another Elixir.</p>
<p>I face him now...</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Oh come on, give us a break already! I bet even Innominat couldn&#39;t stop this thing!&quot; I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s the case too. He doesn&#39;t <strong>want</strong> to stop this dragon.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Then this&#39;ll be the perfect warmup!&quot;</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The Hellkite glows red...</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Am I just imagining things...or does he look like he&#39;s even stronger?&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen explains he&#39;s probably eating the malevolence produced from around the Calix and the island.</p>
<p>Velvet tells Laphicet he can back out of this, knowing fighting a dragon &quot;is no joke.&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet goes to him.</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Silva... I used you so I could escape. But this time, I won&#39;t run away!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;You&#39;re going down, Silva!&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;No tricks! Just a straight up battle!&quot;</p>
<p>This dragon has the same weaknesses and strengths as before...</p>
<p>And the same tricks, especially his Neigh, which stuns everyone!</p>
<p>At half health, he unleashes his <strong>Calamity Flare!</strong></p>
<p>A few minutes later, an unblockable Meteor Storm!</p>
<p>I read his stats, and he has an Iron Stance ability! This version, however, only interrupts his spells after 20 hits on him!</p>
<p>After one final Meteor Storm from him, the dragon&#39;s finished, and with a flash, turns into bones!</p>
<p>Laphicet walks over to the dragon&#39;s remains...and kneels...</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Phi?&quot;<br>
<strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;I just remembered something...One time when Lady Teresa was punishing me, Silva stood right by my side, just like this. He didn&#39;t say a word, but his presence was a comfort...Sorry, Silva. And Velvet?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;Back at Hellawes...thanks for taking me with you and getting me out of there.&quot; <img class=emojione alt=😢 title=:cry: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/1f622.png><br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> (embarrassed) &quot;...That was basically kidnapping, really.&quot;<br>
<strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;Maybe but I want to thank you all the same.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;You don&#39;t have to, Phi. Really. You&#39;ve come a long way. That&#39;s because you put in the effort, not me.&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou looks around.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;This sensation...is the Calix still functional?&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou thinks our task is finished in the island. Magilou doesn&#39;t seem to think so. I agree with her for once.</p>
<p>Magilou&#39;s thinking about the Calix now that Melchior&#39;s out of the picture...only the Shepherd himself controls the Calix now.</p>
<p>She laughs off her thought, and leaves with the rest of the party.</p>
<p>The dragon&#39;s bones are still there...eee...</p>
<p>We get a <strong>Color Variant Outfit</strong> for Laphicet as a prize for finishing the dragon, it&#39;s all green-and-white...</p>
<p>I head west and into a narrow passageway, where a code red daemon is...</p>
<p>The code red daemon&#39;s an armored daemon...he&#39;s not gigantic, he&#39;s slightly shorter than or around the same height as Rokurou.</p>
<p>I take caution, though...</p>
<p>This code red is the <strong>Demon Rodler</strong>, who&#39;s weak against wind, but strong against earth and non-elemental attacks.</p>
<p>The Demon Rodler also has <strong>Dark Fangs</strong> as part of his spellset...along with many others!</p>
<p>We eventually take care of the code red!</p>

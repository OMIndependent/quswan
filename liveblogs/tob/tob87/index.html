<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>We make it to the summit again!</p>
<p>There&#39;s the dragon daemon!</p>
<p>His red eye glows malevolently, and he&#39;s exuding a ton of malevolence.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;It looks so deadly...and just check out how much malevolence it&#39;s putting out.&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Which means it&#39;s not a therion.&quot; Boooo!</p>
<p>Velvet suggests falling back.</p>
<p>But Eizen wants a fight with the dragon. Oh god no...</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Fighting this creature is a good way to end up dead.&quot; For some reason, Velvet looks a bit...annoyed? Eleanor apologizes.</p>
<p>Oh darn...</p>
<p>The dragon&#39;s name is <strong>Shenlong!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Dammit, this wasn&#39;t part of the plan!&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Yeah, but training like this doesn&#39;t come around every day!&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Be on your guard! One wrong move and you&#39;re done for!&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;I know! That&#39;s the fun part!&quot; Oh, Rokurou...</p>
<p>After taking a chunk of the dragon&#39;s health, I&#39;m now treated to a cutscene of the party trying to fight back!</p>
<p>Eizen puts up his dukes and lunges forward...</p>
<p>...and Zaveid intervenes!</p>
<p>Eizen punches him out of the way!</p>
<p><strong>Zaveid:</strong> &quot;...You knew. Didn&#39;t you, Eizen?&quot;</p>
<p>Zaveid defends Shenlong!</p>
<p><strong>Zaveid:</strong> &quot;<strong>She&#39;s not a dragon!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Zaveid puts Siegfried to his head. He&#39;s going to empower himself with more mana...</p>
<p>But Shenlong uses her tail to swing him out of the way, and flees!</p>
<p>So Zaveid and Shenlong have a history together, huh?</p>
<p>Eizen asks if she&#39;s someone Zaveid knew. He does not like her being called a dragon.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;So it seems ol&#39; Check-Out-My-Pecs and the dragon have some kinda close ties.&quot; Check-Out-My-Pecs, heh...</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s not laughing.</p>
<p>Phi asks about the connection between Zaveid and the dragon.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;When malakhim are tainted by malevolence... a dragon is what ultimately results.&quot; Just like the lancer malak back in Titania. Velvet&#39;s gaze confirms it in my eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;So you&#39;re saying that dragon was a malak Zaveid once knew?!&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;She must be who he was praying for back in town...&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou asks if malakhim exude malevolence like humans. No Rokurou, they don&#39;t. Grim or Eizen might have told us that before in Southgand.</p>
<p>Eizen repeats what he said: Overexposure to malevolence from humans or daemons will turn malakhim into dragons.</p>
<p>So Laphicet almost felt malevolence take ahold of him in the earthpulse after the Empyrean&#39;s Throne.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;The air there was thick with malevolence being sent on its way to Innominat.&quot;<br>
<strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;If I&#39;d stayed there, I might be a dragon too.&quot; Thank goodness that fate was averted.</p>
<p>Eleanor asks Eizen if having a vessel can prevent malakhim from becoming dragons.</p>
<p>It lessens the risks, but doesn&#39;t completely take it off. And another part I found important here...</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;<strong>By stripping their malakhim of consciousness, the Abbey exorcists seem to be able to inhibit the transformation.</strong> But nothing in this world is guaranteed.&quot; The lancer malak at Titania proves that.</p>
<p>Velvet asks if a dragon can be turned back. Not a chance.</p>
<p>Eleanor asks if a part of the malak is still there in the dragon. None.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;But Zaveid won&#39;t kill it. Must be his creed at work.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet points out to Eizen that she&#39;s staying out of his, Zaveid, and the dragon&#39;s, business. &quot;Do what you have to,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>However, Velvet&#39;s not letting him endanger the crew on his dragon hunt.</p>
<p>Phi dreads the idea of becoming a dragon.</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;If what Eizen says is true then...<strong>could I wind up as a dragon someday? Or Eizen too?</strong>&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;I don&#39;t... <strong>I don&#39;t know.</strong>&quot; <img class=emojione alt=â˜¹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p><strong>Expedition check:</strong> We get a new recipe: a <strong>Mythic Egg and Rice Omelet!</strong></p>
<p>I save here for tonight&#39;s session.</p>

<p>But Rokurou comes in and finishes the praetor off!</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;There, now we&#39;re even, Eleanor.&quot;</p>
<p>Looks like Kurogane&#39;s forge paid off for him!</p>
<p>Magilou loves the &quot;sinister&quot; look of the shortswords...</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;All that&#39;s left is to kill Shigure.&quot;<br>
<strong>Kurogane:</strong> &quot;With me as a witness.&quot; Kurogane&#39;s coming along, too, huh?</p>
<p>Velvet warns Eleanor again about her role as Laphicet&#39;s vessel.</p>
<p>Velvet opens her daemon arm. Eizen tells her to wait. </p>
<p>After a pause, Velvet decides that she&#39;s not that hungry...</p>
<p>Velvet orders Eleanor to fight the exorcists, but not to kill them...</p>
<p>Looks like Velvet knows where Eleanor&#39;s breaking point is at: fellow exorcists.</p>
<p>Velvet labels her virtuous, but Eizen points out that quality&#39;s how she&#39;s able to stay as Laphicet&#39;s vessel. He admires her determination to stay on her mission.</p>
<p>I go back to Kurogane&#39;s Workshop to get the chest there, which has a <strong>Worn Spear!</strong></p>
<p>Now let&#39;s get out of these gloomy mine tunnels!</p>
<p>Hoo boy, I have to take the long way out of these tunnels...</p>
<p>...there&#39;s another sealed door up ahead! I&#39;m guessing there&#39;s probably more candles to light to break this seal...</p>
<p>I light one, now for the rest....</p>
<p><a name=6></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Laphicet asks Rokurou about his Stormhowl about why Shigure called his a &quot;reject.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou explains blacksmiths make a &quot;whooole bunch&quot; of copies, then they deliver their best-quality sword to their client.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;The head of my clan gets the &#39;real&#39; Stormhowl, and his siblings get the remainders.&quot;</p>
<p>So Rokurou&#39;s the youngest sibling, and Shigure the eldest.</p>
<p>Laphicet accidentally offends Rokurou here with the &quot;imitation&quot; Stormhowl. He apologizes.</p>
<p>Rokurou smiles and tells Laphicet not to. He now knows why &quot;he&#39;s so hung up on beating&quot; Shigure. It&#39;s to prove who&#39;s the better Rangetsu...</p>
<p>Magilou now asks Velvet rhetorically about which Laphicet matters to her...</p>
<p>Eleanor stops by and asks what she&#39;s talking about. Laphicet sums it up for her. She&#39;s in shock!</p>
<p>Eleanor tries to deny it. Laphicet then asks Eleanor why Velvet &quot;hates the Shepherd so much&quot; other than the reason he gave her...</p>
<p>Magilou now asks her which truth &quot;is real and which is the imitation?&quot;</p>
<p>I backtrack to break a boulder and open a Katz box, getting a Water Normin Set for Laphicet!</p>
<p>I avoid the monsters here and get into the next tunnel. It&#39;s very huge!</p>
<p>Down the sloped path, I see another sealed door just ahead in the large area!</p>
<p>I traverse around the tunnel, and find a crawlspace...</p>
<p>...after crossing another crawlspace, I find the candle to break the seal on the door!</p>
<p>Now past the unsealed door, and up the path we go...</p>

<p>Laphicet asks Rokurou about his and Shigure&#39;s sword styles.</p>
<p>The Rangetsu school has two forms: a single greatsword for its primary, and notable style, with dual shortswords as the second.</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s also curious about how the second style is used to support the first. Rokurou tells her the dual shortsword style&#39;s meant as a sparring style, or a sparring partner, for learning the greatsword.</p>
<p>Eleanor asks why he holds back. It&#39;s because &quot;Shigure is a true master.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;We trained together since we were small children. I was his sparring partner for ten years.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor looks down.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;His skill with the greatsword is godlike. So...in order to beat him, I took up the shortblades. To our school it might be secondary, but it&#39;s what I know best.&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen points out Rokurou&#39;s short reach.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;If I eliminate my fear I have a chance... I can step inside his guard...he&#39;ll have two times the trouble...&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Eliminating fear, huh? A style for someone who&#39;s lost his humanity.&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> (grins) &quot;Right?&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s like you two are the very swords you carry.&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou tells her tale about Stormhowl and Stormquell...</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;One, an exorcist who walks in the light. One, a daemon moving through the shadows. The only thing these two polar opposites want...&quot;<br>
<strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;...is to cut down the other.&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Precisely!&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor doesn&#39;t see any exorcist or daemon connection to those blades. It&#39;s a matter of whose will survives...</p>
<p>Now let&#39;s get out of here!</p>
<p>In one battle&#39;s end, Magilou has Laphicet read the expression on her guardian card...hee..</p>
<p>There&#39;s the way out! And a save point!</p>
<p>I do some more battles and weapon customization at the Turtlez shop and stop here!</p>

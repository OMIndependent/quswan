<p>Another <strong>skit</strong>: Rokurou&#39;s practicing again (shirtless!) with his sword again. Laphicet points out that he&#39;s having fun with it.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Well, I&#39;m a yaksha.&quot;<br>
<strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;A yaksha... A spirit of war...&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Yeah. A daemon that lives for combat.&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet asks him if he&#39;s afraid of the Swordbreaker, or rather, if he&#39;s afraid of dying. Knowing Rokurou, he wants a fight with this guy.</p>
<p>Rokurou says a variant of the old cliche: &quot;Not afraid to die, but afraid of being alive.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Fighting is my life. It&#39;s all I want to do. So I fight. That&#39;s what living means to me.&quot; He smiles.</p>
<p>A swordsman is an athlete, after all...</p>
<p>Eleanor judges Rokurou harshly, saying under her breath &quot;a daemon is going to be a daemon.&quot; That&#39;s one &quot;loyal&quot; opposing voice...</p>
<p>I speak to the brigand again, who says the ports at the end of the Vesper Tunnels at the east end of the ravine.</p>
<p>He&#39;s got more to say. The brigand decides to reform himself.</p>
<p>Magilou and Laphicet&#39;s interactions post-battle are a bit funny...Magilou&#39;s juggling her guardian cards and Laphicet&#39;s getting sleepy...</p>

<p></p><h2 class=entry-title>Tales of Berseria - Part 48a: Fighting A Flappy Bird Daemon</h2><p></p>

<p>I head down to the south end of the ravine where another code red awaits!</p>
<p>I open a gold chest near where we fought the code red, which has a <strong>Chocolate Idol</strong>, which looks like a chocolate bar for a weapon!</p>
<p>It&#39;s a <strong>Horus</strong>, a more dangerous version of a Scaled Bird, and his Harpy friends!</p>
<p>Eleanor performs her Mystic Arte: <strong>Final Gale</strong> on one of the Harpies, taking care of her!</p>
<p>After finishing his minions, we turn to Horus!</p>
<p>I also get to use Switch Blasts for the first time, switching to Eizen then to Rokurou!</p>
<p>The Horus now unleashes Mantra, literally KO&#39;ing Rokurou, along with Eizen!</p>
<p>The AI switches back to Velvet after I revive Eizen! Then I switch control back to Velvet, going into overdrive! Horus uses his Mantra again!!!</p>
<p>But with help from allies, we finish off the Horus!</p>
<p>We get new rewards such as <strong>Bamboo Paper</strong> (another weapon for Laphicet!) and a new ventite! This ventite shows how many unopened treasure chests there are in the area map!</p>
<p>The game gives me a pointer on the fatigue status...</p>
<p>After the battle, I take control of Eleanor this time...</p>

<p>Making it back from fighting the code red daemon, the minimap indicates there&#39;s three treasure chests here...</p>
<p>I see a nearby save point before a bridge, and save there before pressing on...</p>
<p>Crossing a bridge west of the save point, I see another warp point!</p>
<p>These monsters chasing us really want a fight!</p>
<p>I get a tutorial now, on Eleanor&#39;s Break Soul, or overdrive attack!</p>
<p>While idle or making combos with three souls or more, I can send enemies flying!</p>
<p>Eleanor can cast spells and use martial artes, but she&#39;s not a long range fighter, though.</p>
<p>A daemon with a suit of armor with a dark aura appears before us!</p>
<p>It&#39;s the <strong>Swordbreaker!</strong></p>
<p>Rokurou knows what that sword is: <strong>Stormquell.</strong></p>
<p>Velvet confirms that the enemy is a <strong>Swordbreaker.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Not much for a conversation, are you?&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Silence, they say, is only commendable in an ox tongue dried and a maid not vendible!&quot;</p>
<p>I meant to switch to Velvet, but I end up getting Eizen instead! Aaaagh!</p>
<p>No matter though, since Rokurou does the majority of the fighting at this point!</p>
<p>I switch control to Rokurou, who now has one soul on his gauge!</p>
<p>We take care of the Swordbreaker!</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>...Or not, as he gets up!</p>
<p>Rokurou, all smiles, takes charge. <a href=https://youtu.be/u8YRAAIPCwM>Here&#39;s his theme.</a></p>
<p>He taunts the daemon, and charges at him, and falls!</p>
<p>His daemon eye glows!</p>
<p>The Swordbreaker charges, but Laphicet fires at the Swordbreaker! <strong>Oops!</strong></p>
<p>Rokurou goes after Laphicet! <img class=emojione alt=😟 title=:worried: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/1f61f.png></p>
<p>Eleanor and Velvet jump in!</p>
<p>Rokurou immediately calms down and says that he got &quot;a bit riled up.&quot; Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>Crisis averted. I&#39;m still shaking a bit from that moment when Rokurou was about to attack Laphicet...</p>
<p>The Swordbreaker runs away.</p>
<p>Eizen asks if he knew the Swordbreaker, but Rokurou knows the sword he&#39;s wielding.</p>
<p>Velvet wants to get to the port.</p>
<p>We get another potentite!</p>
<p>Well, that was quite a scare! Laphicet almost died! Naq na nqhygvfg fyhe sebz gur yvcf bs bar bs zl snirf...qnzzvg Ebxhebh!</p>

<hr>
<p>But no time to waste, as I have two Witches pursuing me.</p>
<p>Before crossing the last bridge, Rokurou apologizes to Laphicet. Oh, you&#39;re going to need more than that! </p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s worried about him...</p>
<p>Rokurou tells him that he&#39;ll warn him a bit more clearly when he wants to fight one-on-one. Laphicet asks if he&#39;s sure. Yes, he is.</p>
<p>He really wants to take care of this Shigure person on his own, and beat him in swordfighting.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;No matter how much it costs me...I&#39;ll pay it. Those feelings have been so central to me for so long... I lost my dang humanity somewhere along the way.&quot; I think I remember when we were at Hellawes that he lost his shame too.</p>
<p>Laphicet asks why he has to win against him. I&#39;m always guessing it&#39;s for his &quot;honor,&quot; or rather, as he says, his reason for becoming a daemon. It&#39;s more important to him than his own life...</p>
<p>Rokurou owes Laphicet one for saving him, though. He mentions that he won&#39;t do &quot;a victory pose if [he&#39;s] dead.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s still angry at him...she calls him a daemon. He&#39;s not ashamed to hide the fact that he&#39;s a &quot;big ol&#39; daemon.&quot;</p>

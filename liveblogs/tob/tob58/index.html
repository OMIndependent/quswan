<p>I deliver the sale&#39;tomah to the pirates.</p>
<p>Benwick thanks us! He asks where Eizen is. We tell him that he went after Zaveid.</p>
<p>He tells us why we didn&#39;t go after him?</p>
<p>Since the Abbey&#39;s going after Zaveid, Eizen&#39;s in danger! Benwick knew about Zaveid from the merchants, and that the Abbey&#39;s going to trap him in Lothringen! And Eizen could get caught in the trap!</p>
<p>Eleanor wonders why Legate Melchior&#39;s wanting to catch Zaveid, but she&#39;s thinking of wanting to hand over Laphicet to the Abbey to finish her mission!</p>
<p>Velvet decides to leave Eizen. Benwick&#39;s not okay with that.</p>
<p>In actuality, Velvet wants to rescue him, but she&#39;s being cautious about this. She tells the pirates to stay and drink their medicine while they rescue Eizen and Aifread.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Why else would Eizen barge into a trap, if only to save Aifread?&quot;</p>
<p>Oh, Benwick...he finally gets it!</p>
<p>Velvet gives Eleanor the sale&#39;tomah.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;These pirates don&#39;t have a lick of sense in them.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;They don&#39;t let &#39;reason&#39; dictate who they protect.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> (sighs) &quot;If you say so, daemon.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s waiting for her to eat the flower. She does so. Rokurou smiles.</p>
<p>Lothringen&#39;s a tower meant as a training ground for exorcists.</p>
<p>So <strong>Lothringen</strong>&#39;s our next stop!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Another <strong>skit:</strong> I learn that this is Eleanor&#39;s second sale&#39;tomah drink. The Abbey initiates their exorcists by drinking that stuff at the &quot;welcoming festivities&quot;!</p>
<p>Velvet calls it what it is: hazing. Good job, four for you, Velvet!</p>
<p>Magilou subtly teases Velvet for her loss of taste.</p>
<p>Laphicet tells Eleanor what Magilou meant. Velvet, with a smile on her face, forces Magilou to eat sale&#39;tomah...hee...Laphicet smiles...</p>
<p><strong>Skit:</strong> Eleanor wonders why people fight even though they&#39;ll lose. Bienfu and Eleanor discuss that. </p>
<p>Laphicet mentions Velvet, Rokurou, and Kurogane doing everything &quot;illogical&quot; to beat their targets.</p>
<p>Lots of the words &quot;logical&quot; and &quot;illogical&quot; being thrown around here...</p>
<p>Laphicet calls their determination &quot;amazing.&quot; Magilou butts in again and asks Laphicet why she&#39;s traveling with them. Laphicet doesn&#39;t get what she means by that.</p>
<p>Eleanor laughs.</p>
<p>We meet up with the woman again in the village. She&#39;s heading to Lothringen, and mentions Zaveid, though not by name, who&#39;s meeting &quot;friends&quot; there. She thinks he has exorcist friends...</p>
<p>Looks like Zaveid knew we were coming.</p>
<p>We get directions to get to Lothringen from the woman, who also says the Abbey&#39;s strictly watching the place...</p>
<p>Outside Eleanor tells us where Lothringen is: beyond the Burnack Plateau.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;If you&#39;re gonna set up an obvious trap, couldn&#39;t it at least be someplace more convenient?&quot;</p>
<p>The guards are gone here, and we cross into the tunnel...</p>
<p>Laphicet has a lot on his mind.</p>
<p>Magilou thinks that men care about their toughness, &quot;their street cred,&quot; in a way. Oh, Magilou. Rokurou&#39;s not denying that point. Even Eleanor agrees, noting that everyone has a reputation to keep.</p>
<p>We find a Katz Box in a dead end, and get another fashion accessory!</p>

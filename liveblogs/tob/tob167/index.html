<p>He has a letter for Eizen.</p>
<p>Eizen puts on his glasses and reads, smiling as he does...then he feels a bit strange...</p>
<p>Rokurou asks him what he read.</p>
<p>Eizen has someone else read the letter. It&#39;s probably too emotional for him...</p>
<p>Laphicet reads Eizen&#39;s sister&#39;s letter.</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> </p>
<p>&quot;&#39;Dear brother, I got your letter. Not sure why it was so tattered. I&#39;m glad that you were able to tell me how you really feel, even though it was beyond obvious by now. Your clear descriptions of the self-defense malak artes allowed me to master them quickly, despite your terrible grammar. </p>
<p>&quot;&#39;As weird as it feels writing this to a pirate... good luck with your work. And I know how to keep a secret. So please keep writing me letters. My life doesn&#39;t revolve around them, but I do enjoy hearing from you. I can&#39;t see the oceans you sail from my perch here on the mountain, but I&#39;m thinking of you and praying for your safety. </p>
<p>&quot;&#39;<strong>And I want you to know I&#39;m doing fine.</strong>&#39;&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou sees quickly that Eizen&#39;s sister is &quot;as stubborn as her brother.&quot; She thinks it&#39;s a family trait.</p>
<p>Laphicet reads on.</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;&#39;PS: Thanks for the nor dolls. They&#39;re not really all that cute, but I guess I like them a little bit.&#39;&quot; Heh...</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;&#39;But ever since I got that last one, I hear this voice at night telling me I should write you and be here for you when you need to vent.&#39;&quot;</p>
<p>Everyone&#39;s smiling, then when Laphicet reads that last part of the sentence, the &quot;voice at night&quot; part, they get annoyed quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;&#39;It&#39;s actually rather annoying, but since the doll is a gift from you, I&#39;ll make a special exception for it.&#39;&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen smiles.</p>
<p>Eleanor compliments Eizen&#39;s sister. Velvet&#39;s curious to know the name of Eizen&#39;s sister. Nuns...</p>
<p><strong>Eizen</strong>: &quot;<strong>Edna.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> Rqan vf bar bs gur znynxuvz gung wbvaf gur znva punenpgre va Mrfgvevn, guvf tnzr&#39;f frdhry, jurer gur znynxuvz ner abj pnyyrq frencuvz, sbe fbzr ernfba.</p>
<p>Velvet compliments it as &quot;a pretty name.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Glad you think so. I&#39;m the one who named her.&quot; He smiles saying that last sentence.</p>
<p>So after some weapon and armor tinkering back at the port, we now head off to the final showdown!</p>

<p>Quickest way to get down would be using the icy slopes here...</p>
<p>More battles later, I&#39;m getting new titles for Rokurou!</p>
<p>Rokurou asks Velvet another question: if &quot;the daemons she kills turn back into humans.&quot;</p>
<p>That&#39;s actually some new information there...Rokurou mentions that every daemon he takes care of stays that way...</p>
<p>Rokurou believes it might depend on the case involved for each person. Velvet doesn&#39;t care on the outside, but she&#39;s now wondering about that question in her head...</p>
<p>Maybe it&#39;s because for every daemon Velvet eats, in a way, she&#39;s taking out the daemonblight from them? Like with what she did with the villagers in Aball? And if so, maybe for every daemon she eats she becomes less human?</p>
<p>There&#39;s some builders from the guild near the ship...</p>
<p>The guildmaster tells us the ship&#39;s keel&#39;s wrecked...he decides it&#39;s better that the guild build a new ship for the party.</p>
<p>No ship now. Velvet tells the guild to go home.</p>
<p>Velvet hopes that there&#39;s still time... </p>

<hr>
<p>Now at the Hellawes Sanctuary, there&#39;s Teresa praying to the Empyrean <strong>Innominat.</strong></p>
<p>Oscar walks in to the Sanctuary...</p>
<p>Teresa greets him and is in shock! Oscar&#39;s left eye is bandaged from the fireball Velvet threw at him!</p>
<p>So Oscar came to visit his sister...</p>
<p>Teresa assumes that the daemon that did this to Oscar does not fight fair. Well, Oscar&#39;s malak threw the first blow...</p>
<p>Oscar explains Velvet&#39;s powers to Teresa, and describes Velvet as a &quot;girl with black hair and eyes full of fire.&quot;</p>
<p>Teresa&#39;s eyes widen. She knows who Oscar&#39;s talking about.</p>
<p>Oscar bids her goodbye. Teresa reassures him.</p>
<p><strong>Teresa:</strong> &quot;Worry not. A failure as minor as this is not the end of the world.&quot;</p>
<p>Oscar says that he came to see her just so she could lift his spirits...</p>
<p>Oscar points out Teresa&#39;s earrings. She considers them her treasure...I&#39;m assuming those might&#39;ve been a gift from Oscar. Oscar salutes and leaves.</p>
<p>As Oscar leaves, Magilou is caught!</p>
<p>In Magilou&#39;s perspective, she wasn&#39;t stowing away, just &quot;boarding a ship without permission,&quot; which is basically stowing away...</p>
<p>Teresa now wants answers about Velvet&#39;s whereabouts. Magilou does not cave in, except she does...oh no... </p>

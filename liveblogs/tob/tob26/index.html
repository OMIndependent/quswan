<p>Holy heck! More daemon guards have taken down exorcists!</p>
<p>Rokurou asks jokingly if Eizen&#39;s the daemonblight carrier.</p>
<p>Just the carrier of bad luck, Eizen says.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;This is what it means to walk with the reaper. You&#39;ve only yourselves to blame.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet thinks it&#39;s a plus for the party since the Midgand forces in the Gate are now in disarray...</p>
<p>Velvet asks Eizen how to open the Gate. He points out the controls are on the higher floors of the gate.</p>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/Bd7oajCo12U>Here&#39;s the music for Vortigern. It sounds grand.</a></p>
<p>I check the map. Vortigern spans between Northgand and Westgand.</p>
<p>New monsters: the <strong>Wraiths</strong> here are spellcasters, and the <strong>Wall Men</strong>.</p>
<p>Heading outside, there&#39;s a lone Midgand battleship.</p>
<p><strong>Another skit:</strong> Rokurou&#39;s shocked at the huge span and size of the fortress!</p>
<p>Eizen points out that malakhim were used to build it from the base down...oh my god...</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;If malakhim can be made to fell daemons, they can also be made a hammer to forge metal.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s another way the Abbey and the kingdom show their dominance to the people. It says, &#39;Do not resist. Submit.&#39;&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s disgusting is what it is.&quot;<br>
<strong>Malak child:</strong> &quot;Disgusting.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Agreed.&quot;</p>
<p>This tale has gotten bigger than just a personal vendetta...</p>
<p>My god, the size of this fortress! And to think all of this nearly took three years to build...but at the backs of malakhim.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>They make it to another armory.</p>
<p>Eizen punches out a guard!</p>
<p>He goes to a nearby set of doors, and says it&#39;s bolted and locked. No problem for Velvet, though. Eizen gracefully moves aside.</p>
<p>It doesn&#39;t work.</p>
<p>The guard gets up again! Velvet asks where the key is. The guard&#39;s not telling, saying he&#39;s not falling to &quot;petty daemons.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;<strong>There&#39;s nothing I hate more than someone else trying to control the direction of my life. My wheel is mine to hold.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>He slowly walks over to him.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;<strong>If I&#39;m not the one steering the ship, then I&#39;m not truly alive.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Oh dear, what&#39;s he going to do?</p>
<p>The guard&#39;s not budging. Eizen side punches him and pins him to the wall...oh boy...he tortures him... :(</p>
<p>The guard tells him where the key is easily. Eizen asks where the battleship is. He tells him.</p>
<p>The malak child looks pretty shocked...</p>
<p>Velvet thanks Eizen for that.</p>
<p>So which way first? The control room to open the gate, or the battleship? I&#39;m thinking battleship first.</p>

<p><strong>Another skit:</strong> Rokurou compliments Eizen&#39;s fighting style. He asks if he uses swords. He doesn&#39;t. To him, that&#39;s more bad luck.</p>
<p>Eizen explains that he&#39;s even broken swords by just taking it out of the sheath!</p>
<p>So that&#39;s why he fight with his fists.</p>
<p>Rokurou wishes he could spar with Eizen if he were a swordsman...</p>
<p>They then declare a challenge to each other: sword vs curse. They accept it anytime.</p>
<p>I call up <strong>another skit</strong> between Rokurou and Eizen: about their plan to infiltrate the fortress.</p>
<p>Velvet also comes in.</p>
<p>So the Royal Army has exorcists as commanders, and everyone else as soldiers, huh?</p>
<p>In reality, <strong>that man</strong> is the one in charge. It always goes back to him...</p>
<p>So the Abbey deals with &quot;security and defense&quot; while the Midgand soldiers are commanded by the exorcists...</p>
<p>Rokurou and Eizen are ready to fight! Rokurou with his sword, and Eizen with his fists...</p>
<p>The malak child feels conflicted...</p>
<p>We head for the entrance room where the front gate with the barrier is, and get more items...</p>
<p>Turning back, I now see a save point located across the guard that Eizen KO&#39;d!</p>

<p>The next morn, we get a travel permit and a recipe for the very famous <strong>Mabo Curry</strong>.</p>
<p>Outside the room, there&#39;s now a bunch of people downstairs.</p>
<p>I talk to the head cook, arms crossed. She mentions &quot;Bloodwings&quot; in her complaint about serving customers. Who are the Bloodwings? Is that the name of the shadow guild?</p>
<p>We&#39;re now introduced to another minigame the <em>Tales</em> series is notable for: serving and waiting tables! I pass, knowing how tough that job is irl.</p>
<p><strong>Skit again:</strong> Rokurou compliments the woman in black&#39;s &quot;kind face.&quot; Eizen points out the &quot;fake&quot; documents are actually real. Rokurou knows that this shadow guild is not one to mess with, since even without Baskerville, who Eizen calls a &quot;monument against authority,&quot; they&#39;re still operational.</p>
<p>The official name for the bar, according to a banjo player, is the Bloodwing Butterflies Bar.</p>
<p>The tavern keeper&#39;s devoted to keeping the place open, even pressure from the Abbey&#39;s not stopping him.</p>
<p>The woman in black points out Mendi&#39;s aptitude as a &quot;scholar of geology and chemistry.&quot; He might be useful in trying to sneak us into the villa...that&#39;s probably why they need him. But why ask strangers to take on the job for?</p>
<p>The woman next to her complains about her husband, who talks about his work in the Abbey all the time.</p>
<p><strong>Another skit:</strong> Laphicet asks my question: If they know where Mendi is, why not look for him themselves? Rokurou also asks another: Why resort to a shadow guild to file a &quot;missing persons case&quot;? My guess it&#39;s meant to not raise any suspicions from the Abbey.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Outside at the plaza, one dog owner thinks they should have guard dogs. </p>
<p>One girl asks for a dog and her dad says okay. She promises to walk it everyday...</p>
<p>Guards nearby are talking about weapon upgrades...</p>
<p>A man watching the banjo player play is marveled at the ceremony yesterday...Rokurou says the Prince &quot;is a wimp&quot; if he&#39;s giving that power away to a stranger easily.</p>
<p>The man doesn&#39;t get angry, but tells us the Prince was well-studied, with his hobby falconry, which he doesn&#39;t have time for anymore. He even has two younger brothers who aren&#39;t within his caliber, and who, according to the man, &quot;hang out with a bad crowd.&quot;</p>
<p>Without the Prince, Velvet points out, Midgand&#39;s good as vulnerable.</p>
<p>Plus, the Royal Villa is now HQ for the Abbey. The man admits they needed them after all that&#39;s happened after the Opening ten years ago in-game...</p>
<p>There&#39;s another musician playing across the square...</p>
<p>Near the cathedral grounds, from a granddaughter, we get the names of the Empyreans: <strong>Musiphe of Flame</strong>, <strong>Amenoch of Water</strong>, <strong>Hyanoa of Wind</strong>, <strong>Eumacia of Earth</strong>, and <strong>Innominat</strong>.</p>

<hr>
<p>The high priest, I&#39;m told, has fully backed the Abbey.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> (quipping) &quot;A man of principles.&quot;</p>
<p>The high priest is so principled to the point where he donated to charities and the like. The priest calls the party &quot;dubious&quot; while praising the high priest. Rokurou and Velvet snark rightfully at the condescending label given to them. Hee...their sarcasm&#39;s a breath of air...</p>
<p>Inside the cathedral, one noble youth wants the Abbey to crack down on taverns. Yikes...</p>
<p>Rokurou says that they&#39;ve got the best drinks in town. Wow, this noble guy doesn&#39;t want to be happy, even for a little while. Laphicet adds that &quot;their mabo curry&#39;s delicious.&quot; The noble youth thinks that eating &quot;mabo and curry together is heresy.&quot; Is this the <em>Tales</em> series poking fun at itself?</p>
<p><strong>Youth:</strong> &quot;Abstinence! Austerity! Restraint!&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet brings up a sobering line that sums up as: <strong>Don&#39;t force beliefs onto others.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;People eat to live. Some people live to eat. That&#39;s part of being human.&quot; Dang...</p>
<p>That&#39;s a perfect example of a fundamentalist right there. Not since <strong>Alundra</strong>&#39;s Giles have I seen one that devoted, I think...</p>
<p>No one&#39;s seen Artorius sleep, and he works <strong>thrice</strong> as hard as an ordinary person, He&#39;s never in one place for long either...that&#39;s devotion...</p>
<p>There&#39;s a girl who&#39;s not fond of praying. She&#39;s warned that she&#39;ll catch daemonblight if she doesn&#39;t pray...poor girl... :(</p>
<p>Seeing a group of worshippers before the empty throne, I get a little history about Empyreans here.</p>
<p>Thanks to the daemonblight scare, the people are now going back to praying to the Empyreans again. Then, Velvet brings up a good point.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Maybe Artorius is using religion to manipulate the people into following him...If that&#39;s the case, he&#39;s done a damn fine job of it.&quot;</p>

<hr>
<p>We get more info about the Aldina Plains, which used to be as beautiful as the rest of the region. Then the land shifted...</p>
<p>One little girl mentions how &quot;handsome&quot; the prince and <strong>that man</strong> are. Velvet knows he&#39;s anything but virtuous after what happened in the beginning of the game...</p>
<p>More people to speak to now.</p>
<p>One asks about where daemonblight came from.</p>
<p>From a guard, I find out Galles Lake Road&#39;s a marshland, and leads to the Aldina Plains.</p>
<p>Up near the castle plaza, a guard mentions <strong>that man</strong>&#39;s super busy. Audiences to see him are booked up for a month!</p>
<p>I save here.</p>

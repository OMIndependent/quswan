<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>Tabatha&#39;s behind the bar, saying we did well. The Bloodwings are quick at gathering info...</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in order to get to the temple, the key to lowering the barrier is only in the hands of a high ranking exorcist...maybe a praetor?</p>
<p>Tabatha mentions that a high-ranking exorcist must have four greater malakhim backing them. Under Abbey control only.</p>
<p>Bienfu appears and says he&#39;s a greater malak!</p>
<p>Velvet proposes stealing another one.</p>
<p>Magilou talks like Yhxr (name ciphered) now, &quot;what a pain...&quot; Hee. Velvet tells her to stay if she doesn&#39;t want to come.</p>
<p>Magilou&#39;s not happy about not being addressed by a formality.</p>
<p>Velvet now asks if she would join her &quot;to attack the Shepherd.&quot; Bienfu&#39;s in shock!</p>
<p>Magilou finds Velvet&#39;s mission entertaining.</p>
<p>Laphicet now politely asks Magilou, nervous, if she and Bienfu could join them.</p>
<p>Magilou decides to stay.</p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s coming. Same with Eizen, since Melchior&#39;s also at the temple...</p>
<p>Velvet hands over the insignia back to Tabatha. She insists she keep it.</p>
<p>Velvet thinks Tabatha will regret helping people who are trying to take care of &quot;the savior.&quot; Tabatha laughs.</p>
<p>Eizen tells Velvet to wait. Laphicet&#39;s sleeping. Long night indeed.</p>
<p>Another night in the tavern...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Laphicet wakes.</p>
<p>He apologizes to Velvet.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Don&#39;t worry. Getting sleepy or hungry is [natural]. I won&#39;t eat you.&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet asks her about her injuries. Velvet says she&#39;s fine.</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;You&#39;re really tough, aren&#39;t you, Velvet?&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;You have to be tough if what you seek is revenge.&quot;</p>
<p>I wish she&#39;d tell him everything that&#39;s happened to her.</p>
<p>Some Bloodwings are at the tavern are sleeping their heart out because they posed as soldiers during our mission...</p>
<p><strong>Tabatha:</strong> &quot;See you later. If you&#39;re still alive.&quot;</p>
<p>Next day, Magilou&#39;s overjoyed that she gets to &quot;play&quot; with her malak Bienfu again...Velvet tells her not to kill Bienfu. Magilou then tells her not to eat Laphicet.</p>
<p>Magilou points out we&#39;re facing not just the Shepherd, but an Empyrean. Oh boy...</p>
<p>Velvet thinks <strong>that man</strong>&#39;s lying, and says a true god can cure daemonblight.</p>
<p>Eizen smirks.</p>
<p>Velvet believes that &quot;there&#39;s something people call Innominat&quot; whom she calls &quot;a malak that summoned other malakhim to come into the world.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;You sound confident.&quot; It&#39;s because she saw it right before her eyes. But in between those three years, <strong>that man</strong> might have done tons of things to curry that so-called god&#39;s favor.</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;Revenge against Artorius...for her brother...&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou asks where the Empyrean&#39;s Throne is. It&#39;s in the northern road.</p>
<p>Eizen sends a message by sylphjay to his crew to recon the area.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I get into a <strong>skit</strong> pointing out the usefulness of sylphjays.</p>
<p>Rokurou jokes about eating a grilled one with a hard drink. Oh my god... *smh*</p>
<p>Eizen&#39;s not happy about what he said, saying sylphjays are <strong>serious business</strong> for pirates.</p>
<p>Sylphjays can also identify people via their &quot;wavelengths.&quot; They&#39;re a kind of bird from the north.</p>
<p>Eizen tells another story about how they had sylphjays aboard the crew, and how Benwick took care of them.</p>
<p>Rokurou wants a taste of one of them. Laphicet stops him! He&#39;s joking again, but his smug smirk says otherwise...</p>
<p><strong>New skit:</strong> Bienfu introduces himself to us, as a greater malak.</p>
<p>Eizen and Laphicet are considered greater malak. Eizen tells Laphicet not to let a label like that bother him. Bienfu, though, is reliant on that label...</p>
<p>Magilou starts teasing Bienfu again, calling him &quot;her greatest servant.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;And our roster of the oblivious grows longer.&quot;</p>
<p>I stop here.</p>

<p><strong>Expedition check:</strong> We get some cologne, or an Eau de Seduction...</p>
<p>We head back to the inn. What did they find?</p>
<p><strong>Grimoirh:</strong> &quot;Well, as it turns out [Laphicet] has quite the knack for languages.&quot;<br>
<strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;Only because I&#39;ve got the best teacher.&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet reads the song they translated:</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Eight-headed is the Lord of the Land<br>
With seven months to devour malevolence<br>
Through pulses of earth doth base nature&#39;s flow<br>
As He awaits the time of awakening.</strong></p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Four Empyreans may tear him asunder<br>
But so long as there is one receptive to divine power<br>
Therions shall be forever reborn<br>
In sight of the full crimson moon.</strong></p>
<p>&quot;<strong>The Nameless Empyrean hath one heart.<br> 
The Nameless Empyrean hath one body.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Wait a minute. I&#39;m guessing Velvet&#39;s brother and the Shepherd might have known something about this.</p>
<p>Grim explains that the book we found has songs &quot;pertaining to Innominat.&quot; Lucky find, indeed!</p>
<p>Velvet wants to rush this quickly. Same here.</p>
<p>But Grim and Laphicet have only translated the bare lyrics so far...</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s thoughts are a bit suspicious...</p>
<p>She approaches the book, and analyzes the drawing for us.</p>
<p>Eleanor mentions the seven heads in the picture as...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/h8tr1JR.png alt=picture width=608 height=342></p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>Therions.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Eleanor doesn&#39;t know what the book means when it&#39;s referring to &quot;malevolence.&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen asks about the second stanza of the song.</p>
<p>Eleanor brings up her broad knowledge of Empyrean history, that four Empyreans, elementals, created the world. But Innominat&#39;s one. Hmmm...</p>
<p>She guesses &quot;a war broke out between Innominat and the other Empyreans that resulted in him being sealed away.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;But if there is someone to connect with this &#39;divine power,&#39; the therions will keep spawning, and [...] Innominat will be revived. If we assume [the Shepherd] fits that bill and that he&#39;s trying to reawaken Innominat, everything lines up.&quot;</p>
<p>So now our next mission is to go after the therions. Rokurou asks the same question as me: <strong>Where are they?</strong></p>
<p>Eizen reminds everyone that Innominat&#39;s head and body &quot;are connected through earthpulses.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;If their job is to feed Innominat, the most effective place [...] would be at the earthpulse points.&quot;</p>
<p>This means the Abbey&#39;s using the temples to feed Innominat.</p>
<p>With the Empyrean&#39;s Throne at the center, Yvolg Ruins being one of those places, and Palamedes another...</p>
<p>Laphicet mentions the sigil that sealed the beetle we found in Warg Forest.</p>
<p>So the beetle&#39;s a therion...like Velvet.</p>
<p>The griffin in the villa&#39;s also a therion!</p>
<p>Velvet asks if therions &quot;come in different forms.&quot; I suppose so.</p>
<p>Rokurou asks if they could double-check the villa back in Loegres. Nope. Velvet thinks we need more info from the book.</p>
<p>Grim&#39;s puzzled by another line in the song: &quot;<strong>Therions being &#39;forever reborn.&#39;</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We cut to a sea of stars and a small fading light with small raindrops...</p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s eyes widen! He sensed Innominat&#39;s power again!</p>
<p>His compass points to the direction of where Palamedes Temple is! This must mean (and I&#39;m guessing here) that the compass is pointing to where the therions, or a therion, is being held!</p>
<p>Eleanor notices that temples are built based on strong spiritual energy and that the Abbey&#39;s taken them over. She asks if Palamedes is on an earthpulse point. I&#39;m guessing yes.</p>
<p>Eizen notes there&#39;s plenty of earthpulse points around the world.</p>
<p>But now it&#39;s off to Palamedes first.</p>
<p>Grim stops us, theorizing what would happen if we took care of a therion...but she lets that thought pass. Oh, Grimoirh. </p>
<p>I&#39;m going to guess that since Velvet is also a therion, she&#39;s probably going to die... <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Someone got an Exorcist Card pack with a Rank 1 Bienfu and isn&#39;t too happy! It&#39;s probably a common card...</p>

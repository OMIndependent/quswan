<p>After reading the guide, I realize I could pass through those Red Fumes easily, by finding a Fruit from a tree in that forest...</p>
<p>I pick a Red Fruit from the tree and have my character eat it.</p>
<p>After picking up an Arcane Bottle, we pass through the Red Fumes easily!</p>
<p>Making a bit further, we see Blue Fumes ahead of the monsters here in the east. I check for a Blue Fruit tree nearby and eat the Fruit.</p>
<p>In the next area now, not many monsters around...but there&#39;s Yellow Fumes blocking our next area forward.</p>
<p>I head to the west part of the forest, and jump on the steps up to the cliff to pass through the huge boulder barricade.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a large area, with <strong>Hornet</strong>s surrounding the landscape...</p>
<p>There&#39;s a tree bearing Yellow Fruit at the southwest part of this area.</p>
<p>Going to the northwest tip, past Red Fumes is where the code red for this forest is...</p>
<p>I jump back to the start of the area, and jump up and run west to a Red Fruit tree...</p>
<p>Since the code red area&#39;s blocked off by a river, and we haven&#39;t activated the geotree for this place yet, I advance through the Red Fumes in the southwest area and pick up any leftover Katz spirits, and open up the nearby Katz Box, winning us a <strong>Right Earring!</strong></p>
<p>Eating the Yellow Fruit now...</p>
<p>...and passing through the Fumes here...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Now to the east area we go!</p>
<p>Turning a corner, up ahead, we see the geotree for this forest!</p>
<p>Now to face the code red here...</p>
<p>I realize that I forgot to eat the Red Fruit here, and I geoboard around the area, before going back to the barricade, and jumping up to where the tree is...</p>
<p>The code red daemon here is a <strong>Dryad</strong>, who looks a lot like Kamoana in her daemon form!</p>
<p>This daemon&#39;s a bit strong since she can cast Freeze Lancer! She&#39;s got a wide number of artes she can cast!</p>
<p>After a semi-tough battle, we win a <strong>Hero&#39;s Ventite</strong>, which increases the potency of our healing artes for anyone below a certain amount of health!</p>
<p>Now to move forward...</p>
<p>Almost every path forward in the area where we found the geotree is blocked by Fumes...so which fruit to eat to cross through?</p>
<p>After opening the chest nearby, I take the Red Fruit.</p>
<p>Not much to scavenge for here, but I take the treasures, go near where we found the geotree, and eat a Blue Fruit.</p>
<p>We&#39;re now at the last area in the forest...</p>
<p>Now what to find here?</p>
<p>I jump up from the east side of the cliff to get to the other side of the boulder barricade...</p>
<p>I eat a Red Fruit here and cross over into an area with plenty of Katz spirits for the taking!</p>
<p>The way to the last part of this area is blocked by Yellow Fumes...</p>
<p>After turning back and eating the Yellow Fruit here, I go on ahead, past the fumes, and take everything in the area, including a <strong>Purity Charm</strong> for Rokurou!</p>
<p>There&#39;s supposed to be an event here, but I think I might have missed something...</p>

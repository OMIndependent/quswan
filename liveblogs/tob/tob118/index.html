<p>After an expedition, Velvet&#39;s now more softer-sounding and encouraging. She wishes the crew &quot;good luck.&quot; Character development, yay!</p>
<p>Down the steps we go...</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s smiling. Aaaaah! What is this sorcery!? </p>
<p>Magilou tells Velvet to open her mouth. She&#39;s checking her teeth to &quot;see if she&#39;s broken anything.&quot; If her teeth were broken, Velvet would lose the bet she made with Magilou.</p>
<p>Magilou pulls in Phi for the inspection.</p>
<p>Velvet asks why Magilou&#39;s dragging Phi into this.</p>
<p>Magilou, you troll...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Why are you making this even more awkward?&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;We can&#39;t settle the bet until we know the tooth!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Fine, but let&#39;s check the ones with my left hand first.&quot;</p>
<p>Now Magilou drags Bienfu for the unnecessary dentist appointment. Poor Bienfu...</p>
<p>Eleanor giggles.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Looks like Velvet&#39;s just fine.&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Yeah. The spark&#39;s returned to her eyes.&quot; That same spark that she lost three years ago...</p>
<p>Rokurou asks if &quot;showing the inside of one&#39;s mouth is embarrassing.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor blushes.</p>
<p>More steps to climb.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Eleanor wonders what the Abbey&#39;s plans are for the Calix.</p>
<p><strong>Zaveid:</strong> &quot;...they&#39;re trying to keep it hidden. Can&#39;t be anything good.&quot;</p>
<p>Another auto <strong>skit:</strong> Zaveid asks Phi about his &quot;friend,&quot; the other malak.</p>
<p>Poor Phi. They were still numbers, enslaved to Teresa back then...</p>
<p>Phi&#39;s sad.</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;I found Velvet and the others, but he probably had nowhere to go.&quot; <img class=emojione alt=â˜¹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Zaveid, quit with your lady hunting!</p>
<p>Phi doesn&#39;t get what he means.</p>
<p>Zaveid decides to look after Phi&#39;s friend until he gets his free will.</p>
<p>The battle music&#39;s changed as well...</p>
<p>This is a big place...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>After Velvet cooks quiche, I activate a <strong>skit</strong> where Eleanor and Rokurou talk.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Wait, do you just not like quiches?&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor says that she likes them. She just hates spinach.</p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s smug smile when he realizes Eleanor doesn&#39;t like spinach reminds me of SpongeBob&#39;s &quot;You like Krabby Patties&quot; face.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> (sighs) &quot;I suppose there&#39;s no point in denying it.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;I know a lot of people don&#39;t like carrots or bell peppers. But spinach...that&#39;s a new one to me.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou also brings up her distaste of sale&#39;tomah.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s actually because of the sale&#39;tomah. I used to love spinach when I was little, but now it just reminds me of... euch, sale&#39;tomah...&quot;</p>
<p>For Magilou, she now likes spinach post-sale&#39;tomah...</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Being a fussy eater is just another way of life. You&#39;re in charge of your own plate.&quot; </p>
<p>This man is going to get his glory because he defies fate and his misfortune so much...</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s projecting that everyone hates spinach like her.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;I&#39;m talking about the Spinach Method! Supporting Peers In Achieving Cohesive Harmony! It&#39;s the foundation of any successful team, and you all...fail at it!&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou doesn&#39;t get what she means.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Some of us just aren&#39;t cut out for team leadership.&quot;</p>
<p>Then Eizen points out that the Spinach Method is a <strong>big</strong> requirement to get into Aifread&#39;s crew.</p>
<p>Eleanor asks about his report...oopsie, Eizen seems to have forgot about that...</p>
<p>Now Eleanor forces Eizen, Rokurou, and Magilou to sit as she lectures them...all of this because she hates spinach...</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;How did we get from spinach to a lecture on team-building?&quot; Yeah, how did we?</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Moving on, I get the first <strong>Elixir</strong> for this game!</p>
<p>Eventually, I activate another <strong>skit:</strong> Zaveid asks Phi to name the malak child.</p>
<p>Even Zaveid thinks calling someone by a number &quot;seems mean.&quot; At least Zaveid isn&#39;t that cruel...</p>
<p>Rokurou takes over calling him &quot;Hajime&quot; or &quot;the first.&quot;</p>
<p>Zaveid suggets Ichirou, or &quot;first son.&quot; Rokurou&#39;s not going for that, he mentions that name &quot;was Shigure&#39;s childhood name.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor suggets Ichi and Numby.</p>
<p>Velvet asks where the second name came from.</p>
<p>Phi suggests not to mention his number at all.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;How about Bob?&quot; Maybe <a href=http://pokemon.wikia.com/wiki/Ash_Ketchum>Ash</a>, or <a href=http://studio-ghibli.wikia.com/wiki/Haku>Haku</a>?</p>
<p>Magilou thinks she got that name because of his hair. I got Haku because of that too.</p>
<p>Eleanor prefers Bobby.</p>
<p>Phi tells the party &quot;a boy doesn&#39;t want a name that sounds cute!&quot;</p>
<p>Zaveid thinks his name needs more &quot;panache.&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen suggests <strong>Silva</strong>, noting his pendant and hair color.</p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s happy with that name, mentioning its &quot;mystique.&quot; Phi likes it too!</p>
<p><strong>Zaveid:</strong> &quot;Well done, first mate.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Praise from you is wasted on me.&quot;</p>
<p>Zaveid calls out to Silva. Yay! The malak has a name now!</p>
<p>Awww, Phi&#39;s laughter and smile is so radiant...</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Another <strong>skit:</strong> Rokurou asks Magilou what she was doing while everyone was stuck in the earthpulse.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;I was ringing the bell. The rift was open the whole time. Couldn&#39;t you hear me?&quot; Evatvat gur oryy...nabgure <em>Irfcrevn</em> ersrerapr? Gurer arrqf gb or zber <em>Irfcrevn</em> ersreraprf...</p>
<p>Eleanor &quot;didn&#39;t hear any bells.&quot;</p>
<p>Bienfu explains what she actually did: she held Melchior back. Bienfu, through tears, calls her last stand &quot;moving.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Yes, yes. I did endure. It was so hard not to laugh.&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Did the old man tell you a joke or something?&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou mentions it as being &quot;a staring contest.&quot; Rian Johnson extreme close-ups and all, I&#39;m guessing...</p>
<p>She tried to imagine him younger, but with the same face...</p>
<p>What &quot;ringing of the bell&quot; is Magilou talking about?</p>
<p>Magilou asks Phi if &quot;he&#39;s fishing for sympathy&quot; when Phi asked what broke.</p>
<p>Magilou hates being awarded and praised. Velvet knows Magilou don&#39;t care about the honors.</p>
<p>A golden pillar&#39;s down at the bottom isle. That&#39;s probably the warp!</p>
<p>Now we&#39;re at the second Calix...</p>
<p>An arte barrier made up of multiple rings of chains await us...</p>
<p>Phi sees it first. There&#39;s a dragon locked up in the barrier!</p>
<p>Eleanor wonders why the Abbey would do this.</p>
<p>Magilou deduces that since the Calix is near Innominat&#39;s earthpulse, Phi wonders if Innominat&#39;s involved with the dragon.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/KGO8xIn.png alt="idgi explain" width=480 height=270 id=hd-liveblog></p>
<p>Oh, Zaveid...</p>
<p><a name=6></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Velvet starts to explain. Phi&#39;s worried.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> (smiles) &quot;I&#39;m fine now. I promise.&quot; Aaaaahhh!<br>
<strong>Phi:</strong> (smiles too) &quot;All right.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet explains everything to Zaveid.</p>
<p>Zaveid asks if she&#39;s going to fight Innominat. Yes, she is.</p>
<p>Zaveid compliments her as &quot;ice cold.&quot; Oh my god, Zaveid.</p>
<p>Rokurou wonders about what will happen to Innominat if &quot;humans can&#39;t create any more malevolence.&quot;</p>
<p>Innominat needs malevolence to survive, or maybe he needs it to be at full power instead of actually using it as sustenance.</p>
<p>Eleanor thinks he might sleep again.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;But if he [sleeps], then his power will fade and humanity will start creating malevolence again, right?&quot; It&#39;s a deadly cycle.</p>
<p>Velvet explains that he does need malevolence to sustain himself. Hence why these dragons.</p>
<p>Eizen calls the Calix a &quot;dragon farm&quot;. It does look like a field.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;You can&#39;t be serious!&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou thinks it&#39;s plausible.</p>
<p><strong>Zaveid:</strong> &quot;They can&#39;t think of malakhim as anything but tools...&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Just how much will they sacrifice for their ideal world of tranquility...?&quot;</p>
<p>Another <strong>skit:</strong> Eleanor&#39;s having a moral crisis regarding her beliefs about the Abbey. All because of the dragons they have.</p>
<p>Phi wonders if the malak used to be human then turned into a dragon...Eizen confirms it. And Melchior must have turned the malak into one.</p>
<p>Even laidback Zaveid isn&#39;t too happy...</p>
<p>Bienfu tries to cheer up Eleanor.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;But spawning dragons in addition to therions...you think they&#39;ll figure out a way to make humans [turn into dragons] too?&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Yes. Wait, that&#39;s awful!&quot;</p>
<p>They probably will...just like how they did with the Shepherd.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;We don&#39;t dare free it. It&#39;d be too dangerous.&quot;<br>
<strong>Zaveid:</strong> &quot;I know. Damn the Abbey and their twisted morality.&quot;</p>
<p>My god, that scene was deep...</p>
<p><a name=7></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Off to exploring the rest of this colossal floating archipelago!</p>
<p>Crossing a bridge, Phi and Velvet talk about their family relations. Phi now knows his father&#39;s the Shepherd.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Look, you were reborn, right? Honestly, I really don&#39;t know anything about how being reborn works. But to me... what you see [...] hear and [...] feel? That&#39;s what&#39;s important. Whoever we used to be in another life, I&#39;m me now, and you&#39;re you. That&#39;s all there is to it. <img class=emojione alt=ðŸ™‚ title=:slight_smile: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/1f642.png>&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou points out what Eizen said about malakhim being reincarnations of humans. Eleanor speculates that malakhim might be reborn from other living things like birds or fish...</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s not-not-not-not-not true!&quot;</p>
<p>She uses a dog as an example. Then she goes on to call Phi &quot;Velvet&#39;s little pup.&quot; Oh my god, Magilou.</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;Be careful. I bite.&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Have mercy! I take it all back! Just don&#39;t bite me!&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen explains malakhim&#39;s rebirth.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Everyone&#39;s lives are founded on the past.&quot; I never thought of life that way...</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;So I&#39;m just me.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Yep. You&#39;re you and no one else. You&#39;re Phi.&quot; Aaaahhh...Velvet&#39;s smiling so warmly...</p>
<p><a name=8></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Let&#39;s hope this one&#39;s the last <strong>skit</strong>...</p>
<p>Zaveid asks Eizen about the daemon bodyguard of Melchior&#39;s...</p>
<p>Eizen says he doesn&#39;t know.</p>
<p>Zaveid feels that that&#39;s probably Aifread...</p>
<p>Eizen says again he doesn&#39;t know. I think he&#39;s trying to deny it...</p>
<p>Velvet mentions they haven&#39;t fought him so far. They met him in Aball...</p>
<p>Velvet thinks Melchior&#39;s &quot;controlling him&quot; through his illusion powers.</p>
<p>Zaveid tells her that would&#39;ve been a hard fight if they did face him...</p>
<p>Zaveid has very good insight.</p>
<p>Eizen still can&#39;t believe that might be him. But he mentions his scar...</p>
<p>Down more staircases, and there&#39;s the last pillar of light...</p>
<p>We&#39;re now at <strong>Hexen Isle</strong> proper, <strong>An Island Wiped From Existence</strong>.</p>
<p>Zaveid tells us he sailed here. He tells us the ship&#39;s docked southeast.</p>
<p>So we&#39;re in the island southeast of Islegand in the map...</p>
<p>There&#39;s lots of big, tall monoliths here.</p>
<p>I save at this point.</p>
<p><a name=9></a></p>
<hr>
<p>And there&#39;s our old friend, the White Turtlez!</p>
<p>The new monsters on Hexen Isle are <strong>Enticing Glamor</strong>s...</p>
<p>We take the herbs around the monoliths and head further...</p>
<p>...but a rift opens! Oh no!</p>
<p>A purple ball of energy bursts from the rift!</p>
<p><strong>No, Silva!!!</strong></p>
<p>Eizen&#39;s the first to see him down!</p>
<p><strong>Innominat:</strong> &quot;We used to play tag all the time. I won&#39;t let you get away, Velvet.&quot;</p>
<p>Fearful, Silva&#39;s falling under the malevolence, no!!! <strong>Why!?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Innominat:</strong> &quot;[Turning Silva into a dragon] is the whole reason I took him from Teresa. It&#39;s just another necessary sacrifice for peace.&quot; I cannot believe I&#39;m typing this down...</p>
<p>Silva turns into a dragon! <strong>No....why!?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;<strong>Innominat, you monster!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Innominat to the front of us, a dragon to the back of us...Reaper&#39;s Curse doesn&#39;t begin to describe it.&quot;</p>
<p>Innominat&#39;s hungry for some despair...</p>
<p><a name=10></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Innominat:</strong> &quot;Is that despair I sense?&quot;<br>
<strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;Not on your life.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;It&#39;ll take more than this to make your big sister break.&quot;</p>
<p>Then Innominat pulls a line that wouldn&#39;t be too out of place in a Borg episode. His tone sells it.</p>
<p>Zaveid decides to face him, using Siegfried as his powerup! <strong>Three times!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Zaveid:</strong> &quot;[My power] knows no limits! For I am Zaveid!&quot;</p>
<p>Zaveid makes a hurricane to blow Innominat away and continues his fight...</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;This is officially too damn much!&quot; You think so?</p>
<p>We face the <strong>Hellkite Dragon!</strong></p>
<p>He&#39;s weak against non-elemental and water attacks, but strong against fire and earth...</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;If only I&#39;d been a larger vessel...&quot;</p>
<p>We start the barrage, as the Hellkite unleashes his fiery breath!</p>
<p>I have to be careful when he unleashes his Seize attack!</p>
<p>He does a Neigh, which stuns us!</p>
<p>Then, after a few minutes later, he&#39;s healing himself! Magilou tells him to stop it!</p>
<p><a name=11></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Oh my god, Innominat finished Zaveid off!</p>
<p>Innominat crosses his arms, unhappy.</p>
<p>Phi decides to take on Innominat by himself! Oh god!</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s not letting him fight one-on-one with him!</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;This isn&#39;t an order. It&#39;s strategy.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet quietly gives him her blessing to face him.</p>
<p><strong>Innominat:</strong> &quot;For something that&#39;s a mere part of me, you&#39;re really uppity.&quot; Look in the mirror, O Mighty Empyrean.</p>
<p>Phi casts his artes...</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;<strong>I am the malak Laphicet. I am my own master!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Innominat&#39;s now going at him with full power...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;And neither will we!&quot;</p>
<p><a name=12></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Now we face the Hellkite sans Laphicet.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;But nothing&#39;s changed.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Everything&#39;s changed. Phi&#39;s trying to become someone new.&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s a gamble! I&#39;m in!&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Me too.&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;You stay out of this! Your [...] coin always land on skull!&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Then someone will have to flip it for me.&quot;</p>
<p>I unleash my allies&#39; Mystic Artes on the Hellkite!</p>
<p>Oh, come on! He&#39;s healing now!!?</p>
<p>Now he&#39;s unleashing his fire artes like Calamity Flare!</p>
<p>Now the dragon&#39;s healing!? Ai ya...</p>
<p>Velvet states it isn&#39;t!</p>
<p>Laphicet vs. Innominat is still playing out..,</p>
<p>Innominat casts his fireball at Laphicet!</p>
<p>Innominat&#39;s smiling face as he tells him to surrender is creepy...</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;No way I&#39;m apologizing! Not to some jerk who doesn&#39;t understand how Velvet feels!&quot;<br>
<strong>Innominat:</strong> &quot;...she&#39;s <strong>my</strong> sister.&quot;<br>
<strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;I know eveything. But I won&#39;t tell you!&quot;</p>
<p>Innominat fires, and charges at him Dios Rush-style!</p>
<p>Phi pulls out the compass!</p>
<p>Innominat pauses!</p>

<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>The next morning, Eleanor says she&#39;s fine, and Laphicet warns Eleanor not to pull that stunt again.</p>
<p>Velvet threatens to eat her if she starts running...eee...</p>
<p>Eleanor swore her oath before their duel that she would stay as Laphicet&#39;s vessel. Right...</p>
<p>Velvet asks her about the Abbey&#39;s plans next with Innominat. Her answer: To stop daemons and end the Era of Disaster.</p>
<p>Eizen tests her.</p>
<p>So Eleanor lies (I think?), saying that only higher-ups have knowledge of what the Abbey does with Innominat.</p>
<p>Our next stop is to find Grimoirh, but our first step is to find a village.</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;Even the greatest scholars don&#39;t know everything at first. You can&#39;t get answers without asking for them.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet assigns Eleanor the task of protecting Laphicet no matter what. The same task that the Shepherd gave her.</p>
<p>Velvet warns Laphicet about Eleanor just in case she does anything funny...</p>
<p>Laphicet says she&#39;s nice and honorable. Velvet knows the same things that I do about the exorcist.</p>
<p>Magilou mentions oaths as complicated magic...</p>
<p>Velvet warns Laphicet again to be careful. Magilou agrees, using Velvet as an example.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor&#39;s now in our party!</strong></p>
<p>She&#39;s also earned additional titles too!</p>
<p>Another <strong>skit</strong>, where Eizen almost sounds like Barbossa when he warns Laphicet.</p>
<p>Eleanor objects to the crew&#39;s perceptions of her, saying she hates manipulations and &quot;duplicity.&quot; Eizen gives her his blessing to not have Laphicet end up like him and Rokurou.</p>
<p>I have our newest member take the lead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> I&#39;ll admit that I got spoiled on the fact that Eleanor will join the party weeks ago. I didn&#39;t get spoiled on how she was going to join, thank goodness.</p>
<p>Checking the menu and Eleanor&#39;s stats now, along with the area map. Even the world map&quot;s not opening since we don&#39;t know where we are.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Expedition check:</strong> we get a Portrait of the Three Guardians, and a <strong>Swordsman&#39;s Eyepatch</strong>!</p>
<p>Eizen looks at the material of the stained glass used in the window.</p>
<p>This guy is an art connoisseur, I swear. He refuses to sell this treasure!</p>
<p>Velvet still doesn&#39;t understand why Eizen would want to keep the window.</p>
<p>But the creatures in the window look familiar, one of them I know from another <em>Tales</em> game...</p>
<p>Engaging into a battle with another flying monster now: the <strong>Scaled Bird!</strong></p>
<p>Newer enemies like the <strong>Witch</strong> and <strong>Harpy</strong> are here too!</p>
<p>The battle music&#39;s also changed!</p>
<p>Laphicet unleashes his Mystic Arte!</p>
<p>I get pointers on weaknesses and resistances afterwards...</p>
<p>I read the synopsis at the part where Velvet and crew are at the Empyrean&#39;s Throne. The Shepherd mentioned the ritual where he killed Velvet&#39;s brother needed &quot;two sacrifices!&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen pretends not to know that Eleanor&#39;s a mole spying on the crew.</p>
<p>Laphicet notices a rock, which might be brightsteel. Rokurou knows it too. By the material, Eizen thinks they&#39;re in &quot;Endgand or Islegand.&quot; He mentions there&#39;s not that much Abbey troops around those parts.</p>
<p>Velvet praises Laphicet and tells him to wash his hands.</p>
<p>Another <strong>skit</strong>, where it&#39;s a continuation of the one at the entrance of the ruin.</p>
<p>A third <strong>skit</strong>, where I&#39;m told brightsteel&#39;s hard to mine...</p>
<p>The prospector has to do plenty of work and tons of gambling to get brightsteel.</p>
<p>Laphicet mentions a pendulum, which Magilou mentions dowsing. Velvet thinks dowsing&#39;s a scam.</p>
<p>Rokurou now gets to the topic of Zaveid on his use of a pendulum as a weapon. Easier to fight with, Eizen says.</p>
<p>Eizen mentions the four elements and malakhim.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> (thinking) &quot;I never realized malakhim could be so calculating.&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen adds that Zaveid&#39;s serious when he fights. That&#39;s how much he loves fighting.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Another battle with three <strong>Treants!</strong></p>
<p>Across a bridge and down the hill we meet our first local, a <strong>Brigid Brigand.</strong></p>
<p>He gets frightened and mentions a <strong>Swordbreaker!</strong> Who&#39;s that?</p>
<p>He draws his weapon, and we fight!</p>
<p>We beat him and Rokurou readies his daggers and charges at him! He breaks the brigand&#39;s sword!</p>
<p>The brigand goes to his knees, begging...</p>
<p>Laphicet brings up Eleanor.</p>
<p>Eleanor asks him where the nearest settlement is.</p>
<p>He tells us we&#39;re in &quot;<strong>Cadnix Island in Islegand</strong>,&quot; and that the &quot;port&#39;s on the other side of the ravine.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou asks about the Swordbreaker.</p>
<p>The Swordbreaker&#39;s a daemon who fights other swordspeople and breaks their blades, just like Rokurou.</p>
<p>He even took care of exorcist praetors too!</p>
<p>More info about him: he wields &quot;a foreign sword.&quot; The brigand warns Rokurou about Stormhowl, and that the Swordbreaker&#39;s on the prowl for people like him.</p>
<p>Eleanor tells the brigand to give up his criminal ways...</p>
<p>We get another new glacite as a reward!</p>
<p><strong>Skit:</strong> We see Laphicet with the ancient book...he can&#39;t read it. Neither can Eleanor. Velvet calls it &quot;a lucky find.&quot; </p>
<p>And it all goes downhill from here when Bienfu steps into the picture...</p>
<p>I quick save here.</p>

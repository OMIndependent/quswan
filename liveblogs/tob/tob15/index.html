<p>There&#39;s someone running, and attacking a daemon with her spear! It&#39;s an exorcist!</p>
<p>But the daemon wasn&#39;t Dyle.</p>
<p>She&#39;s crying...because the Abbey&#39;s refused to help this village since they don&#39;t want to follow their rules.</p>
<p>But she&#39;s trying to make excuses for herself in front of Velvet. She&#39;s a praetor.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor Hume</strong> is her name.</p>
<p>The look on Velvet&#39;s face is classic &quot;idgaf.&quot; She asks about Dyle.</p>
<p>Eleanor wanders off to find Dyle and &quot;put it to the sword.&quot; She doesn&#39;t even see the daemon as a person, of course.</p>
<p>A girl asks if the praetor&#39;s gone. She&#39;s relieved that she&#39;ll get eaten. She then starts denying that she&#39;s hiding a daemon.</p>
<p>Rokurou reassures her that he won&#39;t tell anyone. He sort of reminds me of both Lhev and Nyiva here... (names ciphered)</p>
<p>She points out the lizard daemon Dyle is in the northern cave. She gives them fruits to keep them quiet.</p>
<p>Velvet and Rokurou eat them. It tastes good for Rokurou.</p>
<p>But Velvet looks sad. She can&#39;t taste the fruit anymore... <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Rokurou has a serious look on his face.</p>
<p>The game tells us we&#39;re now in <strong>Beardsley, the Snow-Covered Hamlet.</strong></p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Velvet wonders why there are exorcists patrolling the outlying areas.</p>
<p>Rokurou points out they&#39;re there to &quot;measure the success of whether exorcists win or not.&quot; He also says it&#39;s to put a check on other exorcists, to ensure they&#39;re doing their jobs. He likens these exorcists to MPs.</p>
<p>Now how does he know that? I&#39;m getting suspicious of how much Abbey lore he knows...</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Still, it&#39;s best not to take a woman&#39;s tears at face value.&quot; Rokurou, you teaser...</p>
<p>So the villagers here are discriminated against by the Abbey.</p>
<p>Lol, Rokurou&#39;s cuddling with yaks...then the yak burps at him! <img class=emojione alt=😂 title=:joy: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/1f602.png></p>
<p>The villager nearby warns him not to smell their burps, as they ruminate their food.</p>
<p>So Beardsley&#39;s the sulfur supplier, while Hellawes sells flamestone. But business and trade remain stagnant in Beardsley...</p>
<p>One villager hates the Abbey&#39;s strict rules to the point where he stole medicine from Hellawes for his child...</p>
<p>We find another Katz chest and free the Katz from the box. No reward.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The Abbey even crushes local businesses too...</p>
<p>Most of the villagers have given up trying to cover for Dyle.</p>
<p>Eleanor usually checks up on Beardsley&#39;s citizens by &quot;asking them &#39;serious questions.&#39;&quot; One warns that she might get in trouble if she starts getting too curious...</p>
<p>So if one breaks a rule, or doesn&#39;t follow the Abbey to the letter in Hellawes, one ends up in Beardsley. Oh my god...</p>
<p>The Elder explains more about what happened after the Advent, saying that the exorcists came to &quot;quell the tide of daemons and to restore the human world.&quot; But they could only protect the &quot;important&quot; cities.</p>
<p><strong>Elder:</strong> &quot;There aren&#39;t enough exorcists to protect everyone.&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;When the going gets tough, cut off any excess baggage. It&#39;s the &#39;rational&#39; thing to do.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s probably why Artorius turned on Velvet...it was the &quot;rational&quot; choice for him...</p>
<p>Elder makes his case for humanity. They&#39;re not robots or cattle, he says. He and the other villagers chose to defy the Abbey for the sake of their freedom.</p>
<p>Exorcists aren&#39;t perfect...</p>
<p>Now one question&#39;s on my mind for this week:<br>
<strong>Is Rokurou a spy? He seems to know certain things about the Abbey, and about ships...or maybe he&#39;s that good at observations?</strong></p>

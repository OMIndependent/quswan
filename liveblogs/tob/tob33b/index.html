<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> I realized last night after my session that the Bloodwings in this game are another name for the &quot;Dark Wings&quot; in other <em>Tales</em> games...</p>
<p>I check the surrounding area maps for our next mission. Turns out the ambushers are in the same area the code red daemon is at on the highway...</p>
<p>The holy bottle&#39;s still in effect...</p>
<p>Making it to the area, it seems that we were too late to stop the ambush...</p>
<p>There&#39;s three people about to clean up the caravan...Velvet and the crew approach them...</p>
<p>...And the three ambushers are actually Gibbon daemons disguised as humans! The red crates are food to them!</p>
<p>We finish them off!</p>
<p>Rokurou smiles one of his pretty smiles after realizing that the ambushers were daemons...</p>
<p>The doctors ran away.</p>
<p>Eizen opens the crates, seeing that the daemons wanted Cathedral-approved medicine.</p>
<p>Laphicet finds something: it&#39;s a red scarf! The daemons disguised as humans wore that scarf...</p>
<p>Velvet thinks they&#39;re just daemons attacking more innocents...</p>

<hr>
<p>Back in town, I play <strong>another skit:</strong> It looks like most of the citizens are onto Velvet&#39;s crew, with Rokurou hearing them mention their exploits in Hellawes and the Gate.</p>
<p>Eizen points out everyone&#39;s still calm for now.</p>
<p>Velvet sulkily notes they&#39;ll be even more famous once <strong>that man</strong> is finished.</p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s lighting up at the idea, calling it &quot;fun.&quot; Laphicet doesn&#39;t get his reasoning.</p>
<p>Rokurou mentions wanted posters and bounties on the crew&#39;s heads. He wants to see himself in a wanted poster.</p>
<p>I wonder how they&#39;re going to draw the crew. Badly drawn wanted posters are another <em>Tales</em> series staple. Rokurou, for some reason, is aware of this.</p>
<p>Eizen&#39;s seen wanted posters that &quot;make [him] a monster,&quot; or &quot;a handsome youth.&quot; He finds it &quot;fascinating.&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet hopes he gets to see himself in a wanted poster.</p>
<p>Rokurou devilishly smiles, telling Laphicet to &quot;really stir things up.&quot; Laphicet promises &quot;to stir [them] up good.&quot; Lol...</p>

What a badass smile!</p>
<p>Now that was a short job!</p>

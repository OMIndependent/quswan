<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>I would have called this place the Nofbecgvba Tngr...</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s the cave! I can feel a powerful earthpulse flowing inside it!&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;It looks like we can reach the core from there.&quot;</p>
<p>I see a gold chest west of here, which has a <strong>Gloire des Mousseux Sash</strong>...</p>
<p>Into the volcano we go!</p>
<p>It&#39;s frozen solid inside...</p>
<p><strong>Skit:</strong> Magilou asks about Velvet&#39;s plan to escape the volcano in any case if it ever erupts...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;There is no plan.&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou overacts in crisis.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;I&#39;m not going to die.&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Well, I&#39;m super happy for you! But what about the rest of us!?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> (smiles) &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll all make it.&quot;</p>
<p>Phi also thinks there&#39;s no eruption after we&#39;re done here since we&#39;re only pushing in souls into the volcano, which will not cause it to erupt...</p>
<p>Eizen however, mentions &quot;a great shift in the earth&quot; once the Empyreans wake up, and to be cautious.</p>
<p>Laphicet is very sure everyone will be okay.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Hahaha! You&#39;re starting to sound like Velvet!&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;You look sure of yourself, but I&#39;m still nervous.&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou thinks of writing a last will and testament before they proceed. Eizen&#39;s not letting her use his pen and paper.</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s still confident about their chance of success.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> (to Magilou) &quot;Besides, it&#39;s not like you have anyone to give a will to.&quot; <strong>Ohhhhhh! Owch!</strong> </p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We face off against more monsters: a <strong>Blood Heat</strong> (a fire bat), a <strong>Hundrepede</strong>, and a <strong>Freezillo</strong>!</p>
<p>Now the steep climb to the cauldron of the volcano begins...</p>
<p>The icy crystals here make the place so cold...</p>
<p>Oh my goodness, it&#39;s a long way, huh?</p>
<p>Magilou&#39;s shivering and almost falling asleep...</p>
<p>As we ascend the volcano&#39;s chilly caverns, we see more natural crystalwork...</p>
<p>The Hundrepedes are also nasty poisoners!</p>
<p>So much traveling to get through in this volcano cave!</p>
<p>Before the last part of the second area, Laphicet asks Rokurou about Shigure...</p>
<p>Rokurou has a question for Laphicet. He&#39;s serious.</p>
<p>Rokurou asks Phi about his time in the hot spring bath in Meirchio. Oh my god...this guy! I thought he had something serious to ask Phi.</p>
<p>Laphicet blushes.</p>
<p>Then Eizen steps in. Oh boy...</p>
<p>Poor Laphicet...</p>
<p>Rokurou calls this &quot;resolve&quot; question of Eizen&#39;s &quot;like a test.&quot;</p>
<p>Phi went into the bath alone.</p>
<p>These two guys...oh my goodness. *smh*</p>
<p>Phi says that he &quot;[doesn&#39;t] want Velvet treating him like a little kid.&quot; Understandable.</p>
<p>Rokurou laughs and congratulates him. Eizen tells Phi that he passed.</p>
<p>Rokurou and Eizen are amazed at Laphicet&#39;s character development in such a short time. In real time, it&#39;s been three months...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;If you&#39;re just going to pick on me, <strong>go away!</strong>&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> (laughs) &quot;We&#39;re sorry, really. But I really needed that. Laughter&#39;s good for the soul.&quot; No wonder why he sounded serious. He&#39;s nervous with his duel against Shigure...</p>
<p>Phi asks if he actually is nervous.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;You wouldn&#39;t think it, huh? <strong>But now I can fight like I always do. I owe ya, Laphicet.</strong>&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> (to Rokurou) &quot;<strong>Looks like the next test is yours.</strong>&quot; Yep...</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Laphicet, Eizen, <strong>watch me prove myself.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Let&#39;s hope this battle is one-on-one like last time. If it does, this checks the <em>Tales</em> game trope of a one-on-one duel before the final battle...</p>
<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> I wrote this without realizing that this game already had its one-on-one duel, way back at the ravine in Islegand.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Rokurou, how do you think Shigure will move against us?&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;He&#39;s not really the imaginative type. He&#39;ll be out in the open, waiting for us.&quot;</p>
<p>More slopes to climb...</p>
<p>Now we&#39;re outside again.</p>
<p>Eleanor points out this is a good place to get ambushed or surrounded by enemies...</p>
<p>Rokurou knows Shigure&#39;s more of the traditionalist battler. He won&#39;t pull anything like a surprise attack, and after Rokurou says that, I get caught into a surprise attack by <strong>Winter Wolves!</strong></p>
<p>There&#39;s a lot of monsters bunched up on this ascent...</p>
<p>I see a save point at the entrance to the hot cave of the volcano, and stop here.</p>

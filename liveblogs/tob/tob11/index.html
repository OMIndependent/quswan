<p>Now the ship&#39;s landed in cold climes...</p>
<p>A young boy comes to a sleeping Velvet and heals her...she wakes and sees Laphicet, or a malak. He runs.</p>
<p>But daemons stop him!</p>
<p>Velvet runs to protect him!</p>
<p>Magilou calls Velvet a &quot;box of horrors,&quot; as Velvet consumes more daemons.</p>
<p>Rokurou apologizes for not coming to her aid, saying he&#39;s unarmed. Velvet points out he&#39;s wearing a weapon: Stormhowl. Rokurou will not use it, though.</p>
<p>The malak fled...</p>
<p>Velvet tells both Magilou and Rokurou to leave. No way, says Rokurou, as his debt to her isn&#39;t paid yet. Plus, there&#39;s no nearby towns...</p>
<p>Rokurou picks up a map, probably dropped by the child malak.</p>
<p>We&#39;re in <strong>Northgand</strong>...</p>
<p>But, in order to get to <strong>Midgand</strong>, they need to fix the ship.</p>
<p>Magilou&#39;s asking where the nearest warmest place is...along with food and tales.</p>
<p>We&#39;re now in <strong>Figahl Icecaps, the Land of Dancing White</strong>, and our next stop is to go to <strong>Hellawes</strong>.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Magilou asks Velvet about the child, who she called &quot;Laphicet.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s also curious as to why he can heal without orders from their exorcist or master. Maybe he&#39;s a free malak.</p>
<p>He took the compass too...</p>
<p>We also stole the map from him.</p>
<p>Lol, Magilou, you are far from being &quot;an island of virtue in a sea of wickedness.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou agrees with her, probably sarcastically.</p>
<p>Magilou and Rokurou have another skit chat. Rokurou&#39;s curious about the difference between a witch and a spellcaster...</p>
<p>She says it&#39;s a matter of nuance. Oh my god, she&#39;s very funny, but very audacious.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Self-improvement in all things, I suppose.&quot;</p>
<p>I read the synopsis so far. The Sorcerer&#39;s Ring has a name: <strong>Brunhilt.</strong></p>
<p>I save before proceeding further.</p>
<p>I also look up the fashion menu, and I can switch between animations. It&#39;s a nice detail. It&#39;s one of the reasons why I like the <em>Tales</em> series so much.</p>
<p>I can also access the world map by going to the area map first and pressing triangle.</p>
<p>Enough stops, let&#39;s go.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Magilou complains about Velvet&#39;s wardrobe in the freezing weather. Velvet&#39;s not human anymore, as Velvet herself points out.</p>
<p>This place reminds me of <strong>Xillia</strong>&#39;s wide-open areas, but more colder.</p>
<p>I get some <strong>Rosemary</strong> planted near the edge of the icy cliff.</p>
<p>Another skit: Rokurou got locked up in Titania because of personal, family-related problems. Magilou asks if he&#39;s sure that he should be carrying more debts. Rokurou recites one of his family&#39;s maxims: &quot;Pay what you owe.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou was locked up for three years, like Velvet too. Same with Magilou.</p>
<p>So Magilou got locked up for &quot;unlicensed witchcraft.&quot; Lol...she says it&#39;s &quot;a tale of betrayal most wicked and foul.&quot; Just like Velvet. Velvet reacts a bit.</p>
<p>Flying monsters, just like in <strong>Secret of Mana</strong>, are pretty hard to hit.</p>
<p>I see a lone <a href=http://aselia.wikia.com/wiki/Katz>Katz</a> and three spiky chests...</p>
<p>I turn around and climb the incline to get more treasure.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a lone chest on a small crevice, but there&#39;s no bridge nor any ability I have yet to cross over there.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I do some more level grinding before moving on to the next area.</p>
<p>We see a tall stone wall before us, that&#39;s probably the city of <strong>Hellawes.</strong></p>
<p>Holy heck, there&#39;s exorcist guards surrounding the entrance to the city!</p>
<p>Now, how are the threesome going to get in?</p>
<p>The malak appears before them again, and apologizes for taking the compass. He places it on the ground and runs off...</p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s suspicious of him, since he might be working for the exorcists.</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s considering him for dessert, if necessary. Yikes...</p>
<p>We follow the child malak through a small passage on the side of the city into a small opening.</p>
<p>I save here before climbing the ladder up to Hellawes.</p>

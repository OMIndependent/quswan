<p>The credits roll...</p>
<p>Oh my god, there&#39;s Velvet and Innominat together in an embrace, devouring themselves...</p>
<p>And I get flashbacks (?) of Velvet and Laphi&#39;s adventures. Arthur and Celica greet them goodbye as they go sailing to other lands...</p>
<p>Velvet jumps at a spider!</p>
<p>Magilou and Bienfu save Velvet and Laphi from a daemon!</p>
<p>What could have been...</p>
<p>Laphi and Velvet eat their apples...</p>
<p>Laphi and Velvet with Eizen and Aifread looking on...</p>
<p>Laphi&#39;s eating his Mabo Curry with Rokurou and Shigure at a table behind them.</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s worried, looking at Velvet and Laphi tired from all the steps they had to climb. Oscar and Teresa are in the background, finished with their ascent.</p>
<p>Velvet and Laphi lost, pointing in opposite directions...</p>
<p>They&#39;re now at Southgand, Velvet looking at the Grim dolls while Laphi sees Grim walking.</p>
<p>Laphi picks up the rhinostagros!</p>
<p>The references in the credits mentions all the mothership and escort titles in the <em>Tales</em> series.</p>
<p>Laphi and Velvet run to Meirchio...</p>
<p>They see the northern lights...</p>
<p>Aaaaaahhhh, oh my god, it&#39;s baby Phi!</p>
<p>They&#39;re out prickleboar hunting with Arthur looking on...</p>
<p>Niko and Velvet are prepping up a pie.</p>
<p>The last sketch is of Phi, or Maotelus, seeing Laphi and Velvet staring at the horizon.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<p>Post-credits scene time!</p>
<p>A convoy is traveling through a foggy road.</p>
<p>There&#39;s still daemons afoot...</p>
<p>And there&#39;s Rokurou!</p>
<p><strong>Maotelus:</strong> &quot;<strong>This is not... the end of chaos. It is the beginning.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou pulls his second longsword out, smirking. His literal &quot;come at me&quot; face.</p>
<p><strong>Maotelus:</strong> &quot;<strong>Mankind... will go on fighting without end...</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou makes short work of them!</p>
<p><strong>Maotelus:</strong> &quot;<strong>...just as they did.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen sits at the mast head of the ship. He flips his coin. Benwick turns around...he&#39;s gone...humans can&#39;t see malakhim anymore...</p>
<p>The coin still turns up a death&#39;s head.</p>
<p><strong>Maotelus:</strong> &quot;<strong>People will still seek the horizon...just as they did.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>More rebuilding...</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s overseeing everything.</p>
<p><strong>Maotelus:</strong> &quot;<strong>For every laugh, there will be tears.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s caught between a fight between two men. She breaks them up.</p>
<p>Kamoana! She gives Eleanor an apple!</p>
<p>Medissa and Dyle are there too. As is Tabatha.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<p><strong>Maotelus:</strong> &quot;<strong>But the hate they may embrace will be matched by love.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor walks to her.</p>
<p>Magilou&#39;s looking on in the shadows, Bienfu in tow. She&#39;s writing something down.</p>
<p><strong>Maotelus:</strong> &quot;<strong>This world is cruel and unforgiving.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Bienfu&#39;s sleeping. Magilou kicks him awake.</p>
<p><strong>Maotelus:</strong> &quot;<strong>...even the gods themselves don&#39;t know what the future will bring.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou stops at a small flower. She goes down to take it but stops herself. She walks away.</p>
<p>Bienfu trips and falls. Oh, Magilou...</p>
<p><strong>Maotelus:</strong> &quot;<strong>Nevertheless... I will always believe in them, Velvet...in humanity, both strong and weak...</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s smiling.</p>
<p><strong>Maotelus:</strong> &quot;<strong>In humanity, both fearsome and kind...the day will finally come when your dream becomes reality. Until then...I will kindle a flame within me, burning strong and bright!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Maotelus raises his hand!</p>
<p><strong>Maotelus:</strong> &quot;<strong>And...</strong> <strong><em>I will live!</em></strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Another bright of flash of light...</p>
<p><strong>Fin.</strong></p>
<p>Next (if I ever get around to it), I&#39;m taking on the post-game stuff...</p>
<p>I save at this point. My god, that was a decent ending.</p>
<p>Honestly, if helping people is a &quot;selfish request,&quot; then I&#39;ll take it!</p>
<p>Thinking about it now, Shepherd Artorius himself was technically the last therion to awaken Innominat...</p>
<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> Coincidentally, I just finished this game (the main story) on the day of its Japanese release!</p>

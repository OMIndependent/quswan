<p>Innominat stabs the compass!</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;She isn&#39;t...<strong><em>yours!!</em></strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Oh my god, <strong><em>did he just punch an Empyrean!?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;<strong>Velvet is Velvet!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Innominat:</strong> &quot;And you&#39;re just a fragment of me!&quot;</p>
<p>Phi warns the party of Innominat&#39;s attack!</p>
<p>Innominat fires a beam of light, which hits the Hellkite! </p>
<p>Uh oh...</p>
<p>The Hellkite breathes his flames at Innominat!</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> (to Phi) &quot;So that was your strategy.&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou&#39;s not happy about that surprise attack!</p>
<p>Innominat gets up and uses his power to turn Laphicet into a dragon! <strong>No!!!</strong></p>
<p>But...<strong>it didn&#39;t work!</strong> Green flames surround Phi!</p>
<p>Innominat&#39;s now screaming...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>The malevolence burned away?</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Phi faints. Eizen catches him.</p>
<p>Now the crew takes off! Rokurou&#39;s carrying Zaveid...</p>
<p>And we get our rewards...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Innominat sees the ship sail away...</p>
<p>The Shepherd comes, so does Melchior and his bodyguard.</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;They got away.&quot;<br>
<strong>Innominat:</strong> &quot;<strong>A silver flame</strong>...A strange arte that malak used.&quot;<br>
<strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;Did you forget that you have <strong>the power to digest malevolence?</strong>&quot; Whoops...since Phi&#39;s a part of Innominat, even a god like him did not see that coming...</p>
<p>The Shepherd still sees malakhim as objects, labeling Phi as an &quot;it&quot;...he does not even see him as the reincarnation of his unborn son... <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>The Shepherd judges Velvet for how far she&#39;s gone, yet he never bothers to look at how far gone he is too...or maybe he knows...</p>
<p>Innominat blames the Hellkite for his mistake.</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;So long as you learn from your mistake, such a ruse won&#39;t work a second time.&quot; One of his maxims, I&#39;m guessing.</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;After all, malakhim are mere servants of the Empyreans. As long as we stay wary, they pose no threat to our ideal world.&quot;</p>
<p>Melchior brings good news for Innominat, bad news for us. So only the four Empyreans can only stand a chance against Innominat now...</p>
<p>Now Innominat&#39;s next plan is to take care of them too.</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;Not now. We need to make preparations for the Ceremony of Suppression.&quot; Probably that&#39;s going to take place on another Scarlet Night. From the flashbacks, Laphi mentions the next Scarlet Night being three years away...now that it&#39;s three years later, it&#39;s coming...</p>
<p>Melchior assigns his daemon bodyguard to pursue the crew.</p>
<p><strong>Melchior:</strong> &quot;Even after he succumbed to daemonhood, he withstood my illusions for [a week]. Even now, he resists...However, he used to be known as the most fearsome pirate in all the seas. His strength is equal to that of a legate&#39;s.&quot; I knew it!</p>
<p>Melchior orders Aifread to take Velvet alive.</p>
<p>But the Shepherd and Innominat order Laphicet&#39;s death &quot;before [Velvet]&#39;s eyes.&quot; Oh god...</p>
<p>Aifread&#39;s still trying to break free...</p>
<p>Innominat floats up to his level. Oh my god...<strong>what is he doing to him?</strong></p>
<p>The Shepherd walks away.</p>

<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>I&#39;m feeling like something bad&#39;s about to happen here...I just know it.</p>
<p>We make it, and at the corner of the cape, we see princessias blooming under a tree.</p>
<p>Laphi and Velvet sit down by the princessias.</p>
<p>Velvet mentions this place never changes. Laphi knows that if only one factor changes: the wind, the sea, or the seasons, so does the whole place.</p>
<p>Laphi knows that those changes also apply &quot;across the sea.&quot; Velvet doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s talking about.</p>
<p>Laphi thanks her for taking him out to the cape.</p>
<p>Velvet asks Laphi the same question Arthur asked her: &quot;Do you know why it is that birds fly?&quot; Is that question some sort of code?</p>
<p>Laphi answers that a bird flies so it can easily find food or get away from predators.</p>
<p>Laphi notices something...uh oh, it&#39;s a daemon!</p>
<p>Velvet tells him to be brave and run!</p>
<p>Hoo boy, our first match with a daemon! And it&#39;s weak against hidden artes!</p>
<p>But we can&#39;t do any damage to the daemon!</p>
<p>Velvet now lunges at the daemon with her blade...oh my god!</p>
<p>Laphi now baits the daemon to him! Oh my god!</p>
<p>Laphi, almost unconscious, gives Velvet a comb...so that&#39;s what Laphi bought from the merchant!</p>
<p>She crawls to him, and oh god, the daemon&#39;s coming!</p>
<p>The daemon&#39;s about to strike, with Velvet shielding Laphi...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>...But Arthur finishes it off!</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s knocked out now, and is back in the cabin...</p>
<p>Laphi apologizes, and hands her the comb...he compliments her hair, and tells her to take care of it. Laphi hugs Velvet.</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;<strong>I&#39;ll make a new world. A world where my sister can be happy.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Now the <strong>Scarlet Night</strong> comes...Velvet wakes up in shock!</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Was it all a dream?&quot; She sees the comb.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;No, it wasn&#39;t!&quot; She runs out of bed...oh no, the daemon&#39;s on the roof of the cabin!</p>
<p>And he has reinforcements! Oh no...</p>
<p>Velvet runs out of the cabin and tries to find Laphicet.</p>
<p>This feels like a horror movie. It&#39;s pretty unusual for a <strong>Tales</strong> game.</p>
<p>Oh my god, all of the villagers are dead...</p>
<p>Oh my god...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The gate to Morgana Woods is surrounded by daemons!</p>
<p>I have Velvet head to the Tranquil Woods gate after saving!</p>
<p>But I get caught into a battle with more daemons!</p>
<p>A tutorial tells me I can escape by running to the blue line and keep running until a gauge fills up...</p>
<p>I make it, and go to the Tranquil Woods...</p>
<p>But there&#39;s more of them!</p>
<p>I have Velvet keep running, making it to the save point before the cape&#39;s incline!</p>
<p>There&#39;s Laphicet and Arthur in front of the shrine ruins!</p>
<p><strong>Arthur:</strong> &quot;<strong>One more sentiment to cast off.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><strong>I knew it!</strong> Knowing these games, there&#39;s going to be a betrayal somewhere!</p>
<p>Laphicet tells Velvet to run!</p>
<p>Seres uses her fire magic on Velvet, pinning her down...</p>
<p><strong>Arthur:</strong> &quot;Here once was the seal to the underworld broken. And tonight, here shall be born the power to save the world. <strong>With Laphicet&#39;s life as a sacrifice.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><strong><em>What!?</em></strong></p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Arthur lodges the sword on the shrine ruins...and Laphicet is trapped in a golden bubble, unconscious...</p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s now being cast off as a sacrifice...Arthur stabs his sword into the arte diamond.</p>
<p>Oh my god! So that&#39;s similar to the image who was pinned in the sky that I saw at the start of the game!</p>
<p>I&#39;m guessing Arthur may have done this to Celica seven years ago...oh my god...</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s in shock!</p>
<p>Laphicet falls...</p>
<p>She jumps down and grabs Laphicet!</p>
<p><strong>Arthur:</strong> &quot;Ever a slave to emotion.&quot; Oh my good lord...</p>
<p>With cold eyes, he sees Velvet and Laphicet sink down into the abyss below. A fanged mouth opens and golden dragons take Laphicet...</p>
<p>The dragons come out of the abyss and kick out Velvet, who now has a left arm that I saw from the beginning of the game.</p>
<p>This really sounds <strong>Count of Monte Cristo</strong>-like, except there are no jealous &quot;friends,&quot; only a knight templar willing to sacrifice even his loved ones...</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Here we go...</p>
<p>The daemons now come, and she takes care of them, and absorbs them with her arm. Arthur, cold as ice, notices, and calls her a therion.</p>
<p>She now mauls the daemons with her new arm in anger...</p>
<p>So the daemons were the villagers. Oh my god...Niko&#39;s gone too...</p>
<p>Arthur mentions that the daemonblight has spread in Aball...oh god...</p>
<p><strong>Artorius Collbrande</strong>, you templar.</p>
<p>Velvet lunges at him, but is stopped by Seres, who we can now see.</p>
<p>The comb&#39;s now in Seres&#39;s hands too.</p>
<p>And new beings are summoned.</p>
<p><strong>Artorius:</strong> &quot;<strong>Why is it that birds fly?</strong>&quot; So that sounds like a coded question...</p>
<p><strong>Artorius:</strong> &quot;<strong>I ask no forgiveness. The sin is mine to bear.</strong>&quot; He stabs her.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong><em>Artorius!!!</em></strong>&quot;</p>
<p>There&#39;s so many questions I have about what just happened, but one that stands out is:<br>
<strong>Was Laphicet aware that he was going to be a sacrifice?</strong></p>

<p>The fused Shepherd is weak against fire and wind, but strong against earth and water...</p>
<p>Wish me luck!</p>
<p>Eizen&#39;s taken aback by the Shepherd having that malevolence of despair.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Was he holding it in check this whole time?&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> (somber) &quot;One misstep, and he would have become a daemon...&quot;</p>
<p>It makes sense, though. After Celica&#39;s passing, there was nothing left for him anymore. So, in his mind, the world&#39;s gone...</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Such is the power of [the Shepherd&#39;s] determination.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;But also proof of his true nature!&quot;<br>
<strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;We can&#39;t lose to him now...we&#39;ll never lose to despair!&quot;</p>
<p>This final boss is a tank!!!</p>
<p>Now after tons of pressure, the fused Shepherd unleashes his Mystic Arte: <strong>Right of Rule!</strong></p>
<p>Lucky Velvet&#39;s completely immune to most of the damage the Shepherd&#39;s dishing out!</p>
<p>Now a quarter of his health&#39;s remaining, and in one arte he used, I blocked all of the damage!</p>
<p>As Eleanor gets KO&#39;d, fitting enough, Velvet strikes the final blow!</p>
<p>The Shepherd praises her growth.</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;<strong>Let us settle this here and now, Lord of Calamity.</strong>&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<p>This is making me tense up a bit...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>Shepherrrrrrrrrd!!!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>They fight!</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>I will devour all this hatred!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Her sword breaks!</p>
<p>Oh god...</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s about to punch him!</p>
<p>The Shepherd is beginning to lose his nerve.</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;<strong>Stop struggling!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet unleashes her arm...</p>
<p>The Shepherd holds it back with his sword!</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;Give up...! I will end the world&#39;s sadness! <strong>I HAVE to end it!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet headbutts him!</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>Arthur&#39;s forgotten maxim!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Then she bites his neck! Oh my god!</p>
<p>She pulls out Innominat from the fusion!</p>
<p>She disarms the Shepherd with a spin kick!</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>Don&#39;t despair...</strong> <strong><em>NO MATTER WHAT!!!</em></strong>&quot;</p>
<p>She did it...</p>
<hr>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;<strong>Spoken...like a true hero...</strong>&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>It&#39;s what you told me once, long ago.</strong>&quot;<br>
<strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;<strong>On the day... of the Opening...</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>I forgot he said that. It&#39;s been eight months...</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;Velvet...<strong>the Arthur you knew died that day. It was always there, in the back of my mind. &#39;If only Celica and my son hadn&#39;t died that day.&#39;</strong>&quot; He&#39;s feeling guilty of what happened to Celica and Laphicet.</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;<strong>&#39;If only it had been you two [Velvet and Laphi] instead.&#39;</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>There&#39;s the charm he made for Celica, hanging on his own sword.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;I thought the same thing. So many times. If it had been us, then <strong>I know...I know you would have fought to save the world for us.</strong>&quot;<br>
<strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;<strong>It&#39;s true...I wanted to save everyone...</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Tears fall from Velvet...</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;<strong>...Such a pity.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>He falls.</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;<strong>Goodbye.</strong>&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;<strong>It&#39;s over.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Innominat&#39;s at the corner, starving...</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;No, it&#39;s not over yet...&quot;</p>
<p>There&#39;s another final boss!!!! And he is very hungry...</p>
<p>Oh god, Innominat&#39;s getting creepy...his power is unleashed!</p>
<hr>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;His power is running wild!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;No one is keeping his power in check anymore! This is bad...&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen runs to Innominat!</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>Wait! I&#39;ll do it.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Innominat:</strong> &quot;I endured it all...! Even though I was scared! Even though it hurt!&quot;</p>
<p>She hugs him.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>I know.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>He, or Laphi, cries, talking about his medicine, and not eating for the whole day...</p>
<p><strong>Laphi/Innominat:</strong> &quot;I tried so hard... <strong>Why won&#39;t you give me this!?</strong> <strong><em>I hate you! I hate you, Velvet!</em></strong>&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>Laphicet... you tried really hard. But you don&#39;t have to fight anymore.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>He starts to devour her.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>It&#39;s time for us to rest, Laphi.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>She pulls out her arm and eats him...</p>
<p><strong>Innominat:</strong> &quot;Vel...vet...&quot;</p>
<p>They&#39;re devouring each other...</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;So that&#39;s it... <strong>Velvet will let Innominat devour her forever, with her forever devouring him in return. She will seal him while keeping him alive. An infinite contradiction, a perpetual cycle of destruction.</strong>&quot;<br>
<strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;Velvet, you can&#39;t!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;You and I are part of Innominat, Phi. If he dies, both of us will die too. I dug my own grave. But...but you...&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet runs to her.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;I don&#39;t care about myself! I&#39;m not scared of dying, as long as I&#39;m with you!&quot;</p>
<p>She tosses him the fortune apple.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Good. Then die.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;m laughing a bit since that exchange <a href=https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/then-perish>reminded me of a certain meme</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;But only after eating. Living. Doing everything you want to in life.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet chuckles a bit.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>I really am horrible, aren&#39;t I?</strong>&quot; At least you&#39;re honest about yourself, Velvet.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>But despite all that, you still saved me. With your unwavering kindness and strength.</strong>&quot;<br>
<strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;I didn&#39;t do anything... Velvet, you were the one whoâ€”&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>You must have seen it during our travels. Humans spend their lives in constant struggle... that&#39;s why they end up making so many mistakes. Even my poor brother.</strong>&quot; She looks at the Shepherd when she said that.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>That&#39;s why I&#39;m asking this of you...Please, live.</strong> I was the cause of so much chaos and destruction...<strong>help the world I ruined. Help people like me. Help the weak.</strong> <strong><em>This is... my last, selfish request.</em></strong>&quot;</p>
<p>That&#39;s the opposite of selfishness, that &quot;selfish&quot; wish is. Laphicet cries foul.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>I&#39;m truly... sorry...</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet eats the apple, and forgives her!</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;Velvet, <strong><em>I love you!</em></strong>&quot; Oh my god...<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Thank you...I...I love you too, Phi...&quot;</p>
<p>They&#39;re gone...</p>

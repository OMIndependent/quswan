<p>I load my game from the previous save point, just after our pre-final battle moments.</p>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/beC6GUzySQw>The music playing here gives me the chills.</a> Extra points in that the music is Velvet&#39;s theme.</p>
<p>I talk to the pirate who mentions the Class 4 Zone again, along with Grim, and listen in on Kamoana and Medissa&#39;s conversation again.</p>
<p>I edit the previous notes I wrote for these scenes.</p>
<p>I suddenly realize Grim might be hinting that Melchior could be a candidate for the therion of despair, or could it be Magilou?</p>
<p>I also go through the wellspring of feels between Kamoana and Medissa again...</p>
<p>I get the <strong>Mythril Daggers</strong> from the gold chest for Rokurou...</p>
<p>...and we&#39;re off!</p>
<p>I check out the Sanctuary. It&#39;s empty.</p>
<p>Now to the gates, where Laphicet wishes he could &quot;seal Innominat&quot; with his power. Rokurou comes by.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Just don&#39;t be too eager to help, okay? You&#39;ve got a bad habit of trying to play the good guy.&quot;<br>
<strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;Oh no, I&#39;m not a good guy...<strong>I&#39;m a selfish, wicked little boy!</strong>&quot; Lol...<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Oho, is that so?&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;But if you acknowledge your selfishness, then it&#39;s something you&#39;ve chosen for yourself, right? Now all that&#39;s left is to follow your own creed. Only that.&quot;</p>
<p>Why isn&#39;t Eizen getting some glory for holding his own wheel?</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Besides, I&#39;m a daemon. Even if you were the worst of the worst, I&#39;d be like, &#39;Cool.&#39;&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;Thanks Eizen. Thanks Rokurou.&quot;</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Now the three girls talk...</p>
<p>Eleanor tells Velvet not to &quot;give up on Laphicet..&quot;</p>
<p>Looks like Eleanor&#39;s not as saintly as she claims to be, as Velvet knows she heard her and Laphicet&#39;s conversation.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Heavens! I never knew a praetor to be so utterly shameless!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>No matter how selfish you are, life&#39;s empty without anyone to share it with...</strong>more than anything, I don&#39;t want to give up. Not on myself.&quot;</p>
<p>Out the door we go, and we&#39;re now outside! Look at those geysers!</p>
<p>There&#39;s that flower that Melchior stepped on...</p>
<p>East of here is Mt. Killaraus...</p>
<p>Now I&#39;m in control of Laphicet...</p>
<p>But I switch back to Rokurou after a battle...</p>
<p>Magilou&#39;s coughing at the hot steam from the geysers here. Eizen points out what I knew.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Mt. Killaraus is melting the bottom of the glacier.&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Of course, of course. The heat and the cold are engaged in a futile war. Just like someone I know.&quot; She means Velvet.</p>
<p>She also gets scorched by the hot water below the ice...</p>
<p>Oh, Magilou.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> (laughs warmly) &quot;Where&#39;s that famous apathy of yours today, Magilou?&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Who cares about apathy? Especially when I&#39;ve got friends [...] as you?&quot; Oh my god...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We climb a wall up to the cliff, heading back to the area before the west gate, but on higher ground.</p>
<p>We see the code red daemon there...</p>
<p>...along with lots of Katz spirits, a chest, and a Katz box!</p>
<p>After getting the treasures we fight against the <strong>Spectral Crystal!</strong> The Spectral Crystal has the lowest HP in this game: 765!</p>
<p>We try to strike the code red directly, no go! Our attacks bounce off of them...</p>
<p>They fire a range of non-elemental attacks: Void Sphere, Void Cannon, etc.</p>
<p>I decide to use the Spiked Shoes equipped on Rokurou and the Void Rings on other party members to bounce the daemon&#39;s attacks back on to them!</p>
<p>This monster&#39;s got the highest defense physically and magically!</p>
<p>How to fight this monster?</p>
<p>I decide to give up and run!</p>
<p>I grab the last chest here, which is a <strong>Mythril Garment!</strong></p>
<p>After some enhancements back in town, I return and proceed forward.</p>
<p>Laphicet points out the Scarlet Night. He&#39;s awed by its &quot;strange&quot; beauty. But he tells Velvet &quot;he&#39;s not happy about&quot; seeing one.</p>
<p>This night was the moment where Velvet&#39;s life went down the drain...</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Velvet smiles.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;If you&#39;re worried about Laphi or Celica, you don&#39;t need to be. I was just wondering what makes the moon turn so red.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor gives her the exorcists&#39; explanation.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;<strong>The crimson moon is a gate to beyond, and is proof of humanity&#39;s sins.</strong>&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;A sign of sin, eh? Maybe the moon drinks up the innocent blood spilled by the wicked.&quot; Eeee...</p>
<p>Eizen gives the scientific explanation.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;A Scarlet Night occurs whenever a full moon is in a certain position. The land and the moon pull at each other, and earthpulse energy spills into the sky, turning it red.&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Yes...the amount of power [it exudes] is said to create enough mana to affect even an Empyrean.&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen adds that what Rokurou said earlier makes sense, mentioning all of the wars and bloodshed the earthpulse has recorded...</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;A wild guess hits the mark!&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Don&#39;t get used to it.&quot;<br>
<strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;It sure does look grim though.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>
<p>I face off against the Spectral Crystal once again, and from reading the guide, I learn I can reflect the daemons attack using Rokurou&#39;s Vengeful Punishment when it tries to counter.</p>
<p>The first time I tried it, it worked, and the Spectral Crystal&#39;s taken care of!</p>
<p>We get a ventite that can set the battle difficulty up to Chaos mode!</p>
<p>So Vengeful Punishment works while Rokurou is hit while in Vengeful Stance mode...</p>
<p>After a battle we get an <strong>Aquamarine Waistcoat</strong>! Its description makes a nod to the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_dress_(viral_phenomenon)>blue or white-gold dress debate</a>...</p>

<p>I practice some more on Rokurou&#39;s Vengeful artes.</p>

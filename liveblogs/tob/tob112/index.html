<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>Off to Titania!</p>
<p>First, I check out the Beast Quarter...the scenery of Southgand carried over here...</p>
<p>To get to this zone, we used a small raft from the <em>Van Eltia</em>...</p>
<p>After rescuing the Katz, I visit around other towns to see if I missed a few sidequests. I also play some rounds of Character Cards...</p>
<p>Now for the long trip back...</p>
<p>There&#39;s Bienfu talking to a sylphjay, sending him a message.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;So it was you all along, Bienfu.&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou uses a detection arte and finds something in Bienfu.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;There is a geas on you, interfering with our pact. Heh, well played Melchior.&quot; What a chessmaster Melchior is...</p>
<p>Magilou takes out the geas (pronounced &quot;gesh&quot;) out of Bienfu...</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Impressive. [Melchior] must have planned all of this, from the very moment you escaped me...even my imprisonment in Titania and my encounter with Velvet...all calculated down to the minute. Huh. Nice.&quot;</p>
<p>So Bienfu would&#39;ve been treated worse by Melchior if he didn&#39;t spy on the crew...</p>
<p>And Magilou don&#39;t care about that. Magilou &quot;doesn&#39;t care that she doesn&#39;t care.&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou dances and says in a singsong voice that she&#39;s been spying for the Abbey. Nope. It&#39;s Bienfu.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Velvet and Phi heard everything.</p>
<p>Magilou takes the heat for Bienfu&#39;s espionage. Velvet don&#39;t care, since she knew that Magilou was dodgy from the moment they met.</p>
<p>Velvet tells her to &quot;fight for [the crew].&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;You&#39;re good at this cruelty-that&#39;s-also-compassion thing, aren&#39;t you?&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet has no time with her.</p>
<p>Magilou then gets serious. She asks Velvet a very abstract question.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;What does it feel like to...<strong>hate? Does it torment you? Is it agony? Does the searing fire of hatred empower you to feel? Does it give your life meaning where there was none?</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>We&#39;re almost close to the island...</p>
<p>And the Abbey&#39;s already inside.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;If you want your answer, fight by my side. You&#39;ll see it the very moment I kill [the Shepherd].&quot; Gulp...</p>
<p>She leaves.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;In the face of doom, still the crow caws defiantly...you really know how to vex me...&quot; The feeling&#39;s mutual, Magilou.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The ship goes around back.</p>
<p>Grim, Orthie, and Russ face off against the exorcists...</p>
<p><strong>Grimoirh:</strong> &quot;So you&#39;re using the forbidden artes? This has to be Melchior&#39;s doing...&quot; If what she means by &quot;forbidden artes&quot; is fusion...that&#39;s probably it...</p>
<p>Velvet does a spinning leap at the exorcists!</p>
<p>The exorcists now label her as &quot;The Lord of Calamity.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet calls that &quot;a melodramatic name.&quot;</p>
<p>The exorcists tell her to &quot;face the enormity of [her] sins.&quot; Your dear Shepherd goes first.</p>
<p>The melodramatic exorcists pull out their malakhim, and fuse!</p>
<p>We face a <strong>Pugilist Praetor</strong> and a <strong>Longbow Praetor</strong> and the fight is on!</p>
<p>Eleanor, to no avail, tries to stop them!</p>
<p>Velvet pulls out her arm, but she&#39;s getting dizzier...</p>
<p>Phi stands in front of her!</p>
<p>Eleanor, in shock, looks at the praetors. They&#39;ve collapsed as well...and they vanish!</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;They destroyed themselves.&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Just as I expected.&quot; How much do you know, Magilou?</p>
<p>Eleanor knows that the Abbey is weeding out their own numbers...</p>
<p>Velvet comes to and asks Grim where the therions are. They&#39;ve gone.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Grim&#39;s still focusing on the book so far...she&#39;s almost done with it.</p>
<p>She tells the crew to get aboard the ship.</p>
<p>Magilou sarcastically reminds her she&#39;s not fighting them alone.</p>
<p>Velvet leaves, but her headache grows worse...her brother&#39;s comb drops to the floor.</p>
<p>Phi reminds her that she&#39;s not alone in this fight.</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;I promise I&#39;ll protect you, Velvet.&quot; Awww...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;You&#39;ll protect me...Long ago, Laphi said the same thing...but that sort of idealistic drivel will kill you. They won&#39;t change reality. Look at what happened with Laphi. Dead...murdered!&quot; Oh my god.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;And I...I couldn&#39;t protect him either...In the end, no matter how much he cared for me...my only brother, he...His life torn away from him...&quot;</p>
<p>She faces Phi.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;You worry about yourself, Laphicet. That&#39;s an order.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh, we&#39;re still giving orders at this point?</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;We have to keep Innominat out of the picture...&quot;</p>
<p>Inside the prison now...</p>
<p>I turn back to the docks. Grim calls the Shepherd and Melchior &quot;naughty&quot; for messing with fusion.</p>
<p>The pirates curse the Abbey and give Eizen pep talks!</p>
<p>Dyle&#39;s injured. He tells us Kurogane has Kamoana and Medissa. But where&#39;s the prince and Griffin?</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Skit:</strong> Bienfu apologizes for being Melchior&#39;s spy. Magilou knows what he&#39;s about to say. She&#39;s smiling and looking away.</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s in shock!</p>
<p>Rokurou compliments Melchior&#39;s cleverness.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;After all, a forest is the best place to hide a tree.&quot;<br>
<strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;Melchior used his artes to place orders on Bienfu that overrode Magilou&#39;s pact.&quot;</p>
<p>Melchior, you are one clever jerk...</p>
<p>That&#39;s okay, Bienfu, we still love you.</p>
<p>Eizen and the rest forgive Bienfu easily because they know he&#39;s been forced to do Melchior&#39;s bidding, and he doesn&#39;t take too kindly to people&#39;s controlling people&#39;s destinies...</p>
<p>Rokurou mentions the Bloodwings were also a step ahead of us.</p>
<p>He asks Bienfu what he gave away to the Abbey.</p>
<p>Mostly personal stuff from Eizen to Dyle.</p>
<p>Eizen apologizes to Eleanor for his suspicions. So does Bienfu.</p>
<p><strong>Skit:</strong> Phi asks about fusion. If Eleanor were still with the Abbey, she would have been fusing as well. Character development yay!</p>
<p>She points out the logic on using fusions and the drawbacks...</p>
<p>The Abbey&#39;s now cornered, and this is their counterattack. This is one of the reasons why I called this part &quot;The Abbey Strikes Back.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou, though, mentions an alternative thought: the Abbey&#39;s testing fusions on us, and they want nothing to do with the therions.</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s in shock again at the carelessness of life from the Abbey.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;A blade proves its true worth by making it through battle unbroken.&quot;</p>
<p>She knows that&#39;s a logical thought, but it&#39;s not a good one.</p>
<p>Magilou&#39;s implying Velvet doesn&#39;t have plenty of time left...</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s now in killing mode...</p>
<p><a name=6></a></p>
<hr>
<p>There&#39;s <strong>Macrotian Wraiths</strong>, <strong>Gale Witches</strong>, <strong>Rigid Pythons</strong>, and more exorcist fusions invading to stop us!</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;First they rob the malakhim of their will and now their bodies too. Makes me sick.&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;...it fits their &#39;reason&#39;. They want strength and no arte can squeeze strength from a malak like that one.&quot;</p>
<p>After some shopping from a Turtlez, I grab a <strong>Demon&#39;s Cleaver</strong> from a chest.</p>
<p>There&#39;s Kurogane, Kamoana, and Medissa!</p>
<p>Kurogane&#39;s still ashamed...</p>
<p><strong>Kurogane:</strong> &quot;I have lost face.&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;You don&#39;t have a face!&quot;</p>
<p>Poor Kamoana...Medissa tries to comfort her.</p>
<p>Eleanor thanks Medissa for saving them.</p>
<p>Velvet orders them to escape to the south docks, and sail away if they find Prince Percival.</p>
<p>Kurogane hands Rokurou his finest masterpiece from the orichalcum: <strong>Stormquell.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;You actually did it!&quot;<br>
<strong>Kurogane:</strong> &quot;I abandoned all desire and forged it with a clear mind. You will find no harder sword in all the world.&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Stormquell...made from orichalcum...I&#39;ll use it well, Kurogane.&quot;</p>
<p>We get <strong>Stormquell!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Skit:</strong> Phi&#39;s overjoyed at seeing such a magnificent blade! Rokurou&#39;s excited too!</p>
<p>Bienfu and Eleanor are in awe of Kurogane&#39;s fine handiwork.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;The God Blade Stormhowl vs. the Orichalcum Stormquell. This will be something to see.&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;The gods alone know [how this will end].&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;The gods have nothing to do with it. Skill alone determines who lives and who dies.&quot;</p>
<p>We head deeper into the prison where we find the Prince and Griffin.</p>
<p><strong>Prince Percival:</strong> &quot;You did well to avoid the Shepherd and his forces.&quot; Coming from Prince Percival, that&#39;s the highest compliment ever.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;[The Shepherd] is here!?&quot;<br>
<strong>Prince:</strong> &quot;He is.&quot;</p>
<p><a name=7></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Velvet&#39;s now wanting to go after him.</p>
<p>Eizen&#39;s being cautious at this point.</p>
<p>Magilou tells the Prince they&#39;re leaving him behind if Griffin heads for the ship first.</p>
<p>Now let&#39;s get out of here!</p>
<p>Phi asks Eizen if the Shepherd&#39;s going to fuse to take care of us...Eizen&#39;s not sure. I&#39;m not sure what he will pull...</p>
<p>He probably won&#39;t since his reputation, according to Magilou, depends on him being alive.</p>
<p>But she points out that the risk might be lowered depending on how strong they are.</p>
<p>Rokurou thinks he will fuse with Innominat...oh boy...</p>
<p>Velvet knows he&#39;s going to fuse with Innominat. She&#39;s not going to underestimate him. He&#39;s going to use everything to finish off the Lord of Calamity.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Whether god or devil stands in his way, he won&#39;t be swayed. That&#39;s who he is.&quot; The Shepherd&#39;s lost all emotion to the point where he can be very powerful...</p>
<p>There&#39;s Benwick!</p>
<p>The Reaper&#39;s Curse rears its ugly head again as he tells us the exorcists have already gotten to the <em>Van Eltia</em>.</p>
<p>Eizen tells them to sail immediately!</p>
<p>Velvet stops.</p>
<p>Phi talks to her, happy that everyone&#39;s safe.</p>
<p>The exorcists come forth!</p>
<p>Velvet orders Benwick to leave her behind!</p>
<p><a name=8></a></p>
<hr>
<p>She&#39;s going to hold the fort from here!</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Tch...&quot; The crew joins her!</p>
<p>Eizen tells Benwick to set sail!</p>
<p>Benwick tells them not to die. We won&#39;t.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;We&#39;re not going to die. <strong>We&#39;re going to kill.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>We finish off the fused exorcists!</p>
<p>Velvet now decides to go to the front this time.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;To steal an Abbey ship, I take it.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor warns us the Abbey&#39;s over there, with the Shepherd leading the charge.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;All the better.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;If you want to die, do it alone.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;I&#39;m not asking you to come with me.&quot; Oh boy...personality-wise, she is like Korra, imo...</p>
<p>Then Prince Percival comes forth. He asks the crew to use him as a hostage.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Looks like this is our best and only bet.&quot;</p>

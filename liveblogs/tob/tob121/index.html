<p>As we head to the inn, Rokurou&#39;s lucky Magilou hasn&#39;t won her bet against Velvet. I&#39;m thinking the bet&#39;s not over...</p>
<p>Now Magilou tells Rokurou and Eizen they owe her money. Eizen decides to make another bet. Rokurou bets against Velvet for 10,000. So does Eizen. But Magilou sees what they&#39;re plotting.</p>
<p>Eizen baits her into backing off, but Magilou proceeds into going with that bet. 10,000 that Velvet wins her revenge. Rokurou and Eizen laugh. You guys...</p>
<p>Magilou thinks &quot;calling a witch cute&quot; is &quot;slander&quot;.</p>
<p>A townswoman&#39;s worried about Shigure. Since he goes out almost shirtless, she worries about him...</p>
<p>In the inn, a man notices that Aifread&#39;s pirates are assisting the Lord of Calamity&#39;s quest. The man explains Aifread&#39;s ambush by Melchior. But he forgets that even without the captain, Aifread&#39;s crew is still effective as ever...</p>
<p>We rest up.</p>

<p>Another dream, where Velvet and Seres sit at opposite ends of a table...</p>
<p>Velvet asks Seres if she could &quot;think of Seres as her sister.&quot;</p>
<p>Seres shakes her head. It&#39;s her memories of being Velvet&#39;s sister in a past life that keep her going...</p>
<p>Seres asks a pretty insightful question here...</p>
<p><strong>Seres:</strong> &quot;What defines a person&#39;s identity? I may have her body and her memories but..&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;You&#39;re right. If your soul has changed, then you&#39;re probably not the same person anymore.&quot;</p>
<p>Seres even says she shouldn&#39;t be labeled as Velvet&#39;s sister at all.</p>
<p>She points out what Velvet did was because she asked Velvet to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Seres:</strong> &quot;I wanted you to have my power. Right after the Advent...Celica&#39;s memories returned to me.&quot;</p>
<p>She transforms into Celica!</p>
<p><strong>Celica:</strong> &quot;It was then I understood what exactly it was I had done. Arthur, kind and caring...&quot;<br>
<strong>Seres:</strong> &quot;Transformed into the cruel Artorius he is now.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet asks why her memories came back. Seres has no clue. But it&#39;s for a rare moment.</p>
<p><strong>Celica:</strong> &quot;Or perhaps this is my punishment for the pain I brought to you all. The stronger I feel my love for Arthur, the less I can forgive Artorius...&quot;<br>
<strong>Seres:</strong> &quot;My hatred of him has grown so deep I&#39;m not Celica anymore.&quot;</p>
<p>So she called on Velvet to fulfill Celica&#39;s last will for her: <strong>to finish off the Shepherd.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;I know. I will stop him.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Celica:</strong> &quot;<strong>Forgive me, Velvet. I&#39;ve pushed everything onto you...My hatred, my determination...</strong>I wanted to apologize one last time... At the end...&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;I&#39;m glad that I had a chance to know you. I&#39;m glad that once I could be Laphi&#39;s sister...and Celica and Arthur&#39;s sister as well...I was happy.&quot; <img class=emojione alt=☹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>

<hr>
<p>Now at night, Velvet is surrounded by a purple aura. Malevolence!</p>
<p>Phi wakes up.</p>
<p>Velvet turns around.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s finally come to this. But of course it did. After all, I chose my revenge over a world of peace. I can&#39;t complain if people call me &#39;The Lord of Calamity.&#39;&quot;</p>
<p>Phi moves closer.</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;Velvet, whether you&#39;re human, daemon, or Lord of Calamity...it doesn&#39;t change that you have beautiful hair.&quot;</p>
<p>He pulls out the comb she dropped.</p>
<p>She points out her brother said that exact thing, and bought her that comb.</p>
<p>Phi senses her heartache.</p>
<p>Looks like she&#39;s going full throttle with her revenge quest!</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>I&#39;m going to settle things with the Shepherd and Innominat. Once and for all.</strong> It must be done. For my sake...and for the sake of those I loved.&quot;</p>
<p>So will Phi.</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;Even without my compass, I&#39;ll take the wheel and chart my own course.&quot; </p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s now thinking about what will happen to her, the therions, and the malakhim if she takes care of Innominat. No... <img class=emojione alt=☹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>The rest of the party&#39;s watching them.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Zaveid, up and about, is fired up! He yells at Eizen for not warning him! Rokurou gets in between them...</p>
<p>Zaveid runs off...</p>
<p>Eizen&#39;s crew is already on their way, but more news has come up. Rokurou tells us: Aifread&#39;s in Endgand, in Lionel Island!</p>
<p>Eizen thinks it&#39;s a trap by Melchior&#39;s bodyguard daemon, who&#39;s probably, according to Eizen, Aifread himself. Eizen does not want to admit that the daemon is him...</p>
<p>Phi and Eleanor are shocked!</p>
<p>Magilou, with a smile on her face, asks Eizen if that is Aifread.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;I said &#39;may.&#39;&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet decides to steal a ship!</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;I may be a calamity, but I&#39;m frugal.&quot;</p>
<p>More talk about the Prince back at Loegres. They also think Velvet&#39;s crew&#39;s finished.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;The Abbey&#39;s propaganda at work again, I see...&quot;</p>
<p>That makes things easier.</p>
<p>But one sailor thinks the Lord of Calamity is still alive, from seeing a pirate ship sail away from Titania...</p>
<p>The woman&#39;s frightened. The sailor thinks the Abbey better step up their game.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Go ahead, talk all you like.&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen&#39;s cursing at himself for not noticing Aifread earlier at Hexen Isle.</p>
<p>The woman thinks the Lord of Calamity&#39;s fate is rather sad...</p>
<p>Another sailor near the docks mentions Abbey navy sailing near Hexen Isle, or the Sea of No Return, keeping Hexen Isle secret.</p>
<p>Looks like tons of rumors about the Sea of No Return south is spreading. One mentions a dragon swallowing a ship whole!</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;The Sea of No Return. What a poetic name.&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;For the malakhim taken there, that poem is a tragic one.&quot;</p>

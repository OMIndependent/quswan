<p>The game introduces us to back attacks and first strikes, along with a &quot;perilous encounter&quot; or a &quot;linked battle,&quot; if I encounter two or more enemies on the field at once...</p>
<p><strong>Skit:</strong> Rokurou and Velvet ask Magilou why she came back with them. For kicks, according to her. </p>
<p>The &quot;traitor&quot; she&#39;s looking for left town again. </p>
<p>Velvet asks if she could use her magic. No dice. </p>
<p>She needs her &quot;backstabbing slippery assistant&quot; for that. Rokurou rightfully calls her a &quot;con artist.&quot; She resents that label.</p>
<p>Rokurou asks if she &quot;has a home to return to.&quot; Nope, she says, smiling. </p>
<p>Laphicet feels sorry for her. It&#39;s the first time he&#39;s ever felt pity for someone...</p>
<p>And there&#39;s a save point!</p>
<p><strong>Danaan Highway</strong>&#39;s the picture of perfect spring scenery, with tons of tall grass and blooming flowers. It really makes me wish I could take screencaps in this game. <a href=https://youtu.be/i_BayXuJpiU>Here&#39;s the music for it.</a></p>
<p>While fighting a bunch of <strong>Snakes</strong>, Velvet unleashes her Mystic Arte for the first time!</p>
<p>Eizen also unleashes his Mystic Arte at another battle with <strong>Gibbons</strong>!</p>
<p>We&#39;re also getting new weapons and equipment fighting these monsters!</p>
<p>And I unlock Rokurou&#39;s <strong>Mystic Arte!</strong></p>
<p>After a few battles, our expedition has returned! We get a new recipe: a <strong>Fresh Fish Pirate Platter</strong>!</p>
<p>We take the eastern way...</p>

<hr>
<p>Crossing a bridge, Laphicet is amazed at the giant walls of Loegres. Magilou points out the ugly truth about how those walls were built.</p>
<p>Laphicet did go there, but it&#39;s the first time he&#39;s seen Loegres as a free malak...poor him. Malakhim bound to exorcists weren&#39;t even <strong>allowed</strong> to take in and enjoy their surroundings... <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Magilou&#39;s smiling when she says that &quot;[the party] will lose that freedom&quot; too. How much does she know? I think I changed my mind about Rokurou being the traitor. I&#39;m more suspicious of Magilou.</p>
<p>She points out there&#39;s a lot of Abbey forces. &quot;[No] place for a collection of villains like them,&quot; indeed.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a lot of people outside the gates wanting to get in for the ceremony...</p>
<p>Guards are blocking the way to the Galles Lake Road. That&#39;s probably where the code red daemon is, I&#39;m thinking.</p>
<p>I explore some more, and see some tents pitched up...the road forward leads to the <strong>Aldina Plains</strong>, where there&#39;s a travel ban in place going there.</p>
<p>&quot;Trust in the wisdom of the Abbey,&quot; one soldier says to a peddler trying to pass through. they even call those settlements there &quot;few.&quot; My god...</p>
<p>And on the way back, I get my first dangerous encounter!</p>
<p>I open another Katz box, and get a Top Hat as a prize!</p>
<p>More exploring...</p>
<p>Now we come across a very stringent inspection. Eizen tells everyone to act natural.</p>
<p>Rokurou sees Velvet&#39;s tense. She knows it.</p>
<p>The guard notices Velvet!</p>

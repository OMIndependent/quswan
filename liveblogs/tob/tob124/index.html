<p>The pirates want some action!</p>
<p>Grim&#39;s pointing out the super-ridiculousness of the crew&#39;s whole plan, but she finds it &quot;rather thrilling.&quot; Once in a lifetime, Grim.</p>
<p>Velvet asks if Benwick&#39;s bearing any grudges to the crew.</p>
<p>Benwick&#39;s moved on pretty quickly. He&#39;s well aware of how the whole fight went, I&#39;m guessing.</p>
<p><strong>Benwick:</strong> &quot;The first mate fought like the first mate. The captain died like the captain.&quot; He&#39;s trying to keep their captain&#39;s honor. Aifread&#39;s crew goes on with or without their captain.</p>
<p><strong>Benwick:</strong> &quot;We&#39;re Aifread&#39;s pirates and don&#39;t forget it! We&#39;re not so pathetic that we need pity from some Lord of Calamity!&quot; Heh.</p>
<p>Another <strong>skit:</strong> Eleanor points out that with Captain Aifread gone, the mood around the ship feels &quot;different.&quot;</p>
<p>The remaining pirates are taking it hard, but they do their jobs...</p>
<p>Velvet and Rokurou both agree that they have to press onwards regardless.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Following a creed isn&#39;t always pleasant. We must do what we must.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;I won&#39;t allow the Abbey to do things like this!&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Destroying someone like that. Turning them into a puppet. It&#39;s [unforgivable].&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou mentions that a heart can be controlled, but never &quot;erased&quot; or destroyed. Aifread went down like the honorable pirate that he is. He definitely <strong>is</strong> too awesome for this game.</p>
<p>Velvet grits her teeth, saying &quot;the heart is eternal.&quot;</p>
<p>Now for some Class 4 Zones to take care of...</p>
<p>I make for Hellawes as our next stop!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Velvet&#39;s pondering...Kamoana and Phi are chatting, with Eleanor looking on. Eizen sends a sylphjay...</p>
<p>Rokurou tells Kurogane about what happened in his last duel with Shigure.</p>
<p><strong>Kurogane:</strong> &quot;I see. Orichalcum or not, Stormquell snapped like a twig.&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;It was Innominat who did it, but I think Shigure could have done the same.&quot;</p>
<p>Kurogane&#39;s realizing he needs to make his weapons flexible...</p>
<p>Rokurou encourages Kurogane, saying he&#39;s &quot;the greatest swordsman in the world.&quot;</p>
<p>Kurogane&#39;s a bit surprised that Rokurou trusts him to craft his weapons.</p>
<p>By his poses, Rokurou&#39;s a bit impatient, but he continues cheering up Kurogane, since he&#39;s the only one &quot;who can craft a blade out of orichalcum.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou praises Kurogane for his dedication to swordsmithing, lauding him as &quot;a visionary who spent centuries&quot; trying to make a sword to counter Stormquell.</p>
<p>Kurogane&#39;s speechless at Rokurou&#39;s words...</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> (smiling) &quot;Unless, of course, you&#39;ve given up on making a sword to surpass Stormhowl?&quot;</p>
<p>Kurogane chuckles, putting his giant armored hand behind where his head used to be.</p>
<p><strong>Kurogane:</strong> &quot;Does this look like the face of a swordsmith who has given up?&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou laughs warmly.</p>
<p>Kamoana&#39;s showing Magilou, Medissa, and Benwick a patty cake trick...</p>
<p>Now the crew&#39;s concerns are mostly on that Suppression Ceremony.</p>
<p>Velvet knows that ceremony is going to be where Innominat will use his full power.</p>
<p>Right now, Innominat has not taken the malevolence of despair from Velvet nor has he taken care of Phi yet. Eizen&#39;s worried about the disastrous results when Innominat is at full power.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Humanity will be robbed of their free will.&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou imagines up the so-called jubilating headlines about people&#39;s free will being sapped from the masses that will be published.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;And the world is free of malevolence! Hurrah, hurrah!&quot;</p>
<p>Everyone will end up becoming like Laphicet pre-Velvet... <img class=emojione alt=☹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Phi sees something!</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Another animated cutscene plays...it&#39;s been awhile!</p>
<p>It&#39;s Griffin flying!</p>
<p><strong>Oh my god!</strong></p>
<p>That golden barrier, or the domain&#39;s, spreading again!</p>
<p>All of the people in Loegres have the energy and excitement sapped from out of them...they look completely robbed of life inside...</p>
<p>They now walk in straight lines...</p>
<p>In Port Zekson, sailors prep their fists...</p>
<p>...and the domain spreads, stopping them. It reminds me of the Curtain of Cruelty, but this is more like a Curtain of Soullessness.</p>
<p>Now the domain&#39;s reached the <em>Van Eltia!</em></p>
<p>The pirates aren&#39;t immune to Innominat&#39;s domain...</p>
<p>Magilou says that Innominat isn&#39;t at full power and tells Rokurou to &quot;wake [the pirates] up&quot; with a slugging!</p>
<p>Eizen docks the ship at Midgand!</p>
<p><strong>Benwick:</strong> &quot;I feel like some jerk played tug of war with my brain.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;They&#39;re trying to strip away your will!&quot;</p>
<p>The port&#39;s getting foggy.</p>
<p>Phi&#39;s getting worried again.</p>
<p>Oh my god!</p>
<p>The citizens are in single file!</p>
<p>The merchant&#39;s not safe from the effects of the domain either! He&#39;s almost like what Velvet was back at the earthpulse...</p>
<p>Oh no, he&#39;s walking to the edge of the pier! Eleanor runs after him!</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Velvet slugs the merchant!</p>
<p>Velvet does not like it when people &quot;have&quot; to die.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Those awakened to their own malevolence seek to end their lives. Welcome to [the Shepherd]&#39;s uncompromising world of &#39;reason.&#39;&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen really doesn&#39;t like it when people are robbed of their free will. Eizen&#39;s probably going to be the first to break free of Drosselmeyer if he was ever written into one of his stories...</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s ready to see what the Abbey truly is for herself.</p>
<p>Velvet decides to head to the capital.</p>
<p><strong>Skit: Suppressed World, Ideal World</strong></p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Innominat&#39;s suppression...is this the ideal world the Abbey envisions?&quot;</p>
<p>Bienfu also sees the &quot;life&quot; in everyone is gone!</p>
<p>Phi&#39;s so sad... <img class=emojione alt=☹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Magilou points out the &quot;logical conclusion&quot; that Melchior reached.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;What utter rubbish.&quot;</p>
<p>Another <strong>skit: Innominat&#39;s Expanding Domain</strong></p>
<p>Bienfu continues being sad and worried about the rest of the world.</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;When Innominat&#39;s domain expanded, I felt a [...] power suddenly come closer.&quot; Oh no...</p>
<p>Magilou points out Innominat&#39;s domain has touched nearly all of Midgand.</p>
<p>Eleanor reaches the conclusion that this domain is affecting the whole world...</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Innominat created this ideal hell in a single moment. That&#39;s the power we&#39;re up against.&quot; If this is what Rokurou calls &quot;hell&quot;...I would imagine hell being worse than this...</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;So we few are standing against a truly monumental force.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet tells her she &quot;can turn back&quot; if she wants. But to where, or what?</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;At least this way, I&#39;ll have my own free will. I&#39;d prefer a living damnation to that oblivion.&quot;</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Up the steps, where we see the populace crowded up in a perfect square.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;So this is the result of their Ceremony of Suppression.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;They&#39;ve brought their &#39;peace&#39; to mankind.&quot;</p>
<p>Everyone&#39;s a living zombie...</p>
<p>One pirate, who&#39;s woken up from the domain blames either Innominat or Rokurou for his slight headache...</p>
<p>At least the Katz are immune to the domain...</p>
<p>The townspeople even want to toss pets aside...</p>
<p>I check the menu. The crew&#39;s all at level 50!</p>
<p>I also read the parts of the synopsis I forgot to read. </p>
<p>Eizen and Rokurou are really intimidated by Teresa&#39;s cold stare...</p>
<p>Poor Phi...during the events of Titania where we first see Innominat, Velvet&#39;s pushing people away...</p>
<p><strong>Hatred</strong> and <strong>despair</strong> are confirmed to be the types of malevolence that Innominat&#39;s missing. Velvet&#39;s still got her hatred, but her despair is gone, and Innominat is trying to reawaken that in her...</p>
<p>The illusion in Aball and the deaths of Oscar and Teresa were the events that caused Velvet to slump into despair...</p>
<p>I find out that Innominat did devour her hatred, which is the Chimera we fought and he ate in the earthpulse.</p>
<p>So Velvet&#39;s quest of vengeance is all for her now. Not for anyone else, but for her alone...</p>
<p>At the last chapter of the synopsis Magilou can&#39;t decide whether Velvet or Innominat&#39;s scarier...becoming a logical zombie or having a therion KO one in the face?</p>
<p><a name=6></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The shrewd merchant trying to sell chalices to Innominat is now regretting his decision. He now decides to be a priest...oh my god...</p>
<p>Magilou calls him &quot;pure and shiny.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet calls it &quot;nauseating.&quot; Hee..</p>
<p>Even the inn&#39;s filled with people who decide to listen to &quot;reason&quot;...</p>
<p>The sailor in the inn who got addicted to Nectar now decides to throw away all of the drinks in the port!</p>
<p>The sailor decides on freedom. Rokurou complains that that should come the morning after.</p>
<p>Even Eizen thinks drinking is a better choice rather than submitting to the domain...that&#39;s how bad Innominat&#39;s domain is according to him...</p>
<p>The merchant&#39;s apologizing for asking Magilou&#39;s Menagerie for Velvet&#39;s dove impressions...Velvet&#39;s not sure whether to be &quot;angry&quot; or &quot;confused.&quot;</p>
<p>He asks Velvet to &quot;make [him] disappear forever.&quot;</p>
<p>There&#39;s even a man about to jump off the bridge to the town! No!</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;This isn&#39;t someone accepting that they&#39;ll grow old, this is him refusing to grow old.&quot;</p>
<p>Before the gates to Loegres, a dad and his daughter are deciding to abandon their dog...</p>
<p>The daughter threw away her friends&#39; pets too!</p>
<p>Even pets are considered to be like malakhim bound by exorcists...</p>
<p>Flowers are considered &quot;distractions&quot; too...</p>
<p>Even the Prince&#39;s admirers have fallen under the domain&#39;s effects, saying they should only marry someone in the same class as theirs...</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s &quot;creeped out&quot; by the way the admirer says these things, though she agrees with what she says.</p>
<p>The stubborn architect&#39;s resisting a bit...</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Even the capital&#39;s as silent as death...&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Innominat&#39;s power did all of this. A god among gods.&quot;</p>
<p>A woman and her friend are also resisting a bit...</p>
<p>Even the priests are not immune.</p>
<p>Some pockets of resistance are here, but they&#39;ve been suppressed.</p>
<p><a name=7></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The believers are wanting not only to destroy the fountain, but the decorations on the houses and streets too!</p>
<p>The fundie youth&#39;s inside the tavern, with soldiers in tow!</p>
<p><strong>Youth:</strong> &quot;Taverns shall now only live on in history books.&quot;</p>
<p>The merchant there now declares taverns as equal food distribution centers...eeee...</p>
<p>Phi tries to argue with him once again about food as &quot;a part of being alive.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;If you cant enjoy your food, how can you enjoy your life?&quot;</p>
<p>The tavernkeeper&#39;s trying to resist the domain, he tells Tabatha and his family to forgive him...</p>
<p>The Bloodwings have also committed suicide in the bedroom upstairs. One agent&#39;s scared and pleads for her mother...she&#39;s almost breaking free.</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;Isn&#39;t there anyone who hasn&#39;t lost their free will?&quot;</p>
<p>We hear a girl crying.</p>
<p>There&#39;s Prince Percival and Tabatha!</p>
<p>Tabatha tells her &quot;not to show&quot; emotion.</p>
<p>And come down three flying angels with large scepters!</p>
<p>Now we fight one angel, or a <strong>Minion of Prophecy!</strong> This must be one of Innominat&#39;s malakhim police!</p>
<p>Tabatha&#39;s fine, but the Prince and the girl are gone!</p>
<p>She tells us that anyone who kept their free will were taken away to the castle villa.</p>
<p>Phi suggests going through the sewers again.</p>
<p>Rokurou, you smiling daemon, you...</p>

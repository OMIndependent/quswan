<p>They&#39;re in!</p>
<p>But the guard stops Velvet and asks her for their papers, or an Abbey travel permit, to be exact.</p>
<p>Magilou then takes center stage, reprimanding Velvet as a &quot;magician&#39;s apprentice.&quot;</p>
<p>She calls her troupe &quot;Magilou&#39;s Menagerie.&quot; As proof, she tells Velvet to do a &quot;magic trick with doves.&quot; Velvet forgot how.</p>
<p>Magilou demands that &quot;<strong>[Velvet]. Acts. Like. A. Dove.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet does a very bad impersonation of a dove, &quot;coo..coo.&quot; Lol...poor her...</p>
<p>Magilou showers doves and confetti! Holy heck, she is a magician!</p>
<p>The guard tells her to move along, no advertisements.</p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s amazed at her tricks. Velvet&#39;s not happy. She calls their defenses &quot;pathetic.&quot; No, the inspections, according to Magilou, are proof of their &quot;confidence.&quot;</p>
<p>So there&#39;s two whole fleets of guards and a thousand exorcists...oh my god...</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s thinking they need papers to show.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Rokurou and Magilou point out the grandness of the ceremony, indicating the peace brought by the Abbey. But, it came at a price...</p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s worried...</p>
<p>The second expedition&#39;s finished. It&#39;s a success, and I&#39;m reading through the dialogue between Velvet and Rokurou over the treasure the scout ship found: a pendant. </p>
<p>Velvet doesn&#39;t think of it as valuable. But Rokurou...oh my god, he&#39;s digging himself deeper in his dialogue to Velvet...</p>
<p>I save at the main square, before a fleet of soldiers in formation.</p>
<p>My lord, the villa looks grandiose...</p>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/tWYnfN2KvGo>Here&#39;s the music for Loegres.</a></p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Now we explore around the city, looking for more info.</p>
<p>Rokurou asks an old man, a big devotee of the Abbey, about the Abbey&#39;s structure. Eizen explains. </p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;The Abbey is part of Midgand&#39;s Church of the Empyreans. Originally, it was an order of paladins and warrior priests devoted to exorcising evil.&quot; So the Abbey, or the Exorcist&#39;s Abbey of the Church of Midgand, existed long before the Advent, huh? </p>
<p>Rokurou doesn&#39;t see them as a humble organization, even though they&#39;re a notable branch of the church nowadays. All because of <strong>that man</strong>.</p>
<p>So the high priest gave all his power to <strong>that man</strong>. Plus, the prince of Midgand, according to Laphicet, gave him full military and government powers, and now, <strong>that man</strong> controls all of Midgand. Wow. So he probably used Velvet and sacrificed her brother for this power.</p>
<p>The delivery of Rokurou&#39;s last line here sort of made me laugh a bit: &quot;Okay, got it. The Abbey&#39;s a big deal.&quot;</p>
<p>We speak to another citizen, who admires the prince. The Prince of Midgand is <strong>Prince Percival</strong>. Where&#39;s the king? </p>
<p>The king&#39;s retired and the prince is in charge of running Midgand.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;He declared that a new way of thinking was needed to save the world from this crisis.&quot; My god. So the prince is working hand in hand with <strong>that man</strong> too.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;...So all of Midgand is on Artorius&#39;s side.&quot; He&#39;s got plenty of good publicity.</p>
<p>We speak to her again. She mentions the prince and that man being single. She asks if that man had &quot;a special someone.&quot; Velvet responds that &quot;he threw it all away.&quot; Does that mean <strong>that man</strong> sacrificed Celica too?</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>There&#39;s guards drilling for a parade for the ceremony too...</p>
<p>There&#39;s a girl sitting on a bench with her mother who&#39;s excited about the exorcists and the Prince speaking. She wants to thank <strong>that man</strong>. Mom agrees.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;[The exorcists] sure are popular.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> “Because these people don&#39;t know the truth.”</p>
<p>Magilou also brings up another truth. In a serious voice, she says the exorcists are fighting daemons because ordinary people can&#39;t. Hence why they&#39;re grateful to them. Velvet sulks.</p>
<p>The girl on the bench hates being selfish. Mom laughs, all this to keep them safe. </p>
<p>Wow, the influence of Midgand&#39;s Church is wide...</p>
<p>One man says the parade is but a &quot;show of force to [him].&quot; It definitely is a power play to the citizens. The bold man even doubts that some joined the Abbey out of &quot;virtue and goodness.&quot;</p>
<p>We go to another weapon shop, which has been around for a century...</p>
<p>More exploring...</p>
<p>There&#39;s a merchant talking to a priest about church improvements by giving him a loan from his guild...</p>
<p>Other observers are watching the practice drills with awe in their eyes.</p>
<p>We now climb the steps up to the castle plaza.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>There&#39;s a choir chanting &quot;Midgand!&quot; Magilou points out the royalty has the citizenry wrapped around their finger.</p>
<p>The crown prince of the <strong>Midgand Empire, Percival Asgard</strong>, speaks.</p>
<p>Where is he?</p>
<p>But the ceremony&#39;s officially begun. And I&#39;m playing this part on the same day the Winter Olympics are having theirs.</p>
<p>Prince mentions the awful tragedies of daemons and daemonblight.</p>
<p>Velvet notices <strong>him</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Prince:</strong> &quot;...and the name of that man...was <strong>Artorius Collbrande!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet runs up the steps. No! Not now!</p>
<p>The prince mentioned how much Artorius sacrificed everything. Velvet points out the truth in her head.</p>
<p><strong>Prince:</strong> &quot;He called <strong>Lord Innominat, one of the Five Empyreans</strong>, and blessed us with the strength of malakhim.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet climbs the wall, but slips...</p>
<p>Laphicet sees her.</p>
<p><strong>Prince:</strong> &quot;He serves as a shining beacon of Reason in this world of turmoil. And Reason is what binds us.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> (thinking) &quot;<strong>But you killed him! You took everything that I loved!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet climbs.</p>
<p><strong>Prince:</strong> &quot;<strong>So raise your voices in praise to Artorius&#39;s devoted work, to the savior who purifies evil and guides our flock! Let us call him</strong> <strong><em>our Shepherd!</em></strong>&quot; Wow...</p>
<p>So Artorius is given the role that Fberl (ciphered name) eventually takes on in <strong>Zestiria</strong>...</p>
<p>The crowd praises him as &quot;<strong>Shepherd Artorius.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Now another cutscene where we see the prince.</p>
<p>Oh my god! Here he comes in glorious white and gold, the new <strong>Shepherd, Artorius Collbrande!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Artorius:</strong> &quot;<strong>Even though the world was filled with suffering I had to ask something tremendous of you all. I entrusted you to endure the pains of Reason. I asked you to bind yourselves with shackles of your own will!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>There&#39;s Oscar, and Teresa, and an elderly priest in between them...</p>
<p><strong>Artorius:</strong> &quot;<strong>For the only blade that can expel calamity...is one forged from unshaking reason...and the iron will to do what must be done!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>He does look and sound like a fancier Lhev-meets-Inabaqbes (ciphered names to prevent spoilers from other <em>Tales</em> games) with holy garb here.</p>
<p>He raises his fist.</p>
<p><strong>Artorius:</strong> &quot;<strong>And now, that blade stands ready...before all of us today! I offer my body and my life in service to the people of this great land! With the blessings of the Empyrean Innominat, I will guide you to a world without calamity! And this world&#39;s suffering...will be nothing but a distant memory!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>The crowd cheers.</p>
<p>And Velvet&#39;s still seething.</p>
<p>Rokurou lowers her down...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>You&#39;re the one who killed Laphicet!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s shocked and confused...</p>
<p>Her daemon fist&#39;s bleeding...</p>
<p><a name=6></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> With this post, it seems that I&#39;ve reached 3,000 comments!</p>
<p>Back at the alley, the gang huddles.</p>
<p>Velvet says she &quot;needs a sword of reason and will&quot; to stop him. Malak!Laphicet&#39;s in shock...</p>
<p>And Magilou leaves us again...her farewell greeting&#39;s a bit darkly funny.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;May your days be fruitful and your nights tormented!&quot; Good riddance.</p>
<p>Rokurou says they should play it slow since <strong>that man</strong>&#39;s out in the open.</p>
<p>The bearded old priest in between Oscar and Teresa is <strong>Melchior</strong>, according to Eizen.</p>
<p>Eizen suggests scouting for info. Rokurou agrees. Velvet asks if Eizen has connections in the city. Not much, but Aifread&#39;s close to a shadow guild...</p>
<p>So we have to go to Baskerville&#39;s tavern next.</p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s hungry.</p>
<p><a name=7></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Skit:</strong> Rokurou points out the full might of the army seeing <strong>that man</strong>&#39;s position as Shepherd. </p>
<p>Eizen asks about Rokurou&#39;s target. He&#39;s not there. His &quot;target&quot; doesn&#39;t go out into ceremonies since he doesn&#39;t care about the rank of being an exorcist, or rather, the ceremonial part of it, I&#39;m guessing.</p>
<p>Rokurou notices <strong>that man</strong>&#39;s right arm was injured. Velvet confirms that he got injured with that arm. But, he&#39;s still dangerous with his left. Rokurou has good insight. He even mentions <strong>that man</strong>&#39;s &quot;chi&quot; located &quot;below his navel.&quot; Laphicet asks about that too. Rokurou points out that even when he looks relaxed, he&#39;s always on guard.</p>
<p>My god, it was his insight that made me peg Rokurou as a traitor at first, but it wasn&#39;t because he had extra info. He&#39;s just that good at analyzing things. </p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s devoted to taking on the Shepherd as well, with a daring grin on his face.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/auoFaiu.png alt="rokurou grin" width=480 height=270></p>
<p>One noble&#39;s questioning a local soldier how much power they&#39;re going to give <strong>that man</strong> in a fortnight. Even I&#39;m concerned too. The soldier says the usual &quot;it&#39;s necessary&quot; line, even though some soldiers aren&#39;t okay with it.</p>
<p>Someone&#39;s reporting to an exorcist that the Gate&#39;s fallen...</p>
<p>People are now talking about Artorius&#39;s speech, mentioning &quot;the sword of will and reason&quot; line.</p>
<p>Looks like the Church of Midgand&#39;s gaining more followers and the devoted are getting more devoted...</p>
<p>The area to the east is now open.</p>
<p>A devotee of the Church is in awe at the new label royalty&#39;s given <strong>that man</strong>, thinking that with him, the Era of Disaster will end...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>Shepherd Artorius?</strong>&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;<strong>How pompous can you get?</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen points out that <strong>that man</strong> has full control of both the &quot;religious and secular power in Midgand,&quot; and has &quot;become the very hope of the masses.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;A dangerous opponent indeed.&quot; Understatement of the century.</p>
<p>Laphicet asks Velvet if she&#39;s still going to fight him. Her answer is a brusque yes.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;He could be a god for all I care. <strong>I&#39;ll have my vengeance, no matter what.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><a name=8></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Everyone&#39;s singing praises of <strong>that man</strong> and the speech that he made.</p>
<p>We head to the cathedral.</p>
<p>We overhear a family lauding the Shepherd. The woman there&#39;s moved to tears at the short speech. The son&#39;s devoted to helping the Abbey. The girl wants to marry <strong>that man</strong> when she grows up. If only she knew the truth about him...</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Now that&#39;s popularity.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Ignorance is bliss.&quot;</p>
<p>Now everyone&#39;s more focused on &quot;order&quot; and &quot;will.&quot;</p>
<p>One of the nobles mentions Oscar as a praetor. He doesn&#39;t have any good labels to put on him, thinking the Dragonias were doing this just to get him close to the Shepherd. Velvet notices this too. So the Dragonias are a rich family...</p>
<p>Some of the clergy&#39;s not happy with the power <strong>that man</strong>&#39;s gotten...</p>
<p>I go in the Cathedral. <a href=https://youtu.be/cv6TWfwVDBQ>That grand holy music plays again...</a></p>
<p>One in the front pew&#39;s praying to the Empyrean, and would gladly give money every month.</p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s impressed by the cathedral. So&#39;s Laphicet. Eizen notes that malak didn&#39;t build this chapel, but the current engineering and tech at the time did. Eizen goes on to praise the architecture of the place.</p>
<p>No actual Empyreans are in the cathedral, but it&#39;s a symbolic gesture, Eizen says. The cathedral&#39;s a symbol &quot;to celebrate the continent&#39;s unification.&quot; </p>
<p>Velvet calls it what it is: &quot;A show of power.&quot; Yep.</p>
<p>And the cathedral&#39;s not finished! It&#39;s sort of in the same situation as the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagrada_Familia>Sagrada Familia</a>...</p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s shocked by how long it&#39;ll take for the cathedral to be finished. <strong>Centuries...</strong> Velvet&#39;s next response takes the cake.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;The daemon and the reaper are shaking their heads at this overwrought monstrosity. Intrinsic worth: zero.&quot; <strong>Damn.</strong></p>
<p>We talk to more people, and a priest who demands penance and prayer after seeing Velvet&#39;s wardrobe. Velvet is not happy. Oh my goodness, this priest... *smh*</p>
<p>Velvet starts confessing her sins. <strong>All of them.</strong> </p>
<p>She starts with what she did in Titania, Hellawes, and finally, Vortigern. The priest is sweating, saying she should turn herself in to the Abbey.</p>
<p>Velvet gets honest, and says that she&#39;s going after Artorius. </p>
<p>The priest calls for an exorcist! Velvet knew that would happen.</p>

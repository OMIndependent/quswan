<p>Now off to the last stratum of this complicated earthpulse...</p>
<p>Rokurou double-checks about humans being born into malakhim &quot;given the right [conditions].&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Is that something that happens frequently?&quot; Eizen doesn&#39;t know.</p>
<p>So it&#39;s probably rare that humans are reincarnated as malakhim.</p>
<p>Eizen thinks that Seres and Phi were born not out of chance, but by the high resonance of the Scarlet Night...</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Are you saying that Innominat made it happen on purpose?&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen thinks that&#39;s an educated guess regarding their birth on Scarlet Night.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;If it wasn&#39;t chance it might&#39;ve been destiny.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s not too happy with Rokurou&#39;s guess, mentioning Velvet consuming Seres. Rokurou apologizes.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;But our fates intertwine, whether good or bad, whether we like it or not. That&#39;s what makes it destiny right?&quot;</p>
<p>Looks like Eleanor&#39;s the only one that can get them out of their slumps...</p>
<p>We see Magilou&#39;s tear in space ahead!</p>
<p>The party now sees it too!</p>
<p>But, another flashback stops us!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Laphi:</strong> &quot;<strong>Arthur, there&#39;s something I&#39;d like to speak to you about. Alone.</strong>&quot; Oh no...</p>
<p><strong>Laphi:</strong> &quot;&#39;<strong>Two souls possessing powerful resonance and free of malevolence. These must be sacrificed on the Scarlet Night.</strong>&#39;&quot;<br>
<strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;Ah, yes, the ceremony to resurrect Innominat. You read my book?&quot;</p>
<p>So Laphi was making his copy through reading the Shepherd&#39;s annotated script...</p>
<p><strong>Laphi:</strong> &quot;You wrote that if Innominat is resurrected, we can make a world free of daemons.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;Seven years ago, a soul with strong resonance...my own unborn son...was sacrificed for that purpose. Now Innominat&#39;s resurrection is half-complete.&quot; Oh my god...</p>
<p>Laphi points out thanks to Phi&#39;s sacrifice, everyone can see daemons.</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s the truth behind the Opening.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Laphi:</strong> &quot;So, if one more person is sacrificed...&quot; <strong>No...</strong>so he was the second sacrifice?</p>
<p>Laphi then asks the Shepherd...</p>
<p>The Shepherd looks away at this point.</p>
<p>....if <strong>he</strong> could be the sacrifice...oh my god...</p>
<p>I remember writing in the beginning of this game: <strong>Was Laphicet aware that he was going to be sacrificed?</strong> Yes, he was. Velvet reacts.</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;<strong>Tell me, why do you think that birds fly?</strong>&quot;<br>
<strong>Laphi:</strong> &quot;<strong>I think that birds fly because they must. Why else would they have wings if not to embrace the sky?</strong>&quot; His answer is one of &#39;reason.&#39;</p>
<p><strong>Laphi:</strong> &quot;I have wings too, weak as they are. <strong>That&#39;s why I must fly now!</strong>&quot; Oh my god....</p>
<p>Now this was the real twist.</p>
<p>Laphi does have the 12 Year Sickness. Hence why he says he won&#39;t be alive when the next Scarlet Night comes... <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>So by this time, I&#39;m guessing we might finish the game when the next Scarlet Night arrives.</p>
<p>Even the Shepherd&#39;s a bit in shock at what Laphi&#39;s saying.</p>
<p>Laphi confirms that he has the 12 Year Sickness.</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> (closes his eyes) &quot;...So you know.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Laphi:</strong> &quot;...I&#39;m not afraid of being sick. But I don&#39;t want to be just a burden to everyone till I die...&quot; no...</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;<strong>Your wings are your will.</strong> And they are strong.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet thinks they&#39;re lying.</p>
<p>Laphi tells him not to tell Velvet. Oh god...</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;<strong>I promise.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Laphi:</strong> &quot;<strong>I&#39;ll make a new world. A world where my sister can be happy.</strong>&quot; Except she&#39;s not!</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Velvet claws at the flashback!</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Don&#39;t talk to me about will! About wings! Both of you...Together, you...<strong><em>YOU BETRAYED ME!</em></strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Now more flashbacks pop out...</p>
<p>Velvet tries to stop it.</p>
<p>Memories from three years ago, memories from Aball, memories from the Throne...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong><em>It&#39;s a lie! A dirty lie! All of it! It&#39;s all their lies! And I believed it!</em></strong>&quot; </p>
<p>She keeps smashing every single memory away... <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>The monster drops down!</p>
<p>Now we fight the Chimera!</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;What is this thing?&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;An amalgamation of multiple daemons?!&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>It doesn&#39;t matter what it is!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Reading from the guide, the best strategy is to attack it from the front! Attacking from the sides and back make it worse!</p>
<p>Now it unleashes its Wild Barrage, poking its mantis arms on the ground!</p>
<p>Eventually we take down the Chimera!</p>
<p>Velvet claws at the Chimera, who happens to be...Velvet!</p>
<p>Phi goes to her.</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;Calm down, Velvet! This farce is just another one of Innominat&#39;s illusions!&quot;</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Then Innominat himself comes to the fray!</p>
<p><strong>Innominat:</strong> &quot;How callous. <strong>That &#39;farce&#39; is the true face of my sister. She hates, resents, devours, and kills. She tramples people, cities, everything, living only by her emotions...</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s not like that!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Innominat:</strong> &quot;She knows. She knows if it&#39;s the truth.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet falls...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Just think. Everything that I did was baseless, arrogant...And even so, I still...&quot;</p>
<p>Innominat lays the truth on for her.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;I devoured and killed so many...&quot;<br>
<strong>Innominat:</strong> &quot;Without even knowing Arthur&#39;s true aims...and worse yet, you didn&#39;t even show true mercy to your own sister&#39;s reincarnation.&quot;</p>
<p>Lies! Seres asked her to eat her...</p>
<p><strong>Innominat:</strong> &quot;I still love you, Velvet. That&#39;s why I chose to become a sacrifice. For you, sister.&quot;</p>
<p>He&#39;s manipulating her too well here...</p>
<p>Innominat reveals his initial fear of dying.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;I&#39;m sorry...I&#39;m so sorry...&quot;</p>
<p>Innominat asks her if she accepts all of her crimes. <strong>She does. Oh my god.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>I hurt so many people, all for no reason.</strong> <strong><em>I am a monster.</em></strong>&quot; She tears up.</p>
<p>Innominat tells her to atone. He rises up.</p>
<p><strong>Innominat:</strong> &quot;Once I eat the two malevolences inside you, I&#39;ll fully awaken. Give them to me. Give me your hatred, your despair.&quot;</p>
<p>He starts preparing his long-awaited meal of malevolence.</p>
<p><strong>Innominat:</strong> &quot;If you do, I can cleanse this world of all its pain.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s getting sucked in...</p>
<p>Phi tries to stop her from getting inside Innominat&#39;s mouth...he grabs her daemon arm...</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s getting pulled in, but Rokurou pulls her from the vortex...</p>
<p>The other Chimera!Velvet is sucked into the disembodied mouth of Innominat...</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Let me go...I have to go...&quot;<br>
<strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;No!&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;If you don&#39;t, you&#39;ll die too for no reason...&quot;</p>
<p>Innominat also plans to eat Phi too...</p>
<p>Eizen pulls Phi&#39;s leg and tells him to tell Velvet &quot;what she needs to hear!&quot; He uses his arte to chain himself to the earth...</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;<strong><em>Will you STOP WHINING!?</em></strong> No, I don&#39;t &quot;understand&quot;! You snap at people! You&#39;re scary! [...] But...you&#39;re also kind...and you&#39;re filled with life! <strong>I don&#39;t understand a single thing about you!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>And it&#39;s these moments are <strong>why</strong> I am a <em>Tales</em> fan... :&#39;)</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;<strong>But you gave me a name, when I was a number! You gave me that compass! You taught me what it meant to be alive! That&#39;s why I care about you, Velvet! I&#39;ll protect you for my own sake! I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re malevolent! Or if it was pointless! If the world says if it was a mistake to love you, I&#39;ll fight the whole world! I don&#39;t care how much pain you feel! It doesn&#39;t matter! A world without you, Velvet...</strong> <strong><em>is the one thing I couldn&#39;t bear!</em></strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Her arm opens up now...biting Phi&#39;s right arm!</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;I don&#39;t care...Just...leave me the other one! I need it <strong><em>to clobber the jerk who made my Velvet cry!</em></strong>&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>I loved them all...I loved Laphi, Celica, Arthur, everyone...To have it all stolen from me...Why them? Why not me?</strong> <strong><em>It hurt so much!</em></strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Innominat&#39;s in shock at her despair vanishing...</p>
<p>The warp appears...</p>
<p>And Seres, or Celica, comes forth!</p>
<p><strong>Seres:</strong> &quot;<strong>A flame burns in my heart, too. A flame I cannot quench, no matter how hard I try. Just like you, Velvet.</strong>&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;I finally understand how you felt.&quot; Yes, Seres, or Celica, loved them.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;But the only one I can fight for...<strong>is myself.</strong>&quot;<br>
<strong>Seres:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s good enough. <strong>That&#39;s proof that you are truly alive.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Her arm takes Seres&#39;s flame...</p>
<p>She charges at the rift...using her fiery arm at it and burning Innominat!</p>

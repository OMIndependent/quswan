<p>We save before meeting up with Dyle at the Hollow entrance.</p>
<p>Velvet asks if his &quot;special concoction&quot; is ready.</p>
<p>Dyle says it&#39;s ready. He asks Velvet for her name. She says it.</p>
<p><strong>Dyle:</strong> &quot;We&#39;ll sail together if we live, Velvet. If not, well, at least, I know what to put on your tombstone.&quot; Heh...</p>
<p>Outside, another <strong>skit</strong> occurs where Rokurou asks Velvet about the malak child who took the compass. I also forgot that he left to get weapons before Teresa came in with her malakhim.</p>
<p>This means they might run into him in the city while their plan happens.</p>
<p>It sounds like Rokurou has some qualms about killing malakhim children. Velvet...doesn&#39;t care. Rokurou says he&#39;ll thank him for healing them before taking care of him...</p>
<p>A ring appears in front of Velvet&#39;s pic during the skit, while she says &quot;that malakhim don&#39;t taste very good...&quot; She&#39;s thinking about Seres, isn&#39;t she?</p>
<p>We head at the front gate.</p>
<p>The battle begins!</p>
<p>We go inside. The city&#39;s empty.</p>
<p>Velvet knew it! </p>

<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>There&#39;s the &quot;Frozen Queen&quot; (and Magilou) waiting for us at the doors of the sanctuary, along with a circle of orderlies...</p>
<p>We casually walk over to them.</p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s smiling. He knows what&#39;s coming. Velvet&#39;s not in the mood for games, though...</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Well, look who showed up to rescue me! Awww, you&#39;re more of a softie than I ever gave you credit for...&quot;</p>
<p>At least she knew you were tricking us...</p>
<p>Now Teresa, brandishing her holy scepter, wants revenge for Oscar&#39;s injury!</p>
<p>We meet a new kind of orderly for this fight.</p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s &quot;honor bound&quot; to help Velvet.</p>
<p>As sson as we defeat them, more orderlies come forth!</p>
<p>I check Velvet&#39;s new arte: the <strong>Mega Sonic Thrust</strong>, which can break through armor and push enemies down...</p>
<p>More exorcist orderlies come, and Teresa orders the entire fleet to attack! Just as Velvet planned.</p>
<p>I keep getting hit a lot here...</p>
<p>Now Teresa enters the circle.</p>
<p><strong>Teresa:</strong> &quot;I admire your endurance, but you will regret this soon enough.&quot; </p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Teresa calls one of her malakhim to attack Velvet...who throws a fireball at her...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> (to Teresa) &quot;You can&#39;t finish your own work? Coward.&quot; <strong>Ohhhhh!</strong></p>
<p>But Teresa&#39;s not buying her taunt, saying condescending things to Velvet, mentioning Velvet&#39;s daemonic status, for instance, as to why she&#39;s not going to face her herself.</p>
<p>Wow, Teresa also backhandedly insults one of her malakhim by calling him a &quot;tool&quot;...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Well, I&#39;ve got tools of my own. Tools of flamestone, sulfur, and oil.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Malak child:</strong> &quot;Those will...explode.&quot;</p>
<p>But before Teresa could respond, an explosion occurs! Our chance!</p>
<p>Velvet knocks her out with a kick!</p>
<p>Magilou&#39;s not happy that she&#39;s being left behind! Oh, Magilou...</p>
<p>The guild members now come to Teresa in distress, saying that the port&#39;s ablaze...</p>
<p>We get our XP.</p>
<p>Dyle tells the party the ship&#39;s ready...and he gets fireballed out! Oh god... <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Teresa and her malakhim come to stop us!</p>
<p>I check on Teresa and her malakhim&#39;s stats: she has a wide range of artes at her disposal...I am so unprepared for this fight.</p>
<p>I decide to take care of the first malak before going after the second and then Teresa.</p>
<p>But, my plans change as I decide to stop any of the malakhim who prepare to cast their spells first...</p>
<p>Velvet and Teresa do a little chase around the docks...</p>
<p>With Velvet, I take care of the first malak while Rokurou takes care of the second...</p>
<p>Our focus stats are down so far. </p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Teresa can create a barrier to protect herself from our attacks, huh?</p>
<p>Teresa&#39;s strong against water based artes and attacks. Luckily, we don&#39;t have those...</p>
<p>Velvet gets KO&#39;d!</p>
<p>I switch to Rokurou and revive her, and we finish Teresa!</p>
<p><strong>Teresa:</strong> &quot;As Exorcist Preator Teresa, I give you this order!&quot;</p>
<p>She calls on her second malak to self-destruct!</p>
<p>Velvet knocks him out, and finishes Teresa...</p>
<p>...but Eleanor blocks the final blow!</p>
<p>Now Velvet grabs the child malak, threatening to <strong>eat</strong> him if he doesn&#39;t follow her order to push the praetors back! My god... <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>He does so. They run away! Velvet takes the child malak with her!</p>
<p>They&#39;re gone...</p>
<p>The townspeople are now frightened, one of them declaring Hellawes is &quot;finished.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Teresa:</strong> &quot;Curse you...curse you...&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;...The Abbey--no, Lord Artorius himself must be informed.&quot;</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We did it!</p>
<p>We get our rewards, and the game tells me about &quot;power links&quot;...</p>
<p>Dyle&#39;s still alive, thank goodness! He&#39;s taking the helm, smiling.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Well, that turned out better than I expected. Though, we wound up with a little extra.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet wonders why he would say that. She&#39;s in shock that she grabbed the malak child into the ship.</p>
<p>Magilou thinks he&#39;d be a good snack for Velvet. Rokurou says to him she&#39;s joking.</p>
<p>The malak&#39;s still thinking in terms of orders.</p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s not sure to take the malak along. But Velvet thinks of using him for now.</p>
<p>Magilou agrees, dehumanizing the malak by calling people like him &quot;tools.&quot; The malak child says &quot;yes&quot; to her statement.</p>
<p>Velvet glowers, looking away.</p>

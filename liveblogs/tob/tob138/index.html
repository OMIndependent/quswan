<p>Another <strong>skit:</strong> Eleanor points out Mt. Killaraus hasn&#39;t erupted at all. Rokurou wonders if he lied about that. Magilou points out, knowing him, he can tell half-truths.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;<strong>With the four Empyreans revived, the land has awakened. Changes in the earth that once took eons will now happen in a few 100 years.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Mt. Killaraus&#39; eruption has probably been hastened by centuries. Lucky it hasn&#39;t happened yet.</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;[100 years is a] long while to a human, but compared to the history of the land, it&#39;ll be a blink of an eye.&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou warns about Innominat and what he will do once he&#39;s finished, though.</p>
<p>Poor Velvet...</p>
<p>And Magilou brushes that worry off. Eleanor disagrees.</p>
<p>A third <strong>skit: Avenging Aifread.</strong></p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s aware of the strength Melchior had. Velvet owes Magilou for distracting Melchior. Eizen points that out.</p>
<p>Velvet asks Eizen if he wanted to finish him.</p>
<p>Eizen&#39;s not concerned, but I&#39;m thinking he&#39;s a bit disappointed.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;If Melchior had only manipulated Aifread for personal reasons, then that would be settled now. <strong>But he was acting based on his idea of &#39;reason,&#39; that creating a world without malevolence was worth the cost of</strong> [...] <strong>people&#39;s free will. Aifread won&#39;t be avenged until I destroy that very philosophy.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>So Eizen has his plans too. He&#39;s staying till the very end. Not until the Shepherd and Innominat are gone can his revenge be fulfilled.</p>
<p>Velvet and Eizen make a challenge to each other to be the ones to take care of the remaining Abbey members. Laphicet&#39;s in too.</p>
<p>I save before opening the next skit.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Skit:</strong> Magilou asks Velvet about the feeling of taking out the souls from inside her.</p>
<p>Velvet and Eleanor are grossed out by her question.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Why so cranky? I was only asking to see if you were getting hungry or not.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh, Magilou...</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s hungry but it wasn&#39;t the souls. She thinks it&#39;s thanks to Innominat losing power that she&#39;s gaining her appetite.</p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s hungry too. And so does everyone else!</p>
<p>Magilou denies being hungry. Eizen decides she&#39;s on watch during dinner.</p>
<p>Eleanor and Velvet decide to make food once they get back...</p>
<p>Bienfu and Laphicet are excited about their courses.</p>
<p>Magilou is definitely hungry. She wants &quot;Calegian-style borscht!&quot; Hee.</p>
<p>Velvet then tells her to get peaches. For the pie.</p>
<p>Another <strong>skit: Brawny Bienfu?</strong></p>
<p>This skit is just progress on our geotree-searching. Poor Bienfu...</p>
<p>Laphicet apologizes, but Bienfu doesn&#39;t mind, as he&#39;s getting stronger!</p>
<p>Eleanor apologizes for putting Bienfu through the geoboard business, but she thanks him.</p>
<p>And it goes downhill from here...in Bienfu&#39;s case...Eleanor will massage him...with her spear!</p>
<p>Bienfu reconsiders, but she massages him anyway...</p>
<p>Now where to next?</p>

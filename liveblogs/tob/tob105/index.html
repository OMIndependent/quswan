<p>I check out the <strong>Apodous Quarter</strong> first before going back to Titania.</p>
<p>I also decide to face the daemons in the Apodous Quarter this time.</p>
<p>After a long, winding battle, we win a pair of <strong>Military Hike</strong> boots!</p>
<p>Now off to Titania!</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s brooding on the side of the ship. She looks at her arm...oh my god...</p>
<p>Phi goes to her with the tome and asks Velvet about Laphi copying said tome by hand. He praises Laphi for being able to know Meliodasian.</p>
<p>Velvet pouts, then gapes in shock!</p>
<p>It&#39;s Laphi again she sees, not Phi...</p>
<p>Velvet pulls out the comb, and tells him about her brother.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Laphi was different from [others]. He read books a lot because [of his condition]. He studied all the time so that he could be ready to travel the world one day. Which was kind of funny, considering he&#39;d hide in my bed whenever he had a nightmare.&quot; Velvet, quit teasing Laphi...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;But... I don&#39;t care that he got scared... I just wanted him to live...That&#39;s why I...I have to...&quot; Oh god, she&#39;s almost passing out...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;I&#39;ll devour as much as it takes... I will have vengeance... &quot;</p>
<p>She falls.</p>
<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> Speaking of which, I found it interesting that <em>The Wrath of Khan</em> was originally going to be called <em>The Vengeance of Khan</em> because the producers didn&#39;t want to get their movie confused with <em>Revenge of the Jedi</em>. Then, <em>Revenge of the Jedi</em> was retitled as <em>Return of the Jedi</em>...</p>

<hr>
<p>Meanwhile back at the Empyrean&#39;s Throne, Shigure, Melchior, and the Shepherd meet with Oscar.</p>
<p>What is the Shepherd doing to Oscar? He casts an arte on him...but what kind of arte...?</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;Done. The arte is attuned to you.&quot;</p>
<p>Oscar assures his master he will not fail. Shigure strokes his chin and compliments him for taking on the arte.</p>
<p>Oscar tells him politely to shove it.</p>
<p>Teresa comes in with dire news. Melchior tells her to leave. Teresa asks the Shepherd about the arte he cast on Oscar. He confirms he did it.</p>
<p>Teresa&#39;s in shock.</p>
<p>And like other experiments, there&#39;s a risk...</p>
<p>Teresa mentions a therion. Oh boy...</p>
<p>Teresa, looking at her brother in shock, wants to take part in the experiment herself! What!?</p>
<p>The Shepherd tells her she&#39;s &quot;not strong enough...&quot;</p>
<p>Teresa still wants to help. Shigure thinks she has other intentions. She really loves her brother very much...</p>
<p><strong>Shigure:</strong> &quot;Noble plan, but I&#39;m afraid it&#39;d mess everything up.&quot; What is he talking about?</p>
<p>The Shepherd glares daggers at Shigure! Shigure waves it off.</p>
<p>Oscar tells Teresa he consented to the experiment. This is his way of making up for his two failures at Titania and Palamides.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Teresa wants to go with Oscar, but the Shepherd has other plans...</p>
<p>The Shepherd officially strips Teresa of her title as exorcist and tells her to give up her only malak.</p>
<p><strong>Melchior:</strong> &quot;For our plans to be realized, we require an especially strong malak.&quot; Oh no, are they going to sacrifice him?</p>
<p><strong>Melchior:</strong> &quot;We&#39;ve analyzed your malak&#39;s dormant abilities and he is of considerable power—on the same level as the young malak who betrayed us for the enemy.&quot; So the first malak child is going to be used again to counter Phi.</p>
<p>Shigure condescends Teresa with his buttery words. Shut up, Shigure.</p>
<p>The Shepherd now casts another arte, surrounding himself in a golden aura...</p>
<p>The crest of Innominat lights up...oh god....</p>
<p>The Shepherd renounces Teresa&#39;s only malak, and is taken to Melchior.</p>
<p>She cries...so she does care for the malak...</p>
<p>So Teresa knows how to make a quiche. I&#39;m betting she&#39;s using Velvet&#39;s recipe...</p>
<p>Teresa is not having it.</p>
<p>The Shepherd tells Oscar if he succeeds in getting Velvet, Teresa gets back her title as exorcist.</p>
<p><strong>Oscar:</strong> (to Teresa) &quot;Don&#39;t worry about me. I&#39;d go to the ends of the earth and back for a plate of your delicious quiche.&quot;</p>
<p>He smiles and salutes her, taking his leave.</p>
<p><strong>Teresa:</strong> &quot;No, Oscar, don&#39;t go...<strong>Oscaaaar!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Now Teresa&#39;s alone...</p>
<p>The crest of Innominat shines again.</p>
<p>Now Teresa notices something.</p>
<p><strong>Teresa:</strong> &quot;I&#39;m...<strong>receptive...?</strong> To that arte...? And to you...&quot; Oh no, it seems Innominat is talking to her through her thoughts...</p>
<p>She smiles.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Velvet&#39;s up.</p>
<p>She&#39;s been unconscious for three days, Phi tells her. Three days? I wonder why writers go to the number three instead of two?</p>
<p>She asks for an update.</p>
<p>Grim&#39;s finished translating the tome, and tells us we have a complete copy of the tome!</p>
<p>Kamoana loves Orthie and Russ...</p>
<p>Phi tells her to &quot;take it easy.&quot; He&#39;s blushing.</p>
<p>Velvet worriedly asks if he ate anything. He hasn&#39;t, and she tells him to eat something.</p>
<p>Magilou comes in and explains.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Malakhim don&#39;t actually depend on food for sustenance. If they do eat, it&#39;s only as a quirky hobby.&quot; I did get spoiled about that fact from <em>Zestiria.</em></p>
<p>Rokurou tells Velvet they&#39;re back in Titania.</p>
<p>Velvet tells the crew to assemble. <em>De facto</em>, she&#39;s the captain leading the crew...</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> (sighs) &quot;Well, that could have gotten better.&quot;<br>
<strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;I just...wanted to understand the hardships Velvet&#39;s suffering through. It seems unfair for her to bear all of it alone.&quot; I know, Phi... <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Rokurou describes her as, in his own way, &quot;a very straightforward person.&quot; At least she doesn&#39;t lie most of the time.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;But nothing gets under her skin like a clumsy display of sympathy.&quot; That quality is what makes her different from the Shepherd.</p>
<p>Rokurou tells Phi to eat up.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;For now just get something in your tummy. Any good warrior knows: you eat when you have the chance.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;<strong>But what is there to fill an empty heart</strong>, I wonder?&quot;</p>
<p>Now I&#39;m in control of Rokurou.</p>
<p>I play a <strong>skit</strong> where Rokurou asks Phi what he wants to eat. Magilou jumps in and says she wants seafood. He ignores her.</p>
<p>Rokurou suggests a risotto or vegetable rice soup...mmmm...</p>
<p>Phi says okay.</p>
<p>Magilou lists out her menu. Dessert included.</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;I&#39;d think I like rice porridge. With a pickled plum and baby sardines on top....and an apple.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet comes in, saying &quot;appleboo&quot; again. More appleboos...or grated apples...I need to try making appleboos...</p>
<p>Phi decides on that.</p>
<p>Magilou also wants something. Rokurou tells her to be quiet.</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Other pirates are talking about the absence of Abbey navy presence around Titania. The Bloodwings also mention the Abbey&#39;s &quot;quiet everywhere.&quot; They&#39;re planning their next move...</p>
<p>Looks like we&#39;ve been giving them trouble so far that theyre now thinking hard on their next move...</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s Aifread&#39;s pirates for ya!&quot;</p>
<p>The pirates mock the Shepherd.</p>
<p><strong>Pirate:</strong> &quot;Reason dictates that we avoid hopeless fights.&quot;<br>
<strong>Other pirate:</strong> &quot;Oooh, Shepherd Artorius, you&#39;re my hero!&quot;</p>
<p>But the pirates know they have to stay one step ahead of the Abbey. That&#39;s true.</p>
<p>One of the pirates admires the exorcists for fighting formidable daemons, though.</p>
<p>I save before proceeding.</p>
<p>Kamoana&#39;s a bit frightened. Benwick tells Velvet not to push herself too much.</p>
<p>Inside, we get our next earthpulse point. According to Phi, &quot;it&#39;s really really far up in the northeast.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor mentions the place as <strong>Endgand</strong>. Oh boy...</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Endgand is a collection of small islands. There&#39;s [...] <strong>Lionel Island</strong>, but that&#39;s the exception.&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou points out Endgand&#39;s haunted...you troll, quit scaring Phi!</p>
<p>Eizen debunks that by mentioning that all currents &quot;converge in Endgand&#39;s waters,&quot; meaning all shipwrecks end up there.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;So that&#39;s where the stories of ghost ships come from.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Boo. You guys have no imagination.&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;I&#39;d rather they&#39;d stay imaginary myself.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s not letting legends or ghost stories stop the crew.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Ghost ship, exorcist, whatever comes along...We&#39;ll be the ones to administer their last rites.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Skit:</strong> Velvet&#39;s pondering on Seres&#39;s final words about the Shepherd.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;That means she must have known everything...that Innominat is incomplete, how therions work...but <strong>why did she betray [the Shepherd]? Why did she give me her strength?</strong>&quot; These are some of the same questions I have. Why betray your old master? Unless he must have done something that Seres didn&#39;t agree with...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Tell me.. why did you do it, Sis—Oh what am I saying?&quot; Whoa, wait a minute! She&#39;s thinking of her sister Celica again...her headaches are getting worse...she tells herself to focus.</p>
<p>After leaving Aball, she hasn&#39;t been the same...</p>
<p><a name=6></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Phi&#39;s pretty full from his meal. So is Rokurou.</p>
<p>Eizen tells us about Endgand&#39;s currents.</p>
<p>Bienfu points out Velvet&#39;s looking pallid...</p>
<p>Magilou mentions something about the &quot;Phantom Fleet [carrying] guilty souls away.&quot; Is Velvet feeling guilty for what she did back at Aball?</p>
<p>A pirate tells us Prince Percival&#39;s enjoying Orthie and Russ&#39;s company. He&#39;s also doing some work too. Eleanor&#39;s worried about this...thinking it&#39;s a bit much, but the Prince insists.</p>
<p>Plus, the Prince &quot;couldn&#39;t even yawn without getting permission&quot;? Oh my god...</p>
<p>Yikes, the Prince also wasn&#39;t able to play with his pets too...</p>
<p>The pirate mentions &quot;he&#39;s too good to be a prince,&quot; and adds that a prince &quot;who gets the common folk&quot; is a better leader.</p>
<p>I head further in the hideout and see Orthie and Russ sitting on top of crates...the dogs still look angry...</p>
<p>A pirate downstairs declares by order of the No. 1 (Eizen), that the sleeping quarters around here are Kamoana and Medissa&#39;s quarters, and that people who defy that declaration &quot;will be executed.&quot;</p>
<p>We head to the south docks where a pirate asks Eizen about the four wonders: the <strong>Phantom Fleet</strong>, <strong>Dragon Island</strong>, the <strong>Bighedian Tribe</strong>, and the <strong>Kraken Queen</strong>.</p>
<p>So the pirates here are having a debate on what actually are the four wonders.</p>
<p>The fourth wonder, according to the other pirate, is the <strong>Colossal Upright Eel</strong>.</p>
<p>Phi asks about the Kraken Queen. In short, it&#39;s a giant black squid that grapples onto people and makes them &quot;happy,&quot; for some reason.</p>
<p>Eleanor tells the &quot;bad pirate&quot; to be quiet.</p>
<p>Eleanor and Magilou now fight for the decency of Phi, with Magilou explaining about the Kraken Queen...Eizen jumps in.</p>
<p>Poor Phi...Teresa hurt him too... <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Eleanor declares the fourth wonder is the eel!</p>
<p>I&#39;m getting a bit hungry when the pirate describes the eel...</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s a fish...with legs...?&quot;</p>
<p><a name=7></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We go to Dyle...he&#39;s hiding because of Kamoana...she wants his tail. Dyle says he needs his tail in case he needs a quick getaway...</p>
<p>Medissa and Kamoana argue.</p>
<p>Another <strong>skit</strong> plays and Kamoana doesn&#39;t want to dry her hair...</p>
<p>And I see Medissa&#39;s skit portrait for the first time. Her hair does look snakelike...</p>
<p>Kamoana boldly states that she won&#39;t catch a cold...</p>
<p>Eleanor says that her hair&#39;s dry enough already, and Kamoana runs off.</p>
<p>Medissa knows what Eleanor did to Kamoana&#39;s actual mother from Phi. Magilou calls Phi a &quot;tattletale.&quot; Medissa considers what happened to Kamoana &quot;too tragic for words.&quot; True.</p>
<p>Eleanor doesn&#39;t have the heart to tell Kamoana the truth. Medissa agrees, but asks if she&#39;s going to actually &quot;lie to [Kamoana] forever&quot; about what happened to her mother.</p>
<p><strong>Medissa:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s probably the only option. But do you really think you can lie to her forever?&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;I have to, for her sake.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet calls Kamoana &quot;selfish.&quot; Look at Velvet. Her quest is nothing but a selfish trip to avenge her brother.</p>
<p>And I nearly tune out of this skit, since I really don&#39;t agree with Medissa&#39;s message here next.</p>
<p>She asks Velvet if she has memories like Kamoana&#39;s. Velvet doesn&#39;t let them out.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> (shrugs) &quot;Everybody and their issues, amirite?&quot;</p>
<p>Medissa warns us the Abbey&#39;s now getting dangerous because we have seven therions with us.</p>
<p>Back to Kurogane. Phi asks what&#39;s wrong. Dyle&#39;s trying to run and hide from Kamoana, or rather, he&#39;s playing hide and seek with her.</p>
<p>Kamoana&#39;s hiding inside Kurogane!</p>
<p>Phi&#39;s surprised!</p>
<p>Kamoana begged Kurogane to hide inside him! Phi and Kamoana thank him...Kurogane&#39;s upper torso blushes...hee...</p>
<p>Kamoana now thinks of Kurogane&#39;s armor as &quot;her secret hideout.&quot; If only Al were in this game...</p>
<p>Benwick&#39;s getting used to the hideout...</p>
<p>I set sail to Port Cadnix knowing I forgot to do a sidequest there.</p>

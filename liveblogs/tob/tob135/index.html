<p>Now time to hotfoot it in this volcano!</p>
<p>I face new monsters like the <strong>Igniter Moles</strong>, <strong>Lava Atlases</strong>, and <strong>Lizard Paladins</strong> here!</p>
<p>I&#39;m getting better at using Rokurou&#39;s Vengeful Soul Burst artes...it must be because the Lizard Paladins attacks are easy to telegraph...</p>
<p>I switch Velvet with Eizen this time...</p>
<p>After a few more battles, I see a huge rock giant walking around with clouds of thick malevolence, this must be another code red daemon...</p>
<p>I walk to a small narrow end where a Katz Box is! Rescuing the Katz gives us <strong>Bushy Eyebrows!</strong></p>
<p>Now for the code red...</p>
<p>But after a battle, I change my mind and cross a narrow crossing, where Velvet restates our goal: to get Melchior&#39;s soul to wake the Empyreans up.</p>
<p>Laphicet asks if she&#39;s okay.</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s small smile when she mentions eating Melchior makes it look like she&#39;s a bona-fide villain. In another story, she might be...</p>
<p>Laphicet brings up what happened to her after she consumed Teresa and Oscar in Baird Marsh...</p>
<p>She tells him that she hasn&#39;t collapsed after taking Shigure&#39;s soul.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;...Look at me. I&#39;m fine, right? Does it seem like I&#39;m faking it?&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet thinks she&#39;s now used to consuming powerful souls after Oscar and Teresa...</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;You&#39;re not just used to it. You&#39;ve changed.&quot; Yes, she has. She didn&#39;t care about being labeled &quot;Lord of Calamity,&quot; and now here she is embracing that title...</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;Just as I changed after finding my free will, you&#39;ve gotten stronger through our travels too. You faced down many sorrows and hardships, and overcame them all.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Did I, though?&quot;<br>
<strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;You did! And that&#39;s why Iâ€”&quot;</p>
<p>Someone&#39;s stomach is growling...</p>
<p>Velvet might make Laphicet a quiche. Laphicet asks for pudding.</p>
<p>Velvet notices Laphicet&#39;s trying to make her feel better. Since malakhim don&#39;t need food, that&#39;s how she knows.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;All right, let&#39;s go and find me some Melchior to eat.&quot;</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I face off against the code red here: the <strong>Titan!</strong> He&#39;s weak against non elemental attacks, but strong against fire and earth attacks...</p>
<p>This code red has a high level of defense!</p>
<p>We manage to topple the daemon over, but he falls on top of Rokurou!</p>
<p>We now have the Titan&#39;s health down thanks to Magilou, Laphicet, and Eizen&#39;s artes!</p>
<p>Rokurou falls easily to the Titan!</p>
<p>But I revive him, and slowly finish off the Titan, and win a <strong>Juggernaut&#39;s Glacite!</strong></p>
<p>I climb a branch of red vines and find a heap of Katz spirits!</p>
<p>Magilou mentions one battle&#39;s victory as &quot;perfalmost...&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Maybe don&#39;t invent new words.&quot; Yes, please Magilou, don&#39;t do that!</p>
<p>Heading down into a long cavern, where I follow the trail of Katz spirits...</p>
<p>...and grab another Soul Bottle!</p>
<p>Two more areas to go before facing Melchior!</p>
<p>We&#39;re now deep in the cauldron caverns, which has more of an intense atmosphere than the caverns before we faced Shigure!</p>
<p>I switch Eizen for Eleanor this time in the battle roster...and accidentally make him the onscreen map character!</p>
<p>Eeee, the trail of Katz spirits go down into the lava!</p>
<p>Now I walk a long passage left of that area, and a right, leading down to another chest...</p>
<p>There&#39;s lots of flamestone pieces and ore around the small pockets of the cauldron cavern wall.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Going up an incline, Rokurou asks Magilou about Melchior...</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;To put it short, <strong>he&#39;s the exorcists&#39; shadow...they&#39;re supposed to be free of malevolence, but they&#39;re only human, and so are those who they want to save. But sincerity and conviction alone won&#39;t save the world. To remain free of malevolence, they need someone to do their dirty work. A shadow.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Even Eleanor herself didn&#39;t know of Melchior&#39;s plans, which is the role of &quot;the exorcists&#39;s shadow&quot;.</p>
<p>Rokurou wonders why he hasn&#39;t fallen to malevolence.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;<strong>Because his belief in the exorcists as the saviors of the world is pure and unyielding.</strong> It is a mountain of ice that will neither boil nor melt nor break.&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou&#39;s seen his &quot;frozen heart&quot; firsthand.</p>
<p>Laphicet realizes something: She might have been an experiment for Melchior! This explains the &quot;heart being broken many times&quot; line she said back in the Calix.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;<strong>Melchior was raising me to be the shadow for the next leader of the exorcists... [the Shepherd] himself.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>She goes back to her chipper demeanor, calling it a &quot;terrible mistake.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;So if things had gone as he planned, we&#39;d be fighting you instead of Melchior.&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s happy Magilou&#39;s on their side.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;If Magilou was running the Abbey...&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;They would be completely unpredictable [and] fearsome.&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou calls it &quot;a whole lot of fun.&quot; Ai ya...</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;So Melchior... was my shadow too.&quot;</p>
<p>Is Eleanor having second thoughts?</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;There&#39;s nothing to be sad about. Removing shadows is part of a shadow&#39;s job. Even if I&#39;m a failed shadow, I&#39;m still a witch, and I cast a deeper darkness!&quot;</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We make it outside, to the higher peaks of the volcano now!</p>
<p>Velvet points out where Melchior is again: at the peak of the mountain.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Be careful. [He&#39;s] nothing like Shigure. He won&#39;t fight us head-on.&quot;</p>
<p>I carefully head north, down the steep small land bridge down to where two treasures are...</p>
<p>One of them has <strong>Mythril Earrings!</strong></p>
<p>Once I get inside the upper cavern, I play another <strong>skit: Odds of Victory</strong>.</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s unsure whether the crew will win against Melchior. </p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;I&#39;d give us a four-to-one against. [...] Almost every trick I or any current exorcist knows can be traced back to him.&quot;</p>
<p>He definitely is the mind of the Abbey.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;If I throw three artes at once, he&#39;ll pull six out of his hat. He knows our capabilites and he&#39;s got far more power.&quot; </p>
<p>But she counts on the other members of the crew: Velvet, Rokurou, and Laphicet to be the unpredictable factors.</p>
<p>She thinks things might go in their favor if they pull something that Melchior won&#39;t expect.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;<strong>We are challenging the hardest possible foe.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>I get more nervous fighting Melchior than I am Shigure now thanks to that line...</p>
<p>Magilou reminds Eleanor again that Melchior&#39;s a smart, tricky one.</p>
<p>Eizen steps in, agreeing with Magilou.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;After all [...] forewarned is forearmed, right?&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou thinks he has no weaknesses whatsoever. Eizen thinks &quot;looking at their feet&quot; might be the best idea...</p>
<p>I continue crossing the upper caverns of the volcano...</p>
<p>There&#39;s a gap we can cross via geoboard that leads to another area...</p>
<p>Since the geotree&#39;s in this area as well...</p>
<p>I pick up a <strong>Mythril Talisman</strong> along the way.</p>
<p>I head south and east to a small dead end, and touch the geotree! Now I can use the geoboard for Mt. Killaraus!</p>
<p>We use the geoboard to leap across the vast gap, and make it to the second area of this cavern...</p>
<p>I collect another <strong>Elixir</strong> here!</p>
<p>Now I geoboard before the south exit of the cavern and find a save point here!</p>

<p>Now there&#39;s one question on my mind: <strong>Will Eleanor carry out her mission to bring Laphicet back to the Shepherd, or will she continue with the crew?</strong></p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s interested in the sights now! Eleanor goes with him...oh, dear...Velvet tells them not to get lost...</p>
<p>One Bloodwing disguised as a soldier shows the flaws of not enhancing weapons.</p>
<p>Some more news from a local: the <strong>Aldina Plains</strong> road is about to be opened!</p>
<p>From one local, the Shepherd&#39;s rise has dropped daemon attacks drastically...</p>
<p>Magilou reminds the local that the daemons who were responsible for what happened at Hellawes are still wanted! Plus, the incident at Southgand...what a bubble burster Magilou is! She was also about to tell more stories about a &quot;daemon doll.&quot;</p>
<p>Rumors are also spreading about Eleanor turning from the Abbey.</p>
<p>We also find Nobumichi, the second son, another Character Cards player! I have six rounds with him!</p>
<p>In the west of the city, there&#39;s a show going on! Majelu&#39;s Troupe is performing!</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s in awe. She seems to know Majelu, but Magilou steps in and thinks they&#39;re talking about her!</p>
<p>So Majelu is short for &quot;The Majestic Lulu,&quot; a dancer.</p>
<p>Everyone&#39;s impressed by Majelu. Magilou&#39;s getting jealous by the second...</p>
<p>Magilou calls Majelu a &quot;con artist.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Majelu:</strong> &quot;I can&#39;t just ignore that, you know.&quot; Oh dear...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>No, she&#39;s hearing the crowd praise and cheer for her.</p>
<p>Eleanor explains about her world famous instructor Valta, who had to pass on his skills to Majelu.</p>
<p>Now Majelu faces off against Magilou. Dance battle!</p>
<p>The bald Valta comes to her and reprimands her for picking a &quot;petty fight.&quot; His pain resurges. </p>
<p>He&#39;s smart, only a dance battle can solve that dispute. He&#39;s hard on Majelu because he has high expectations for her...</p>
<p>Eleanor knows trivia about them because she&#39;s a fan. She blushes when she says this.</p>
<p>Magilou calls Majelu and Valta&#39;s tale &quot;a sweet little story&quot; and decides to start a show: a comedy act! Since the crew doesn&#39;t know how to dance, they start making the audience laugh instead.</p>
<p>Velvet considers this whole scene a waste of time.</p>
<p>But, if they capture the audience&#39;s laughter, they&#39;ll get more money!</p>
<p>Rokurou plays along. He doesn&#39;t know what&#39;s happening, but at least he&#39;s a good sport about it. That&#39;s one of the reasons why I like him.</p>
<p>Magilou assigns Velvet &quot;the straight man&quot; act. Eizen agrees, since they might need the money.</p>
<p>Magilou figures out what role to assign to everyone next. Even Eizen...</p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s &quot;not so sure about&quot; the whole idea...</p>
<p><strong>Expedition check:</strong> We get a new treasure: the <strong>Replica Key of Lorelei</strong>, a sword!</p>
<p>Rokurou questions if that sword&#39;s even a key, he thinks the person who owned this &quot;must have been a giant...three stories tall.&quot; Eleanor&#39;s curious on what the key unlocks, a &quot;lost sound...&quot;</p>
<p>Even Rokurou and Eleanor are a bit puzzled by the Key of Lorelei...</p>
<p>Rokurou concludes the Key might be a &quot;key to a pair of...doors the size of sea gates, behind which a giant has locked away an extraordinary and mysterious musical instrument.&quot; Nuns.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Magilou reminds a woman of someone named <strong>Magillanica.</strong></p>
<p>The woman mentioned that <strong>Magillanica</strong> had &quot;mysterious powers.&quot;</p>
<p>She was labeled &quot;the Little Witch&quot; to her audience, and profitted. But, she got imprisoned for heresy... <img class=emojione alt=â˜¹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Velvet asks for Magilou&#39;s age...Magilou reacts in a way where Velvet rules out that she might be younger or around her age...</p>
<p>A peddler mentions Eastgand and northeast Midgand shifting...and I learn the Isles of Lakehaven used to be a mountain range. Hmmm...but they&#39;re surrounded in an area called the Thunder Isles.</p>
<p>In the inn, a patron&#39;s complaining that he left his key in his room. This inn has automatic locks...</p>
<p>An elderly man and a woman complain about the cold and lack of flamestone...but they have to &quot;endure.&quot; They now quote <del>Spock&#39;s</del> the Shepherd&#39;s teachings. The woman thinks he doesn&#39;t care about the people...she&#39;s getting somewhere...</p>
<p>Velvet rubs it in their faces that he only wants to &quot;save humanity as a whole,&quot; not a few individuals. Eleanor apologizes for her.</p>
<p>The girl in the fountain&#39;s decided to endure the hardships of food rationing...</p>
<p>My god, everyone&#39;s so devoted to the Shepherd!</p>
<p>A maid&#39;s thinking of starting up a band...</p>
<p>A housewife&#39;s hearing true stories about the High Priest. Magilou tries to confirm, but gets shushed by Eleanor. But the description of the daemon who did the break-in is very inaccurate...</p>
<p>And the rumors get more exaggerated. And Magilou tries to point out the daemons in front of them! Oh my god, Magilou...</p>
<p>There&#39;s a lot of people in line for prayers at the Sanctuary.</p>
<p>One young man near the castle sees the plight of malakhim. He&#39;s so close to the truth...</p>
<p>One soldier says &quot;everything is fine.&quot; Which isn&#39;t true.</p>
<p>A noble knows he heard &quot;a terrible cry from the villa.&quot;</p>
<p>I get my reward from the Bloodwing Agent for destroying the Beast of Blades!</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Velvet asks Eleanor to wait at the door, along with Laphicet. Bad idea.</p>
<p>Tabatha offers peach pie again. Velvet asks for info now. Tabatha tells her to take a break.</p>
<p>Velvet insists.</p>
<p>Tabatha points to a hooded person at the bar. She wants her to have him taken out of the capital...</p>
<p>Wait, that eagle next to him looks very familiar...</p>
<p>Velvet smells a trap. She asks where she should take the figure.</p>
<p><strong>Tabatha:</strong> &quot;Somewhere the authorities can&#39;t reach them.&quot; That could be anywhere...</p>
<p>Rokurou adds they haven&#39;t a hideout to go to...</p>
<p>Tabatha points out the Abbey hasn&#39;t heard anything from Titania.</p>
<p>Eizen&#39;s surprised by the news.</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s open to using Titania as a hideout. It&#39;s under the Abbey&#39;s nose, in a way. Rokurou and Magilou agree.</p>
<p>Velvet asks Tabatha if the Abbey&#39;s been &quot;harboring daemons.&quot; Tabatha mentions the griffin daemon was moved somewhere else...</p>
<p>Velvet wants more info on the daemon as a price for escorting the hooded figure out.</p>
<p>Tabatha apologizes to Eizen concerning Melchior and Aifread.</p>
<p>Eizen&#39;s not giving up on finding him, though...he plans on pressuring attacks on the Abbey until they can get Aifread back.</p>
<p>The Abbey will use Aifread as bait, and Eizen will spring the trap to return him to his ship.</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Eleanor and Laphicet are still outside. It&#39;s night now.</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s reminded of the mission she&#39;s supposed to carry out...</p>
<p>She asks Laphicet if she wants to take a tour with her. Oh dear god, no...</p>
<p>Laphicet hesitates...but he comes along. Eleanor holds back though, thinking (rightfully so) that Velvet would get angry if they left alone...</p>
<p>That was close!</p>
<p>They&#39;re escorting the hooded figure out now.</p>
<p>Eleanor asks who it is. Laphicet smells a &quot;nice&quot; scent. If it&#39;s coming from the hooded figure, I&#39;m guessing this must be a rich person...</p>
<p>Laphicet and Eleanor notice the figure&#39;s hawk beside him. The hawk is &quot;well trained.&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet and Eleanor smell the &quot;nice&quot; scent again. Eleanor doesn&#39;t believe who that person is! Who is that, though?</p>
<p>My favorite Velvet face comes up again! She asks what they&#39;re sniffing...Magilou calls them &quot;bloodhounds on the hunt.&quot; Laphicet thinks they&#39;re &quot;talking about hawks.&quot; Velvet&#39;s confused.</p>
<p>Eleanor doesn&#39;t like the &quot;no questions asked&quot; idea.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;The less you know, the less trouble you invite.&quot;</p>
<p>A few people mention the King&#39;s condition, while the Bloodwing soldier at the gates wishes us good luck.</p>
<p>I save outside the port&#39;s gate.</p>

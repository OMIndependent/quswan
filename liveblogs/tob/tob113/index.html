<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;We&#39;re going to the front docks to escape. Don&#39;t forget that.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;I know. Arthur&#39;s first maxim, right?&quot;</p>
<p>Phi points out to Magilou about Velvet&#39;s condition so far...</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Her [vengeance] knows no bounds, and she&#39;s got all the self-control of a wounded beast.&quot;</p>
<p>She doubts if Velvet will make it out of Titania...</p>
<p>Phi tells her that she&#39;s powered through everything in her way. Magilou knows that &quot;everything has [their] limits.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;There is no blade that will not break. Nor is there such a heart. When the time comes, you&#39;ll need to make a decision. It&#39;s best you start figuring it out now.&quot;</p>
<p>The <em>Van Eltia</em>&#39;s already out of the prison hideout...</p>
<p>Dyle&#39;s tempting fate.</p>
<p>Then Grim reads the last part of the tome...and is in shock!</p>
<p><strong>What!? What happened?</strong></p>
<p>Grim tells them to turn the ship around! Full astern!</p>
<p><strong>Grimoirh:</strong> &quot;<strong>If what the book says is true, then Innominat is already...</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Everyone&#39;s now at the other entrance!</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;You&#39;re running?&quot;</p>
<p>Oh my god!</p>
<p>There&#39;s the Shepherd, with Shigure!</p>
<p>Rokurou charges at him with Stormquell! What a big sword Stormquell is!</p>
<p>Velvet goes after the Shepherd, but Phi stops her!</p>
<p>The Prince agrees, and wants to talk.</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;Step back, Your Highness. The girl before you wants nothing other than to kill me.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;You better believe it!&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen senses a trap. Phi wants to save her.</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;<strong>I&#39;m not your tool!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>He tries to punch Eizen in the gut...valiant effort, Phi.</p>
<p>Phi threatens to take care of Eizen if he tries to stop him. Looks like the crew&#39;s going to help her again.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Your Armatus isn&#39;t gonna stop me!&quot;<br>
<strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;Don&#39;t worry. <strong>I have another trick up my sleeve.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Shigure:</strong> &quot;That sword... is that orichalcum? Good <strong>job</strong>, little bro...never seen that before!&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Damn right...hardest sword there is!&quot;</p>
<p>A shockwave stops their bout!</p>
<p>Someone emerges...</p>
<p>The Shepherd tells Shigure to fall back.</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;<strong>The one to face Velvet will be Innominat.</strong>&quot; <strong><em>Oh shit!</em></strong></p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Shigure leaps back.</p>
<p>Phi gets in front of Velvet.</p>
<p>A bright flash of light!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ggzsITN.png alt="innominat summoned" width=480 height=270 id=hd-liveblog></p>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/1y9ViO9rqvs>Here&#39;s Innominat&#39;s theme.</a></p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s <strong>in shock.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Innominat:</strong> &quot;<strong>Hello, sister. Did you miss me?</strong>&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Laphi...&quot; That was a big twist!</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;So that&#39;s his game.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Innominat:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s right. <strong>I am Laphicet Crowe. And more. I am also Empyrean Innominat, the Suppressor.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen tries to fire his arte...no good!</p>
<p>Eizen tells Velvet to fight!</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;I know! This is just...just another illusion! I&#39;ll devour all of you!&quot; What is real?</p>
<p>The fight begins!</p>
<p><strong>Innominat:</strong> &quot;Velvet, that&#39;s what you&#39;ve been doing this whole time...&quot;</p>
<p>We can&#39;t damage him!</p>
<p><strong>Innominat:</strong> &quot;...struggling against all reason.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>Shut up!</strong> Don&#39;t you dare...pretend to be my brother!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Innominat:</strong> &quot;Your struggles are over. All your pain, your suffering...&quot;</p>
<p>Resistance is <strong>not</strong> futile, Innominat!</p>
<p>Before he fires his <strong>Annihilation Beam</strong>...the battle stops!</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Is this...the power of an Empyrean?&quot;<br>
<strong>Prince Percival:</strong> &quot;Exactly. <strong>This boy is Empyrean Innominat the Suppressor.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Shigure tells us we were late to the party.</p>
<p><strong>Shigure:</strong> &quot;It was never about the amount of malevolence the therions devoured. What we needed to awaken him...&quot;<br>
<strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;<strong>...was eight different &#39;types.&#39; Greed, conceit, lust, cowardice, selfishness, obsession. Those six Innominat had already obtained by the time you managed to tear the therions away. That leaves...just the two that Velvet carries inside her. Once Innominat has them, he will fully awaken.</strong>&quot;<br>
<strong>Innominat:</strong> &quot;And I don&#39;t even need an earthpulse for that. I can eat them right here.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou tries to stop him...but Innominat materializes his own sword and breaks Rokurou&#39;s!</p>
<p>Velvet manages to attack him!</p>
<p><strong>Innominat:</strong> &quot;Ow.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet tries to convince herself that he isn&#39;t real.</p>
<p><strong>Innominat:</strong> &quot;That hurts, Velvet.&quot;</p>
<p>He asks her if she&#39;s going to take care of him.</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s conflicted...</p>
<p>Velvet pulls everything in her power.</p>
<p><strong>Innominat:</strong> &quot;Velvet, it was always so hard for me. I was so frail. All I did was cause you trouble...Is that why...&quot;</p>
<p>Her hand...</p>
<p><strong>Innominat:</strong> &quot;<strong>Is that why you wanted me to go away?</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Hence why I would&#39;ve called her the Lord of Adultism.</p>
<p>She cries and hugs him...</p>
<p>This is so emotionally painful to watch...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;...But in the end, I couldn&#39;t protect you... All I could do was avenge you...&quot;</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>She lists her sins down the line.</p>
<p>No, he&#39;s playing you! He wants two of your sins...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;I&#39;m sorry...I&#39;m sorry, Laphi! It hurt, didn&#39;t it...&quot;</p>
<p>She begs Phi to heal him.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s Laphicet! He&#39;s...he&#39;s my brother...&quot;</p>
<p>Innominat smiles at Phi.</p>
<p><strong>Innominat:</strong> &quot;...But Velvet. I never wanted you to avenge me. I mean, it&#39;s that sort of selfish emotion that creates malevolence...that creates the daemons.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Innominat:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s why I&#39;m going to help Arthur. We&#39;re going to make all the pain in the world go away. <strong>Including that hate, that</strong> <strong><em>ugly</em></strong> <strong>malevolence in you.</strong>&quot; Oh my god...</p>
<p>So all of this revenge was for nothing.</p>
<p>The Shepherd explains his MO.</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;<strong>He will remake humanity into beings free from sin.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>They tried that before back in Port Zekson...</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;You take away all their sins, and people aren&#39;t people anymore!&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen points out that that was their plan all along.</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;It will be a peaceful world, free from pain.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;So your whole goal this whole time was to rob people of their free will?!&quot;</p>
<p>Yep. As his logic dictates.</p>
<p><strong>Innominat:</strong> &quot;I&#39;ll make this world a safe place free from daemons. That has always been my dream.&quot;</p>
<p><a name=6></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Now he plans to eat Velvet.</p>
<p>A big glowing circle appears beneath the crew. So this is how an Empyrean eats...</p>
<p>The circle turns into a galaxy, sinking them in.</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s still in tears.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>Everything I did I did for you...How could you...do this to...</strong>&quot;<br>
<strong>Innominat:</strong> &quot;Thank you. It&#39;s because of what you&#39;ve done that I need to make amends. You&#39;ve hurt so many people, and all for nothing.&quot;</p>
<p>Phi casts a barrier, and the fangs of Innominat come up!</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;Unfortunate.&quot; Oh, be quiet.</p>
<p>Innominat vows to look for them. His wounds have sealed.</p>
<p><strong>Shigure:</strong> &quot;A weapon can&#39;t be hard you know. It&#39;s gotta be flexible too...or it&#39;ll snap.&quot;<br>
<strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;If you&#39;re addressing me, do you care to test that out?&quot;</p>
<p>Shigure mentions that the Shepherd and Innominat can fuse! Oh my god...but it takes awhile.</p>
<p><strong>Prince Percival:</strong> &quot;Shepherd Artorius, <strong>what have you done?!</strong>&quot; I almost forgot about the Prince.</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s all according to my plan, Your Highness. Let us return to the capital.&quot;</p>

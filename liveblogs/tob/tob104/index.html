<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>The merchant tells us outside the town&#39;s &quot;nothing but daemons.&quot;</p>
<p>We talk to the brother and sister again, where the brother&#39;s excited about &quot;prickleboar meatballs.&quot; Phi&#39;s a bit excited too. But the meat hasn&#39;t tasted good nowadays...</p>
<p>The sister mentions what actually happened to Aball, and thinks the village would have been saved if the Shepherd came earlier...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;...Right...&quot;</p>
<p>A girl thinks this time&#39;s &quot;a rotten time to grow up in.&quot;</p>
<p>Down the steps, a woman says that &quot;it&#39;s been three years since there&#39;ve been [...] cats around.&quot; Taliesin&#39;s got no more cats... <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>The land here&#39;s also starting to shift...</p>
<p>A woman mentions the power of the Shepherd and his then-unseen malak three years ago...</p>
<p>A vet&#39;s weeping for the death of Niko... <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png> Velvet thinks that this vet was Niko&#39;s boyfriend.</p>
<p>A bard&#39;s reciting a song about the Shepherd.</p>
<p>The weapons merchant now has <strong>Spinach</strong> and <strong>Fresh Milk</strong> for sale!</p>
<p>The man near the fish stall thinks the weather&#39;s still fine, even when there&#39;s fog!</p>
<p>Eizen and Eleanor agree that Melchior also cast the fog as well. That man is tricky...</p>
<p>We talk to a promoter, but it&#39;s Eleanor, not Magilou who approaches him to start a show.</p>
<p>Eleanor wants to meet Majelu, that&#39;s why.</p>
<p>The elderly promoter overhears Eleanor about Majelu, mentioning Valta&#39;s great skill for his art, though he worries about Valta teaching Majelu. Valta never makes &quot;compromises in his art.&quot;</p>
<p>Now the show starts!</p>
<p>Magilou and Eleanor call themselves the &quot;Bienfu Keepers!&quot; Eleanor plays the straight person in the act.</p>
<p>This is a bit funny...</p>
<p>Then they get to the part where Magilou mentions setting her clothes on fire because it was very cold...</p>
<p>Eleanor now gets into her serious business mode. She would have been a very upstanding censor.</p>
<p>Magilou tells her that the fire joke&#39;s a joke.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Crime is not a joke!&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou &quot;gives up, for good!&quot;</p>
<p>The promoter asks if &quot;the duo&#39;s for real?&quot;</p>
<p>We get <strong>new outfits</strong> for Magilou!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Inside the bar I speak to the Bloodwing agent to get our rewards for defeating those code reds!</p>
<p>Upstairs, a young man wants to have a girlfriend &quot;like the Lady of the Lake.&quot; Nabgure <em>Mrfgvevn</em> ersrerapr?</p>
<p>Inside the sanctuary now, where the woman asks the girl about Hyland.</p>
<p>The soldiers around here ask for additional help from the Abbey regarding Perniya. The priest wrote to them, but the Abbey doesn&#39;t think Eastgand&#39;s important. The soldiers are in shock at the Abbey&#39;s neglect of Eastgand.</p>
<p>The man outside the sanctuary mentions that Taliesin might make a &quot;Shepherd&#39;s Day.&quot; So the Shepherd saved Taliesin first, huh?</p>
<p>Magilou mentions that the Shepherd&#39;s hometown was Aball.</p>
<p><strong>Man:</strong> &quot;Not being able to save Aball was a terrible agony for the Shepherd.&quot; No kidding!</p>
<p>But the man mentions that Taliesin wouldn&#39;t have been saved if he saved Aball...</p>
<p>So the Shepherd&#39;s Day also mourns the loss of Aball.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s right... lives lost can never be brought back.&quot; <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>I play a bit of Flag Fetcher...this game&#39;s more easier than the one in Beardsley. I win a new geoboard after beating the time record!</p>
<p>From a woman, I learn that the cats also got infected with malevolence. That&#39;s why there are none in Taliesin anymore.</p>
<p>Looks like the Abbey&#39;s leaving Eastgand alone...</p>
<p>From one of Aifread&#39;s crew I also get a new Class 4 Zone location: <strong>Serpent Isle.</strong></p>
<p>Indy Jones would not love that place.</p>
<p>Eizen&#39;s getting in the conversation. The pirate&#39;s creeped out by the snake woman monster inhabiting the island...</p>
<p>Benwick&#39;s surprised by the therions Velvet&#39;s brought back. Benwick is not a dog person (ur naq Zvxyrb jbhyq trg nybat). The poor guy got bitten by a dog when he was young...</p>
<p>Velvet tells him not to worry and let them bite her.</p>
<p>Benwick asks Velvet if she&#39;s alright.</p>
<p><strong>Skit:</strong> Phi takes it upon himself to take care of Orthie and Russ. The dogs don&#39;t like Velvet since she killed Niko... <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Bienfu wants Orthie and Russ to be his servants!</p>
<p>Technically, we only have seven if we count the dogs as two separate therions.</p>
<p>Rokurou suggests to Phi to leave the dogs to Kamoana, since she used to own one.</p>
<p>Velvet gets flashbacks from that night when she sees them...</p>
<p>Bienfu makes a little &quot;joke&quot; about the Abbey having &quot;dogs&quot;.</p>

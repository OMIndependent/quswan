<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>Now to face off against this Goldipen, which is a golden-glowing pengyon!</p>
<p>Look at that Goldipen!</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Red eyes, golden coat...it&#39;s Goldipen, all right!&quot;<br>
<strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;And she&#39;s even got that...quirk.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet warns us about the Goldipen...</p>
<p>Rokurou notices her drooling...</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Does that mean she thinks we look...tasty?!&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Does that mean she&#39;s a man-eating pengyon?!&quot;</p>
<p>Then Jude gets in between them!</p>
<p><strong>Jude:</strong> &quot;No matter how much Milla loves to eat, she would never attack a person without good reason! Wait, this pengyon isn&#39;t Milla!&quot; He falls.</p>
<p><strong>Jude:</strong> &quot;When I got your message, I ran all the way here without stopping to eat or drink...&quot; Oh my god Jude...</p>
<p><strong>Milla:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s enough. When will you people learn to leave this pengyon alone?&quot;</p>
<p>She assumes the crew&#39;s hunting pengyons...</p>
<p><strong>Milla:</strong> &quot;If you want to hunt the pengyons, <strong>you&#39;ll have to fight me first!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Here we go!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Who the hell are you?&quot;<br>
<strong>Milla:</strong> &quot;<strong>I&#39;m Milla Maxwell.</strong> And I&#39;m the Protector of Pengyons!&quot;</p>
<p>Originally I used Rokurou, then I switched to Velvet!</p>
<p>After her health is down slightly below half, she unleashes <strong>Elemental Mastery</strong>, her Mystic Arte!</p>
<p>Now we manage to take her HP down to a quarter and she unleashes it a second time to Rokurou!</p>
<p>Eventually, I switch Magilou with Eizen, and after nearly getting Velvet KO&#39;d a second time by Milla, we gradually win...</p>
<p><strong>Milla:</strong> &quot;You&#39;re strong... you know your way around a sword.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;As do you. I can see that Jude wasn&#39;t exaggerating when he called you the Lord of Spirits.&quot;</p>
<p>Milla&#39;s in shock at hearing Jude&#39;s name!</p>
<p><strong>Milla:</strong> &quot;Do you know him? I&#39;ve been looking all over for him!&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet points him out to her. Milla&#39;s relieved that he&#39;s safe...</p>
<p><strong>Jude:</strong> &quot;Milla...you can tell it&#39;s me?&quot;<br>
<strong>Milla:</strong> &quot;Of course I can. You&#39;re a lot smaller on the outside, but you&#39;re still you on the inside.&quot;</p>
<p>Jude&#39;s blushing at the compliment.</p>
<p>Jude mentions that he&#39;s not having an easy time as a pengyon...</p>
<p>Milla knows it too.</p>
<p><strong>Milla:</strong> &quot;Leia and Elise would probably be worried sick, and Alvin would tease you mercilessly.&quot; Especially Alvin...</p>
<p>Jude mentions that when he fought them, he changed back into his former self. Milla assumes that they&#39;re pengyon hunters!</p>
<p>Velvet denies it.</p>
<p>Jude tells her he was the one that told him where she was.</p>
<p>Milla apologizes for her hastiness.</p>
<p><strong>Jude:</strong> &quot;Everyone, thank you so much for reaching out to me.&quot;</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Eizen tells him not to think too much of it.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;We just did the same as anybody would.&quot;<br>
<strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;I&#39;m glad you found your friend.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;However, both of you are still stuck here.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Milla:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s fine. The two of us will figure something out. We&#39;ll get back Jude to his former self and find our way home to Rieze Maxia.&quot;</p>
<p>The goldipen shrieks and flaps its flippers!</p>
<p><strong>Milla:</strong> &quot;I&#39;ve taken quite a liking to him! Somehow he just feels familiar...&quot;</p>
<p>Jude, Milla, and the goldipen leave...</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;They&#39;re gone. Is it really okay to let them leave?&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet asks Eizen if Milla has anything to do with the Empyreans. Maybe they just came from another dimension the same time we woke the Empyreans up...</p>
<p>Eizen mentions that her artes are super different than what malakhim use...</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Agreed. I think I might actually believe they came from another world.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet mentions her taking care of the exorcist, and doesn&#39;t think that she&#39;s with the Abbey.</p>
<p>Laphicet considers her joining the crew, but Velvet thinks about it, and decides no.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;I wonder...I feel like she might be a bit out of our league.&quot;<br>
<strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;I don&#39;t know. I think you two have more in common than you care to admit.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou suggests leaving them alone.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Besides if they came with us, Eleanor might try to eat Jude.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;I would not!&quot;</p>
<p>We get our rewards for fighting Milla! 90,000 XP!!! Along with a <strong>Grandmaster Smith&#39;s Acerite</strong> and a <strong>Mini-Milla</strong> plushie!</p>
<p>This means we can upgrade our weapons up to level 10!</p>
<p>Well, that was a surprise!</p>

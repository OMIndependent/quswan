<p>This place looks very beautiful.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/68qzQmO.png alt="beautiful landscape" width=480 height=270 id=hd-liveblog></p>
<p>Magilou and Bienfu jump out of the portal. She points out we got eaten by an earthpulse.</p>
<p><strong>Bienfu:</strong> (to Magilou) &quot;This happened to you before, didn&#39;t it?&quot; Yes.</p>
<p>So Innominat&#39;s using the entire landmass above as his vessel?!</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;In other words, this earthpulse is now part of his body.&quot;</p>
<p>So Magilou escaped that...</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;...I guess I won my bet. Took long enough.&quot; So the Revenge-a-thon&#39;s over...</p>
<p><strong>Melchior:</strong> &quot;Bravo. You do have a talent, if nothing else.&quot;</p>
<p>There&#39;s Melchior and Teresa&#39;s other malak.</p>
<p>She commands Bienfu to keep the rift open! She puts up a barrier!</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;But if you run, my curse will follow you for eternity!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;It looks like I just won my bet. If I let you seal this rift now, I&#39;ll never collect.&quot;</p>
<p>Melchior pulls out one of his orbs...</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Illusions won&#39;t work on me. You can&#39;t break a heart that&#39;s already broken.&quot;<br>
<strong>Melchior:</strong> &quot;...That day, I interrupted my arte when your heart broke. I suppose I was taking pity on my student.&quot;</p>
<p>I knew it! They did have a history together!</p>
<p>Now he uses his gravity magic on her!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Phi wakes up...</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s there with him...</p>
<p>...and they&#39;re in an earthpulse yet again.</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s with them too, but now her conscience is catching up to her...she says nothing but kill and destroy...</p>
<p>Oh god... <img class=emojione alt=☹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Hearing Eleanor&#39;s voice, she comes to.</p>
<p>Velvet still denies that Innominat is her brother, thinking he&#39;s still an illusion. It looks like there&#39;s two betrayals she has to go through.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Then that means...<strong>he betrayed me, doesn&#39;t it?</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>She, in all her rage, lunges closer to Phi! She gets into his face! <img class=emojione alt=☹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Phi apologizes.</p>
<p>Eleanor tries to stop Velvet.</p>
<p>Then a flash of light...</p>
<p>It&#39;s a flashback...to Velvet and Laphi in the first moments of the game...</p>
<p>Phi and Eleanor are watching too.</p>
<p>Velvet slashes at the memory!</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s too far gone at this point.... <img class=emojione alt=☹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>She pushes Phi&#39;s head down and yells at him...<strong>stop shouting at Phi!!</strong> <img class=emojione alt=☹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Eleanor hits her!</p>
<p>Eleanor tries to calm her down...she does so. Velvet&#39;s acting different now, Mytho-like, and walks away. Phi picks up the comb she dropped.</p>
<p>We&#39;re at the <strong>Earthpulse, River of Nature&#39;s Power</strong>.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Poor Phi...</p>
<p>Phi decides to stay with Velvet. He doesn&#39;t have to owe Velvet anything after what she did earlier, but here he is. All he can do is just stay with her.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Having someone nearby can be all the help you need sometimes.&quot; That&#39;s true.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Just remember that I am always with you, Laphicet.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Whatever the case we have to get out of here. Let&#39;s keep moving for now.&quot;<br>
<strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;Yeah. I guess so.&quot;</p>
<p>And that&#39;s it for tonight!</p>
<p>Damn, that was long, and there&#39;s a lot to take in at this point...</p>

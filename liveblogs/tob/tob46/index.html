<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>Back inside the Yvolg Ruins...</p>
<p>From watching a playthrough, I have Velvet kick open a brick wall in this room...</p>
<p>...and take the treasures within, which include another Thorny Waistcoat!</p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s a bit intimidated by the Shepherd and Innominat&#39;s powers...</p>
<p>He keeps smiling cause &quot;he&#39;s still alive,&quot; and can still fight. That&#39;s why I sort of like him, he keeps his spirits up even in the face of danger.</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s not going to stop her quest for vengeance. A part of her wishes it, I think?</p>
<p>Rokurou is still joining her, as he owes both her and Laphicet for saving his life.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;I might not look it, but duty and honor flow thru my veins!&quot; Yep. Laid-back, yet traditionalist is Rokurou&#39;s personality.</p>
<p>He tells us to ignore Magilou though, and thank Laphicet.</p>
<p>Eizen next. He points out the rogues gallery that we&#39;ve become now that an exorcist is in the ranks. Velvet says that &quot;[she] had no other choice.&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet is important more than ever now...</p>
<p>Velvet asks Eizen if Innominat is actually an Empyrean. Eizen don&#39;t know.</p>
<p>So the crew&#39;s next mission now is to expose the Abbey&#39;s plans, and find out what they will use Innominat for. They&#39;re also going get info out of Eleanor as well, but lucky Velvet rules out torture from the list. It <strong>never</strong> works. </p>
<p>Eizen also adds that without a vessel, a malak becomes a daemon!</p>
<p>Magilou and Laphicet are outside the ruins...</p>
<p>Bienfu&#39;s looking over the unconscious exorcist.</p>
<p>I get new info from Bienfu: whenever a person makes a pact with a malak, they have side effects. In Magilou&#39;s case, it&#39;s excessive sneezing, and it happened during spring...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Outside, we&#39;re at the <strong>Brigid Ravine, Valley of Howling Winds.</strong></p>
<p>There&#39;s Laphicet looking across the ravine...</p>
<p>Where&#39;s Magilou?</p>
<p>From a nearby chest, I get <strong>Flouric Boots</strong>!</p>
<p>One of Velvet&#39;s idle animations has her look at her brother&#39;s comb...</p>
<p>We go to Laphicet.</p>
<p>Velvet tells him not to overdo it. Well, that&#39;s a fine greeting, Velvet! /sarcasm</p>
<p>He apologizes for disobeying her...</p>
<p>She thanks him for keeping her alive.</p>
<p>He looks down.</p>
<p>He didn&#39;t want to see her die... <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>She apologizes for treating him very badly, but he chose to come with her...</p>
<p>He asks if she&#39;s continuing her quest. He knows she is. No turning back.</p>
<p>And Laphicet&#39;s seeing this through to the end as well.</p>
<p>Laphicet makes a good point: Where exactly in the map are we? Where exactly is the <strong>Brigid Ravine</strong> located?</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;An object misused is one thing, a person misused is quite another!&quot;</p>
<p>She asks Velvet what her next move is, now that the plan to take down the Shepherds failed...</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s going to continue her quest, her &quot;Revenge-a-thon.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>No matter how many times I have to try, I’ll devour them all.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou makes a bet again, 100 gald this time.</p>
<p>Velvet says &quot;whatever.&quot; Magilou&#39;s coming along too...</p>
<p>Deep down, Magilou does care how this whole story plays out.</p>
<p>Laphicet has more info about Innominat, from the book in the villa. The crest on the book&#39;s cover says it all!</p>
<p>It does say something about Innominat but it&#39;s ancient. Magilou knows someone named <strong>Grimoirh</strong> who could translate it.</p>
<p>Last time, she checked Grimoirh was last seen in Yseult...hmm...</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s not giving up, though...</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s the spirit. Don&#39;t give up just yet.&quot; It&#39;s more fun for her when the bad stuff happens to the characters, yet they still carry on.</p>
<p>Tired, we head back to the ruin...</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Eleanor wakes up!</p>
<p>She&#39;s not happy that she&#39;s in the company of daemons...</p>
<p>She calls herself a disgrace and is about to cry again...but keeps it together.</p>
<p>She&#39;s about to come closer to Velvet with her spear...eeee...</p>
<p>Then she turns the spear on herself, no!</p>
<p>But a ball of light interrupts her and flies away from the ruin...</p>
<p>Eleanor follows the ball of light, it&#39;s the energy ball that Melchior threw in the portal!</p>
<p>Oh no, it&#39;s the Shepherd!</p>
<p>She kneels...</p>
<p>But the Shepherd assigns her another &quot;special mission&quot;: as a spy! She is to &quot;protect&quot; Laphicet and send him to the Abbey HQ in the villa. He tells her not to share any info about this.</p>
<p>Oh dear, it looks like the Shepherd&#39;s capitalizing on Eleanor as Laphicet&#39;s vessel...</p>
<p>The Shepherd is so scummy...he plans to have her manipulate Laphicet. He orders her to side with Velvet&#39;s crew as long as she takes him back to the capital...</p>
<p>She cites one of his maxims: &quot;<strong>Shame is only a fleeting emotion. It is will and reason that ultimately prevail in the face of calamity.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>He tells her to &quot;use her own discretion to continue the mission.&quot;</p>
<p>She salutes him... </p>
<p>...with Velvet and Eizen looking on...</p>

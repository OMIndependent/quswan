<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>I switch to Rokurou for one battle. For his martial artes he uses his twin swords, and for his hidden artes he uses elemental seals.</p>
<p>The game notes that he has non-elemental hidden artes...</p>
<p>I have a long way to go before the party levels up again...</p>
<p>I go back to Beardsley to sell tons of stuff...and I boost the shop&#39;s level! I get a Wanderer&#39;s Ventite, which boosts map movement speed by 10 percent!</p>
<p>After buying an item on sale and a few ingredients, I wander around the village a bit...</p>
<p>I laugh a bit after seeing the yak that burped at Rokurou again...</p>
<p>Now to face Dyle...</p>
<p>I fight some more monsters first. Lucky I don&#39;t have to worry about TP in this <em>Tales</em> game. That&#39;s probably why there are no Orange Gels here...</p>
<p>I&#39;m really tempted to fight the masked bat monster...</p>
<p>After more fighting, I get a new title for Velvet!</p>
<p>I face the masked bat monster: the <strong>Bat Baron!</strong></p>
<p>We wear him down with elemental artes since he&#39;s strong against non-elemental attacks...</p>
<p>And he can call reinforcements too!?</p>
<p>But he staggers us and I get pummeled to a game over for the second time!</p>
<p>After a long struggle, we finally beat the Bat Baron! As a reward, we get the <strong>Acrobat&#39;s Ventite!</strong></p>
<p>Near wounded after a battle or two, we rest up before taking on Dyle!</p>
<p>I read the Bat Baron&#39;s stats: his defense increases when near death...</p>
<p>That was a tough miniboss!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Now at a tar-filled lake...</p>
<p>There&#39;s an exorcist orderly in the pool...</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Did he slip and fall?&quot;</p>
<p>And there&#39;s Dyle, with sword and shield!</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;No! He was thrown in!&quot;</p>
<p>The game now gives me more pointers on weak point combos...and Daemon Dyle is weak against fire, earth, and demihuman attacks. I adjust Velvet&#39;s and Rokurou&#39;s artes accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;We&#39;ve found our murderer!&quot;<br>
<strong>Dyle:</strong> &quot;More fools from Hellawes. Hunting me down, eh?&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;It seems that way.&quot;</p>
<p>Dyle unleashes his multiple stabs and vortex attacks, but it doesn&#39;t hold the party for very long!</p>
<p>Our defense is down...</p>
<p>Dyle&#39;s down!</p>
<p><strong>Dyle:</strong> &quot;I won&#39;t die yet! Not until I have my revenge!&quot; Another vengeful one!<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Revenge?&quot;<br>
<strong>Dyle:</strong> &quot;Those [members] at the guild who tried to kill me! They want me to take the fall for their smuggling operation!&quot; <strong>What!?</strong></p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Dyle continues. The entire guild was involved in smuggling. Dyle had his part to play, and there were &quot;benefits&quot; for him.</p>
<p>Rokurou agrees, saying that &quot;it would take more than one person to dig that tunnel into the warehouse.&quot;</p>
<p>Dyle points out the Abbey eventually found out about their &quot;extralegal activities.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;And dead men tell no tales. So they blame it on you and kill you to cover it up. Looks like it&#39;s not going quite how they planned.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh my god, more crooked guilds doing crooked things...</p>
<p>Velvet asks how Dyle will plan his revenge: a raid on the city. Velvet thinks it&#39;s a bad idea. Dyle just wants his revenge against the guild that betrayed him...it&#39;s just like Velvet&#39;s story all over again.</p>
<p>Velvet cuts off Dyle&#39;s tail!</p>
<p>Yeesh....</p>
<p>Velvet will use the tail to announce that Dyle&#39;s &quot;dead.&quot; In return for his presumed &quot;death,&quot; she wants the ship fixed.</p>
<p>We get a new item for the <em>Tales</em> series: a <strong>Denore Bottle</strong>, which can allow us to go back to the start of a dungeon!</p>
<p>We speak to Dyle again who&#39;s surprised that we found him in the hollow.</p>
<p>Velvet says it was luck and a hunch.</p>
<p>Dyle hated Beardsley and wanted to leave it very quickly. Hence why he became a sailor, but he&#39;s not going to &quot;abandon his home again...&quot;</p>
<p>Dyle decides to live like a monster, and hopes for vengeance against the guild that wronged him someday...</p>
<p>On the way back, Rokurou asks Velvet about sparing Dyle.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Is this really how you wanted to play it?&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Listen, I&#39;m being hunted too. It&#39;s only a matter of time. I can&#39;t afford sympathy.&quot;</p>
<p>But, deep down, I&#39;m guessing she probably is sympathetic...</p>

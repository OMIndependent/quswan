<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>Knowing I&#39;ll be in for a fight, I do a little bit of prepping at Reneed.</p>
<p>From a Bloodwing agent, I learn that the newest bounty is the white-horned dragon. It&#39;s a personal request from Tabatha herself.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Since when did the Bloodwings become agents of justice, interested in protecting the world from dragons?&quot;<br>
<strong>Bloodwing Agent:</strong> &quot;Hey, we&#39;re not out to save the world. This is just to put an end to Zaveid.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor wonders if Zaveid did something. He&#39;s going after exorcists about the dragon. For the Bloodwings, it&#39;s not good for their ops.</p>
<p>Rokurou asks if Zaveid and the dragon are in Aldina Plains. They are.</p>
<p>She advises caution when taking them on.</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;Are you going to fight Zaveid again?&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;The time has come.&quot;</p>
<p>I head back to Yseult, and check the docks again. There she is...Morgrim, sitting on top of an open crate in the corner.</p>
<p>She&#39;s &quot;quite impressed&quot; that the crew woke up the four Empyreans.</p>
<p><strong>Morgrim:</strong> &quot;I just came to pass a little information to you, specifically that an earthpulse entrance has opened up. My guess is that it opened when you chased Innominat out.&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s interested in seeing more of the Earthen Historia.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;If we could learn more about the Shepherd&#39;s past, it might give us a hint about how to take on Innominat.&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou senses a trap from her.</p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s not worried. He knows Morgrim.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Shigure loathed any form of trickery. If Morgrim was that kind of malak, he would have struck her down long ago.&quot;</p>
<p>Shigure, arrogant as he is, is at least, honest.</p>
<p>Morgrim appreciated the compliment of trust from Rokurou.</p>
<p>Velvet asks where the earthpulse is.</p>
<p><strong>Morgrim:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s at the Shrine of Tranquility in Aball.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet knows Morgrim got this info from deep in the Abbey&#39;s network. She asks why give the entrance away?</p>
<p><strong>Morgrim:</strong> &quot;No special reason. I just happened to think of [the Shepherd&#39;s] malak...I thought it might be nice if I could help you learn a little more about her.&quot;</p>
<p>So we&#39;re going to take a look into Celica&#39;s past this time...Laphicet&#39;s getting excited about knowing more backstory.</p>
<p>I notice that Morgrim doesn&#39;t sit like an ordinary cat...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I decide whether to go to Eastgand or to Titania this time...choices, choices...</p>
<p>I go to Titania and have a rematch with Phoenix.</p>
<p>We manage to beat him, but he has another Mystic Arte up his sleeve: <strong>Like A Phoenix</strong>, where he fully resurrects himself and KOs half of the party!</p>
<p>Now, at least for this round I have a rough strategy: When he attacks, stay a reasonable distance away, but not so far as to be out of range!</p>
<p>But as I whittle down his health to a third again, it&#39;s game over for me!</p>
<p>Round three with this Rabbit of Caerbannog, and our party throws their whole relentless might onto him!</p>
<p>He revives himself again!!! Aaaaaaahhhhj!!!!!</p>
<p>It takes a huge ton of time, but we manage to get him!</p>
<p>Even the whole party&#39;s exhausted!!!</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> (to Phoenix) &quot;You weren&#39;t lying when you said you were the strongest.&quot;<br>
<strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;No kidding...&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Strong or not, you picked a fight with the Reaper. Time to pay the price.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s not having him take his life though!</p>
<p>Phoenix&#39;s eyes open and he springs to life!</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;I thought so. That&#39;s why you&#39;re called the Phoenix, isn&#39;t it? Your blessing has the exact opposite effect as my curse.&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet has an idea. Phoenix could protect Eizen&#39;s sister with his power.</p>
<p><strong>Phoenix:</strong> &quot;I admit defeat...I await your command.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;<strong>No.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Phoenix&#39;s pupils agape!</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;I believe we should each steer our own ships through life&#39;s waters. I know that the life I&#39;ve chosen is a selfish one...and I know that it leaves my sister lonely and sad. But...it&#39;s also the only way I know how to live. If I gave you a command it would be denying something at the very core of my being. So no, I won&#39;t do it.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Except...if you&#39;re able, I want you to use your powers to protect my sister. Protect her from daemons and malevolence...and...from any dragon who may one day attack her...&quot;<br>
<strong>Phoenix:</strong> &quot;A dragon?! Are you serious?&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen considers it a request from him.</p>
<p><strong>Phoenix:</strong> &quot;Well then, I accept your request, as your friend! But in return, I have something to ask of you. I want you to write her another letter. But this time, no hiding what you&#39;re truly thinking. I&#39;ll wait as long as it takes for you to write it.&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen didn&#39;t need a second, as he pulls out his letter that he&#39;s written and kept for awhile...</p>
<p>Phoenix does his flowery vows to Eizen that he will give the letter to his sister.</p>
<p><strong>Phoenix:</strong> &quot;After all, <strong>I&#39;m the Phoenix! With me, life rises anew from the ashes!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen thanks him.</p>
<p>Phoenix calls on the White Turtlez to escort him out!</p>
<p>He jumps inside the small crate, and with a flash of light, vanishes!</p>
<p>The White Turtlez vows to also bring the package to Eizen&#39;s sister.</p>
<p><strong>Phoenix:</strong> &quot;Farewell, friend!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;That Phoenix, what a guy! He doesn&#39;t back down even when he&#39;s lost.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;I guess, but I liked what he had to say.&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s happy everything ended well.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Yeah...I guess I learned something today. Never give up before you try.&quot;</p>
<p>We win our rewards, with the crew leveling up a few times!!! <strong>200,000 XP, my god!!!</strong></p>
<p>We also win a <strong>Phoenix Glacite!</strong></p>
<p>It seems that now that we&#39;ve beaten Phoenix, I think we can take on the Shepherd and Innominat and win!</p>
<p>The Phoenix Glacite allows us to have a piece of equipment that has the effect of reviving us!!!</p>
<p>We win a <strong>Mini-Normin</strong> too! I put the doll on Rokurou&#39;s head!</p>
<p>Usually, I can take any battle, but <strong>that</strong> battle was one of the most challenging I&#39;ve faced in a long time! I&#39;m not joking!</p>

<hr>
<p>Back at the docks, Bienfu tells Grimoirh she can come out of hiding now...</p>
<p><strong>Grimoirh:</strong> &quot;He&#39;s so stuffy as always, that he made <strong>me</strong> sweat, and I was even hiding...&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Now that I think about it, neither of you showed your faces when Phoenix was here, did you?&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor asks why.</p>
<p>Grim explains with a simple analogy of Normins by splitting them into cats and dogs...</p>
<p><strong>Bienfu:</strong> &quot;The ones who like to be around humans, like Phoenix, are your dog types. The ones who prefer to stick around objects and places are the cat types.&quot;<br>
<strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;I&#39;ve heard people say that dogs get attached to the human, and cats get attached to the home.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou wonders if Bienfu&#39;s a &quot;dog Normin.&quot;</p>
<p>Bienfu says his powers are channelled through Magilou&#39;s guardians, and calls himself the &quot;cat type&quot; of Normin.</p>
<p>And Bienfu lays on the analogy of Normin personality types more, like a Type A and a Type B person.</p>
<p><strong>Grimoirh:</strong> &quot;Some--ourselves included--don&#39;t conform with expectations, instead choosing to live as we please alongside humans...&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet doesn&#39;t get the point about why they avoided Phoenix...</p>
<p><strong>Grimoirh:</strong> &quot;There&#39;s a gap between us that can&#39;t be bridged...like sky blue and sea blue...&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;C&#39;mon, aren&#39;t sky blue and sea blue basically the same color?&quot; No, they&#39;re not Rokurou.</p>
<p>Eizen agrees with me that sky blue and sea blue are different &quot;in hue.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;I didn&#39;t realize it could be such a big deal.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Let me ask you guys this: are pudding and custard the same?&quot; One&#39;s more thicker than the other, imo.</p>
<p>Eleanor would know the difference. To Rokurou, pudding and custard are &quot;more or less the same.&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet then compares &quot;sherbet and sorbet.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou now smugly boasts there&#39;s a difference, but he can&#39;t tell...</p>
<p>More comparisons from Magilou about sandwiches...which Velvet points out they&#39;re very much the same.</p>
<p><strong>Grimoirh:</strong> &quot;Anyway, you get the point now, surely. We&#39;ve long had our differences, and they put us in perpetual conflict...&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor now worries about Eizen&#39;s sister with Phoenix.</p>
<p><strong>Grimoirh:</strong> &quot;Nonsense. He can be obnoxiously brash and talks a lot of nonsense [...] but... Phoenix has a strong sense of responsibility.&quot; Along with a strong sense of justice. Though I wouldn&#39;t call Phoenix as &quot;talking a lot of nonsense&quot; if he can back his strength up.</p>
<p>Grimoirh assures us that Eizen&#39;s sister&#39;s safe with Phoenix.</p>
<p><strong>Grimoirh:</strong> &quot;Although, if you work him too hard, he&#39;ll start making speeches about uprisings and insurrections and all that stuff...&quot;</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>It seems everyone&#39;s back in the hideout.</p>
<p>One pirate&#39;s proud that Eizen&#39;s being honest to his sister. But as Velvet points out, Eizen&#39;s still a bit mysterious.</p>
<p>Now to look for the code red here...</p>
<p>Which we do at the entrance of the cell block!</p>
<p>After fighting Phoenix, every battle feels so easy...</p>
<p>...until later, where she casts an Explode spell on us!</p>
<p>It seems she can withstand 15 hits while casting her spells! Iron Stances!!! *shakes fist*</p>
<p>Rokurou gets KO&#39;d, but I revive him with our last Life Bottle!</p>
<p>We eventually finish her and win a <strong>Trident Glacite</strong>, meaning we get three skills for each equipment we get!</p>
<p>Outside, Velvet apologizes to Grim for involving her in her revenge scheme. Oh Velvet...</p>
<p><strong>Grimoirh:</strong> &quot;Eyes like yours spell trouble...but I like them all the same.&quot;</p>
<p>Kamoana has the dogs and Griffin (or Grawky) to watch over her!</p>
<p>Medissa realizes Innominat and his connections to the therions. Velvet is speechless, but says that she will protect them.</p>
<p><strong>Medissa:</strong> &quot;Your pride knows no bounds. You really do plan to kill the Shepherd and the strongest Empyrean, don&#39;t you?&quot; Citing &quot;common sense,&quot; she doubts Velvet will succeed. </p>
<p>We beat Phoenix, we could take on the Shepherd and Innominat, we just need more preparation.</p>
<p>Velvet tells Medissa to look after Kamoana. Medissa doesn&#39;t need to be told twice about that.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Sounds like you&#39;ve got pride of your own.&quot;<br>
<strong>Medissa:</strong> &quot;Hmph! It must be catching, I&#39;ll have to warn the others.&quot;</p>
<p>Dyle vows the same thing Medissa vowed. Velvet compliments him. He&#39;s embarrassed...oh Dyle.</p>
<p>We set sail for Taliesin.</p>

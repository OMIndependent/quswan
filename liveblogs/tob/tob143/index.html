<p>The vet, Niko&#39;s boyfriend, Lachen, asks for lilacs from the florist since he&#39;s visiting Aball... <img class=emojione alt=☹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>But he&#39;s moving on...</p>
<p>Velvet explains to Laphicet that lilacs mean &quot;a treasured memory.&quot; Lachen loved Niko so much...</p>
<p>A bard&#39;s playing festival music from Aball...</p>
<p>The cats are back in Taliesin...</p>
<p>There&#39;s a Bloodwing agent there on the steps of the sanctuary. News is that an exorcist praetor was bested by a pengyon. That must be either Jude or Milla.</p>
<p>The Bloodwing agent mentions that the pengyon had &quot;artes of earth, water, fire, and wind&quot; on her side. That&#39;s Milla.</p>
<p><strong>Bloodwing Agent:</strong> &quot;This pengyon sports red eyes and a golden coat. They call it &#39;<strong>Goldipen</strong>.&#39;&quot;</p>
<p>She&#39;s in the Figahl Icecaps and the Bloodwing guy warns us that &quot;Goldipen is...an ominous creature that signals the end of the world.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Why would you say that? Oh, now we <strong>have</strong> to check this out!&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet deduces what the Bloodwing told us.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;I&#39;ve seen a lot of things out there, but never anyone who has mastered all four elements. Excluding myself, of course.&quot; Magilou&#39;s never met the Avatar, has she?</p>
<p>Rokurou thinks she might help the crew, or it might be a trap, as Magilou assumes.</p>
<p>Eleanor thinks she might be associated with the awoken Empyreans.</p>
<p>Eizen&#39;s about to deliver a message to Jude, but Velvet tries to stop that. But he persists...</p>
<p>After speaking to people in the sanctuary (one mentions a wandering prince from Hyland), an old man at a bench mentions how war has taken more lives than daemonblight. True, and that humans start these wars. He&#39;s more concerned about that than the daemonblight.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>As we go down the steps to the bar, there&#39;s a couple talking...</p>
<p>The kids mention Zaveid!</p>
<p>Laphicet suggests asking them about Zaveid. Eleanor starts asking them.</p>
<p>Spring Breeze Ben, the father, sounds familiar...</p>
<p>Ben mentioned that Zaveid kidnapped him and the family!</p>
<p>The wife, Saliph mentions how he had them sent to his place where three children and Theodora are...Theodora?</p>
<p>Arwell, one of the kids, mentions that Theodora is Zaveid&#39;s girlfiend. So they took them in...and he took Ben and Saliph and asked them to cook something for the kids...</p>
<p>Arwell, Burd, and Foo enjoyed the meals Ben and Saliph made...</p>
<p>Ben and Saliph mention they lost their only child from a daemon attack... <img class=emojione alt=☹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;From a kidnapper to a savior then.&quot;<br>
<strong>Saliph:</strong> &quot;Until they came along, we&#39;d never even realized that malakhim have hearts just like people do.&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet asks about Theodora.</p>
<p>Theodora was well-loved, but Ben tells us she vanished one day.</p>
<p>Rokurou finishes his sentence, saying Zaveid went off to find her. The dragon at Aldina Plains is Theodora!</p>
<p>So Ben, Saliph, and the children moved to Taliesin...</p>
<p><strong>Ben</strong> explains Zaveid&#39;s nature: &quot;rough and tumble, but [...] a good man at heart.&quot;</p>
<p>They now live in the Spring Breeze House.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Inside the tavern, a man asks what happened in Meirchio. Rokurou says &quot;it was more like...taken over.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou and Eizen give them info about other places, mentioning that daemons are running amuck more often.</p>
<p>The man wants to explore Eastgand a bit more and settle a town there. The man wants to build around Lake Perniya. Eizen agrees with the location.</p>
<p>Then the guy pines for love. Eizen tells him not to bother about that, and points out the three women giving him &quot;icy glares.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;<strong>Speak not of dreams. Become them.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>More talk about love...</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;A long time ago, I read that the secret to finding love is not to fall for someone, but to make someone fall for you.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh my god, these guys...</p>
<p>From our expedition, we find some &quot;Terror Island Eyewitness Info.&quot; Hmmm...</p>
<p><strong>Skit:</strong> Laphicet&#39;s beaming excitedly about the vast coverage of our expedition map...</p>
<p>Eleanor and Velvet smile too.</p>
<p>Laphicet points out to Velvet that she had her &quot;can&#39;t help but smile&quot; moments too.</p>
<p>Eleanor and Velvet talk about their satisfaction of cleaning everything...</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;Could you not compare this to doing chores?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;The scouting vessel just contacted us. They say they&#39;ve found Terror Island.&quot; Oooh...</p>
<p>It&#39;s a moving island! Is it a turtle?</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;They say it absorbs power from all existence.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet thinks it has something to do with Innominat.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Outside, another <strong>skit</strong> plays about Theodora. Laphicet confirms what I said earlier: Theodora&#39;s the dragon at Aldina Plains...</p>
<p>Velvet thinks so too.</p>
<p>Poor Theodora...</p>
<p>Rokurou thinks it&#39;s impossible for her to turn back...</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s considering mercy killing too...but doesn&#39;t want Zaveid to see it, and decides that Eizen should talk with him. Oh boy...</p>
<p>Eizen knows that&#39;s not possible.</p>
<p>Laphicet wishes he could master his Silver Flame powers...</p>
<p>From a girl, we learn that there around 436 steps in Taliesin...</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We speak to a Katz looking out by the cliffs.</p>
<p><strong>Katz:</strong> &quot;Your attention, please, for an important announcement! To comeowmorate all your hard work...I&#39;d like to invite you to come to Katz Korner!&quot;<br>
<strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;...awesome!&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen&#39;s also interested since no one&#39;s ever been to Katz Korner. Eleanor also wants to go too.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Denied. It&#39;s a waste of our time.&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Oh, come on, Velvet! Quit being such a killjoy! Katz Korner is like an exclusive members-only club! Nobody [...] would turn down an invitation!&quot;</p>
<p>Katz mentions this as an &quot;op-purr-tunity.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou wants to see it too.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;I can&#39;t believe this... you guys are starting to sound more casual than the Katz now!&quot;</p>
<p>The invitation&#39;s open for us to go...</p>
<p>But I hold that thought and head to the port.</p>
<p>Looks like the people are now losing their reliance on the Abbey, and are starting to rely on themselves more.</p>
<p>Even they&#39;re now questioning the Shepherd after all the malakhim were freed.</p>
<p>Someone asks about the Lord of Calamity. Velvet doesn&#39;t mind it, as she brings up her brother&#39;s inquisitive nature.</p>
<p>The person has dreams to be a pirate, and vows to take care of the Lord of Calamity, and to &quot;protect his sister.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet gives him advice, saying &quot;the Lord of Calamity is really tough!&quot; The dramatic irony is written so clearly here...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;If you want to become stronger, you&#39;ll need to get your own compass first...I know a boy who found a compass. With it, he traveled the world and got really strong.&quot;</p>
<p>Benwick points out the return of the cats in Taliesin.</p>

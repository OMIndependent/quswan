<p>I do some more stuff around Midgand before making it back to port and to our hideout.</p>
<p>It seems I found the geotree for Loegres in the cathedral! Looks like even geoboards can be used in towns too!</p>
<p>I also locate the geotree for the highway.</p>
<p>Before the port&#39;s gates, we meet our friend, the White Turtlez.</p>
<p><strong>White Turtlez:</strong> (sings) &quot;Turtlez, Turtlez, keep in tight circlez...&quot;</p>
<p>He has a letter for Eizen.</p>
<p>Phi thinks it&#39;s a reply from the letter he sent with the pot earlier.</p>
<p>The letter&#39;s a threat, not a reply: &quot;I know everything that you&#39;ve done! Repent for your relentless deeds, you monster!&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou, annoyed face in tow, asks Eizen what he did to gain that threatening letter. No clue. No sender to return to either. Huh?</p>
<p>But Eizen dismisses it and asks the Turtlez about the other gifts. The pot&#39;s safe, but the &quot;nor dolls,&quot; not so much.</p>
<p>Velvet asks what <strong>nor dolls</strong> are. They&#39;re Empyrean dolls which are supposed to bring &quot;happiness&quot; if one collects a complete &quot;set of four.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Red</strong>, <strong>blue</strong>, <strong>green</strong>, and <strong>black</strong> nor dolls, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Do you think they&#39;re like that one we saw of Amenoch in that shop in Yseult?&quot; Those are Grimoirh dolls, not Amenoch...</p>
<p>They&#39;re figures, according to Magilou, that exude a kind of &quot;quiet radiance.&quot;</p>
<p>Phi asks Rokurou maybe the &quot;her&quot; Eizen&#39;s referring to is a girlfriend...Rokurou tells Phi &quot;he&#39;s growing up.&quot; Phi gets embarrassed...</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s nothing like that. She&#39;s my younger sister....she&#39;s the only family I have left. She and I live apart for...various reasons.&quot; The curse probably? Magilou asks that too. Eleanor chastises her, but too late.</p>
<p>Phi understands now. He offers to help find those nor dolls for Eizen. Eizen thanks him.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Skit: Cats or Dogs?</strong></p>
<p>Laphicet mentions to Eleanor a &quot;fight&quot; going on between the crew over which pet is the best: cats or dogs. Magilou steps in again!</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;In the shadow of every war are the battles of dog lovers and cat lovers. Between each side lies a divide, maybe not all that deep, but unbridgeable all the same.&quot;</p>
<p>She smiles.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;I&#39;d say we&#39;re lucky that the squabble you saw didn&#39;t escalate into anything more serious.&quot;</p>
<p>Phi makes a big mistake. He asks the crew whether they&#39;re dog lovers or cat lovers.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> <strong>Cat</strong><br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> <strong>Dog</strong> mostly, and sometimes <strong>cat</strong> &quot;because they&#39;re cute.&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> <strong>Neither</strong>, his brother loved cats thus he doesn&#39;t, and isn&#39;t for dogs because they wag their tails so much.<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> Same as Rokurou, <strong>neither.</strong></p>
<p>Here we go! Phi, you opened one of Pandora&#39;s boxes with that question.</p>
<p>Eizen prefers squirrels instead. He mentions playing with them when he lived with his sister.</p>
<p>Eizen sticks with <strong>cats</strong>. They remind him of his little sister.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Dogs.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;They don&#39;t betray you.&quot;</p>
<p>Phi tallies up the people who like cats and dogs...</p>
<p>Magilou says Phi&#39;s the tiebreaker and trolls Phi again. Velvet isn&#39;t too happy with what Magilou said. Magilou tells Phi he may have to go with <strong>dogs</strong> because Velvet said so.</p>
<p>Bienfu gets into the middle of it, stopping the fighting and telling everyone to admit &quot;they&#39;re Bienfu people.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet, flustered, asks why everyone in the crew should be &quot;Bienfu people.&quot;</p>
<p>I talk to Benwick and sail away.</p>

<p></p><h2 class=entry-title>Tales of Berseria - Part 88a: Into a Class 4 Zone</h2><p></p>

<p>I debark to a <strong>Class 4 Zone</strong> before going back to the hideout just to see what the place looks like. The entrance is pretty peaceful looking.</p>
<p>I go around, where I see a Katz Box in the back of the large circle and get a <strong>Fire Normin Set</strong> for Velvet as a reward!</p>
<p>Climbing the stairs...there&#39;s slime statues flanking the stairway.</p>
<p>I see a dark portal in the center of the circle.</p>
<p>I take a deep breath before entering, knowing how tricky dangerous these places are...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Is that a fighting arena of some sort? I don&#39;t see any daemons around.&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet notices the dark aura &quot;spewing out of the middle!&quot;</p>
<p>Even Eizen senses something from it.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s probably the vengeful spirits of those who fought and died here looking for glory! Oooooooooooo...&quot; Magilou u troll.</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s a bit creeped out. Rokurou smiles. He really wants this challenge.</p>
<p>I quick save before taking on the dark aura.</p>
<p>I get an explanation from the game about Class 4 Zones. I can &quot;<strong>Summon Daemons</strong>&quot; to battle them, and the battle doesn&#39;t stop until <strong>all</strong> the daemons are finished.</p>
<p>If I lose the battles here, the game tells me in red that &quot;I will return to my original pre-battle status.&quot;</p>
<p>I start the daemon battles!</p>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/dGaio9LIR9s>Here is the battle music for the Class 4 Zone!</a></p>
<p>They&#39;re mostly just waves of slime monsters we&#39;ve faced before...</p>
<p>We win! We get a <strong>Virtuoso&#39;s Ventite!</strong> Now I can use different artes while guarding!</p>
<p>The crew is exhausted as heck. Eizen now realizes why this is a Class 4 Zone.</p>
<p>Rokurou thinks positively, saying it&#39;s a great practice ground. Eleanor agrees, saying it&#39;s good to build up tactics, and strength.</p>
<p>I take a look around the <strong>Crustacean Quarter</strong> next.</p>
<p>What a view this place has!</p>
<p>I check around the arena again, where we see another Katz Box!</p>
<p>I head back to the ship and to the hideout!</p>

<p></p><h2 class=entry-title>Tales of Berseria - Part 88: Once Again to Titania (continued)</h2><p></p>

<p>Eizen&#39;s tired. Taking on a dragon takes a toll on even the best of fighters...</p>
<p>Velvet decides everyone should rest. Eizen oversees the preparations for the ship.</p>
<p>Phi decides to try finding more earthpulse points.</p>
<p>Velvet smiles.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;You&#39;re as stubborn as ever, Phi.&quot; It&#39;s like she&#39;s back with her brother again...</p>
<p>I save before heading inside.</p>
<p>Magilou tells Bienfu to sing her a lullaby to sleep. Poor Bienfu...</p>
<p>Rokurou tells Velvet Laphicet&#39;s in &quot;the lower cells.&quot; Velvet&#39;s cell particularly.</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s analyzing the facts we have so far: Malakhim can become dragons if exposed to too much malevolence. Exorcists still use malakhim. She asks why the Shepherd would hide this fact from everyone if he knew...</p>
<p>Our expedition ship returns, giving us a <strong>Cleric&#39;s Staff</strong> as a treasure! V&#39;z orggvat Nyonar vf n ersrerapr gb <em>Gnyrf bs Cunagnfvn</em>...</p>
<p>A pirate thanks us for being around the first mate to &quot;watch out for him.&quot;</p>
<p>Everyone&#39;s hanging around the entrance to the cell rooms.</p>
<p>Kamoana&#39;s sleeping in the soldier&#39;s quarters. She misses her mother so much... </p>
<p>At the lower cells, I hear Laphicet and Eizen talking...</p>
<p>Phi asks Eizen for any power boosts for malakhim...</p>
<p>Eizen sighs, and tells him.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;The majority of malakhim today have their consciousnesses sealed away [...] for the exorcists. But originally, malakhim were beings who received prayers from people and in return, bestowed their blessings upon nature and mankind.&quot; Kind of like Greek gods, or spirits, in a way...</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;So you&#39;re saying... that when humans pray to a malak, the malak receives great strength?&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Yes. In general, at least. Some malakhim like me buck the system and bring about misfortune rather than divine grace.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;Oh. That&#39;s unfortunate.&quot; Heh, he sounds so matter-of-factly deadpan in that last line.</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;But who would ever pray to me?&quot; <img class=emojione alt=☹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Maybe you didn&#39;t lead us to any therions, Phi, but it&#39;s not like we came back empty-handed.&quot;</p>
<p>She mentions the orichalcum episode, and the dragon in Aldina Plains.</p>
<p>Laphicet, all smiles, decides that our next destination is Northgand, near Hellawes!</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s smiling. Same with Eizen.</p>
<p>Velvet leaves.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;When I mean &#39;prayers,&#39; I don&#39;t mean outright worshipping. All I&#39;m talking about are earnest thoughts and feelings directed at you.&quot;<br>
<strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;I see. So I&#39;m already receiving prayers then.&quot;</p>
<p>Those are huge scratches on the wall...poor Velvet...</p>
<p>Eleanor points out our next destination: <strong>Northgand</strong>, &quot;north of Hellawes, near the Faldies Ruins.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;With the, uh, mischief we got into last time, getting into the city might prove difficult.&quot; Eleanor&#39;s witness to that.</p>
<p>Eizen asks Benwick about the state of Hellawes.</p>
<p>The shipping guild&#39;s gone and the Abbey isn&#39;t tight on regulation there, though. </p>
<p>Benwick says that unregistered supply ships have been transporting relief to the port, making our way in easy if we disguise as one of the relief ships.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Smuggling in relief supplies for our own disaster...&quot; The irony...</p>

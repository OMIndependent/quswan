<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>We go back to rainy Reneed, to check on Videl.</p>
<p>Videl&#39;s mother&#39;s at the entrance, where she gives Laphicet a note. We now have the fourth ingredient left to fetch!</p>
<p>But Videl isn&#39;t doing well, he&#39;s almost dying from the Twelve-Year Sickness...</p>
<p>Videl&#39;s mother tells Laphicet that he &quot;chose to be his friend&quot; when everyone else were afraid of him because of the disease...and thanks him for being his friend.</p>
<p>Laphicet asks for the book, but she doesn&#39;t want him risking his life for Videl...plus someone lent the book already. </p>
<p>Poor Videl...</p>
<p>Now Rokurou asks Laphicet if he&#39;s going after the fourth ingredient...</p>
<p>Magilou and Velvet tell Laphicet it&#39;s hopeless, though Velvet tells him not to blame himself at this point for Videl, calling the Omega Elixir search &quot;a fool&#39;s errand.&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou calls her out on that.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Sure, it might hurt now, but in time, it will just be another memory.&quot;</p>
<p>She starts grimacing evilly.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;A sad memory you&#39;ll keep tucked away when you&#39;ll need it.&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s not giving up though. Yes, Laphicet!</p>
<p>Velvet then tells him to keep looking for the final ingredient!</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Once you&#39;ve lost him, it&#39;ll be too late. No matter how sorry you feel. No matter how deeply you regret. Regrets don&#39;t change into memories. They hang over you like a nightmare.&quot; A taunting one...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;But you haven&#39;t lost your friend yet. Or your hope....hold onto it as tightly as you can.&quot;</p>
<p>So we gave away the <strong>Cloud Sheep Egg</strong>...and now we need to find the <strong>World Tree Leaf</strong>, which is in Davahl Forest!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Now to deal with the Fumes-and-Fruits business all over again...</p>
<p>We pass by the whole forest via geoboard.</p>
<p>There&#39;s an exorcist praetor holding a shining leaf...a <strong>World Tree Leaf</strong>. The praetor tucks it away...</p>
<p>The crew approaches him.</p>
<p>The praetor suspects that the crew&#39;s &quot;no ordinary travelers.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou thinks of taking it by force. Eizen rejects that idea. Eleanor wants to talk, Laphicet does so.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, Velvet calls him &quot;Laphi&quot; here...</p>
<p>Laphicet pulls his Oliver Twist moment here. The exorcist doesn&#39;t buy it, and asks him if he knows how to make an Omega Elixir.</p>
<p>He brings up his friend. The praetor asks if he has the other ingredients. Laphicet lies and says no. But he vows that he will save his friend.</p>
<p>He...hands the leaf over to Laphicet!</p>
<p>Laphicet asks if he&#39;s sure.</p>
<p><strong>Exorcist:</strong> &quot;We&#39;re supposed to put the needs of others over those of our own.&quot; Of course.</p>
<p><strong>Exorcist:</strong> &quot;You think not of yourself. I would be a poor role model were I to deprive you in your time of need.&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet takes it, thanking him.</p>
<p><strong>Exorcist:</strong> &quot;By the way, young one... perhaps this will help your cause. I&#39;ve been studying an old book (Videl&#39;s book, probably!), and it would seem that the final ingredient is &#39;a malak&#39;s prayers&#39;.&quot;</p>
<p>He credits the Lord of Calamity for taking away a lot of malakhim from the exorcists...as his malak has refused his prayers. He thinks Laphicet may be more successful than him.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The exorcist walks away.</p>
<p><strong>Exorcist:</strong> &quot;I have not faltered in my duties as an exorcist. The world must come before my family. I&#39;m so sorry, Videl...&quot;</p>
<p>I knew it!</p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s in shock!</p>
<p>Eizen puts the pieces together, since the exorcist was the one who took Videl&#39;s book, he was the one who went into Davahl Forest alone...</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Damn though, that&#39;s cold! Doesn&#39;t that mean he was willing to give up on his son?&quot; Wow...</p>
<p>It looks the exorcist failed his test as Father of the Year there.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;I think...he made the rational decision. Remember, he felt that there was no way he could get the last ingredient for himself, so...&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet looks pretty grim...</p>
<p>Eleanor points out he risked his life and his time to find the ingredient for Videl.</p>
<p>Velvet points out the truth.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Exorcists can&#39;t save the whole world. They have to live their lives conflicted like the rest of us. If everyone lived as selfishly as me, the world would be a wasteland.&quot; <em>Fury Road</em> style...</p>
<p>Rokurou knew that the exorcist knew his decision.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Am I dreaming this? Is Velvet actually defending an exorcist? Pinch Me!&quot; *Pinch*</p>
<p>Velvet mentions the other scenario. He would&#39;ve died. Eizen&#39;s grateful that it didn&#39;t come to blows.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Phi, I can&#39;t tell you what&#39;s right in this situation. But if Videl [passes], the sadness will be numbing. I can promise you that.&quot; She speaks from experience with the last part.</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;But I think even in sandess, hope can spring to life. As long as you keep living.&quot;</p>
<p>This game, I swear, the feels it gives me...</p>
<p>Rokurou points out we&#39;ve got everything to make the Elixir!</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;We&#39;ve got Laphicet, Bienfu, and Eizen! Surely we can squeeze in a prayer or two...&quot;</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Back to Reneed we go!</p>
<p>Sadly, Videl is losing consciousness...</p>
<p>They make it inside the room where Videl&#39;s sleeping...he&#39;s calling out Laphicet&#39;s name...</p>
<p><strong>Videl:</strong> &quot;I&#39;m sorry...Laphicet...I&#39;m sorry I told you to...go away...&quot; <img class=emojione alt=â˜¹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p><strong>Videl:</strong> &quot;I really wanted to talk to you...more...&quot; No, stop!</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;There&#39;s so much of the world you still need to see! You have to get better. So we can go on adventures together, okay?&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s crying...his tear drop is one of the malak&#39;s prayers the book mentioned!</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s the Omega Elixir. So it wasn&#39;t really a malak&#39;s prayers.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;It...was their tears.&quot;</p>
<p>The husband&#39;s home! But he confesses that he will take his priorities over his job than his family...then Videl walks out to see him! Aaaaahhh!!</p>
<p><strong>Videl&#39;s mother:</strong> &quot;He&#39;s fine! A generous friend worked hard to prep the Omega Elixir for him!&quot;</p>
<p>The exorcist is in shock at who he helped!</p>
<p>Videl reassures him that he helped &quot;[protect] the world in [his] own way.&quot;</p>
<p>He comes closer, emotions welling up...</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;All&#39;s well that ends well, hmm?&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Hard to believe we managed to actually make an Omega Elixir. That&#39;s one hell of an accomplishment.&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Oh, and here I was anticipating much wailing and dashing of teeth. Videl turned out to be pretty resilient, huh?&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Can&#39;t you just say &#39;good job&#39;...?&quot;</p>
<p>She does, and Laphicet thanks her, but he credits Velvet for telling him not to give up.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;All I did was rile you up. I wouldn&#39;t call it encouragement.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor facepalms.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Not you too, Velvet.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;...That was a noble thing you did, Laphicet. You really held onto your hope all the way through.&quot;<br>
<strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;I didn&#39;t want to give up on Videl...I haven&#39;t felt loss like you have...If I have, I don&#39;t think I would&#39;ve been so sure of myself.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Perhaps. But I think you&#39;ll still have it in you, even if you ever do lose something dear...that&#39;s just the feeling I get. Look, I&#39;m tired of Eleanor&#39;s grumbling, so I thought I&#39;d say something nice for once.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Could you not make this my fault?!&quot;</p>
<p>Oh Velvet...</p>
<p>Thank goodness that sidequest turned out very well in the end...I thought it would&#39;ve been over for Videl...</p>

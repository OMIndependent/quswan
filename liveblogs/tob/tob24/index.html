<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>I check the world map before heading out. It seems that the malak pirate&#39;s also heading to the Gate as well...</p>
<p>One pirate calls the malak pirate the Skipper...he was betting he would win...he blames it on the malak pirate&#39;s curse.</p>
<p>So the crew&#39;s actual captain is missing...</p>
<p>There&#39;s even a shop the pirates run called the Aifread Crew Emporium, or the Chat &amp; Patty Student Store.</p>
<p>We talk to the pretty blond pirate <strong>Benwick</strong>. Their plan is to get through the Gate...</p>
<p>Velvet asks if the Gate can be breached. Benwick trusts the number one so much that it can be done.</p>
<p>Rokurou points out the pirates&#39; huge trust in the malak pirate. Since he has his &quot;captain&#39;s blessing,&quot; the malak pirate&#39;s technically the captain of the ship.</p>
<p>She asks about sailing around to Midgand. Nope. The pirates got attacked and they lost their compass as well.</p>
<p>Velvet and the malak child react when Benwick mentions the compass.</p>
<p>I pick up an <strong>Earth Ring</strong> from a silver chest at the top of the cliff and save here.</p>
<p>I also check on the party&#39;s stats and other stuff before talking to Magilou.</p>
<p>Magilou has more funny and audacious stuff to say. She calls herself &quot;neither a sailor nor a warrior.&quot; She&#39;s a noncombatant. Velvet agrees with that.</p>
<p>Rokurou asks Dyle about the Gate.</p>
<p>Dyle mentions the fort and the naval fleet but its the Gate that poses a real threat.</p>
<p><strong>Dyle:</strong> &quot;Even a battleship couldn&#39;t blast its way through that thing.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvets thinking of alternate sea routes to avoid the Narrows...there are, but it&#39;s a long way out at sea according to Dyle.</p>
<p>Velvet thinks of teaming up with the pirates at this point.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;True enough! If forward lies destruction and backward lies doom, sideways is your only option!&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet calls her out on her lack of participation. Magilou agrees and runs off.</p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s suspicious about the malak pirate. I&#39;m suspicious of Rokurou at this point...</p>
<p>Magilou runs off to the malak child and asks him if senses anything. He looks blankly at the ground.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Well, things just keep getting worse, don&#39;t they? I suppose that&#39;s life in a nutshell, though. Anyway, good luck.&quot;</p>
<p>Dyle warns us not to get involved with Aifread&#39;s crew. Even a daemon like him knows Aifread&#39;s power.</p>
<p>Aifread&#39;s rumored to be &quot;as strong as an ogre&quot; and causes trouble...is this guy the game&#39;s equivalent of the Dread Pirate Roberts?</p>
<p>So they&#39;ve double-crossed the Royal Navy too, huh?</p>
<p>Dyle mentions the pirates&#39; awesome ship, the <em>Van Eltia</em>, as well...</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Thanks! I could get along with them just fine!&quot;</p>
<p>Dyle points out that every sailor wants to be as free as Aifread&#39;s crew is. Dyle also dreams that too.</p>
<p>Dyle calls himself a &quot;lizard of the sea.&quot;</p>
<p>With that said, we follow the malak pirate into the <strong>West Laban Tunnel</strong>...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> Funny enough, &quot;laban&quot; means &quot;fight&quot; in Tagalog, I think. Hope we don&#39;t get into many battles on the way there...</p>
<p>The tunnel looks very green, illuminating, and beautiful...</p>
<p>The enemies dropped down from the ceiling!</p>
<p>There&#39;s even spiders and scorpions here too...eee...along with three-headed slime monsters that are called Seeds.</p>
<p>We catch up to the pirate malak finishing a bout with a scorpion...</p>
<p><strong>Malak Pirate:</strong> &quot;So you&#39;ve chosen to trust a pirate?&quot; More like team up.</p>
<p>Velvet still doesn&#39;t trust him, and states that clearly. She decides to team up with Aifread&#39;s crew until they reach Loegres...</p>
<p>The pirate malak agrees, but with one warning. He flips a coin.</p>
<p>He says that &quot;[he] brings I&#39;ll fortune to those around him.&quot; He calls his bad luck &quot;the <strong>Reaper&quot;s Curse.</strong>&quot; As proof, his coin always lands on tails, a grim reaper&#39;s face representing tails.</p>
<p>His crew attempted to break through the fortress, which cost him five crewmembers.</p>
<p>Why warn them about his curse? Velvet asks.</p>
<p><strong>Malak Pirate:</strong> &quot;Even daemons don&#39;t want to meet an unfair death, right?&quot;</p>
<p>He tosses the coin to Velvet.</p>
<p>Velvet tosses it back, knowing the risks. I like her line here.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Works for me. I land on tails, I&#39;ll flip it to heads on my own.&quot;</p>
<p>The coin&#39;s on heads. The face of what looks like Znegry (ciphered) is on the coin...</p>
<p>The malak pirate&#39;s jaw drops.</p>
<p>Introductions are made. The malak pirate calls himself <strong>Eizen.</strong></p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Eizen explains the Gate is very &quot;impregnable.&quot; An attack is impossible on land or sea. Oh boy, not good...</p>
<p>Velvet thinks of trying both land and sea attacks. That&#39;s what Eizen wants. Bait the naval fleet, and then open the Gate by land. Afterwards, the <em>Van Eltia</em> will move away and head into the Gate after it&#39;s open, I think.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;One slip, and we&#39;re good as dead.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Then don&#39;t slip, and we&#39;re not dead.&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen says the plan&#39;s in motion now. That escalated quickly.</p>
<p>The tunnel leads directly to the fortress.</p>
<p>I check Eizen&#39;s stats and equipment.</p>
<p>More level grinding time...</p>
<p>Eizen&#39;s and Rokurou&#39;s exchanges, oh my god...</p>
<p>I have Eizen be leader this time.</p>
<p>My lord, this cave has endless inclines. It seems the fortress is situated at a very high location.</p>
<p>Now that I&#39;m controlling Eizen, I get some pointers for his Break Soul: <strong>Draconic Drive.</strong></p>
<p>Eizen wishes that he had a power like Velvet&#39;s powerful left arm.</p>
<p>We come across a set of large vines blocking the way...Eizen has some flint to burn it, though.</p>
<p>Velvet warns Eizen about the dangers of setting fires. But, as Eizen points out, they&#39;re daemons and malakhim.</p>
<p>As long as we have flint and kindling, we can burn vines...</p>
<p>We turn back to another part of the cave where there&#39;s a silver chest containing <strong>Amber Paper!</strong></p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We make it to another part of the cave. Rokurou&#39;s worried about the malak child being very quiet.</p>
<p>Rokurou even vouches for me, saying that &quot;calling him by a number is cruel.&quot; Good for you, Rokurou! Five for you!</p>
<p>Velvet asks what Rokurou&#39;s name means.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Well: son number six technically.&quot; Like Jiro and Shiro for the second and fourth son respectively.</p>
<p>Velvet thinks it&#39;s the same thing. Rokurou resents that.</p>
<p>The malak child sees a plant...he gapes and stares at it...then a scorpion comes by...oh my god!</p>
<p>Eizen stops the scorpion...</p>
<p>Velvet now gets worried, and asks why he didn&#39;t say anything...</p>
<p>The malak said that she ordered him to be quiet.</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s pupils shake, then she shakes him... I almost cried inside at this point... <img class=emojione alt=â˜¹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>It&#39;s a bit of an indication that she still has her humanity...</p>
<p>Rokurou tells her to calm down.</p>
<p>Eizen asks the malak child if he was bound by an exorcist. He nods.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;The boy&#39;s will has been sealed away. Malakhim have individual personalities. Just like humans. But exorcists have developed methods to seal those personalities away...&quot; Oh my god...</p>
<p>Eizen&#39;s not sure about a malakhim escaping the exorcists&#39; influence, since it&#39;s never been done before.</p>
<p><a name=6></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Another skit:</strong> Rokurou asks Eizen about exorcists binding malakhim&#39;s free will. Eizen points out the malakhim have lived alongside humans with their own free will. Invisible to humans though, until the Advent.</p>
<p>Eizen makes a huge point here that I agree with and that I might&#39;ve caught earlier. <strong>Malakhim aren&#39;t tools.</strong> Could the malakhim be a representation of oppressed groups?</p>
<p>The malak child recites: &quot;Malakhim aren&#39;t tools.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s still being brought up by her old master&#39;s teachings. She still thinks malakhim <strong>are</strong> tools, along with daemons and humans.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Everything in service to his &#39;utopia of reason.&#39; That&#39;s all anyone is to him...even my brother...&quot;</p>
<p>My god, this is deep...</p>
<p>Going back, we get some Rosemary but we can&#39;t jump over that wide chasm...</p>
<p>We turn back up to where we came from...</p>
<p>After plenty of exploring we find another Katz chest! But no prize...</p>
<p>Heading up, we come across a save point at the other end of the cavern! Yes!</p>
<p>After a few battles, we save here.</p>

<p>Reading a guide, there&#39;s supposed to be a Katz Box around here...</p>
<p>Expedition check: we get <strong>Frameless Glasses!</strong></p>
<p>I suddenly realize something: the Shepherd&#39;s &quot;birds&quot; question to Eleanor from earlier is probably rhetorical.</p>
<p>I finally find the Katz Box! No rewards, oh well.</p>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/03vu9GNk5f0>I almost forgot to put the music for this area, here it is!</a></p>
<p>I build the party up to level 20...</p>
<p>We make it to the top of the temple, before the door where the Shepherd is...</p>
<p>Rokurou stops to ask Velvet the Shepherd&#39;s fighting method. Velvet mentions his longsword in his left hand, and until recently, Seres, a fire malak. Now he has Innominat in her place.</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s strategy is to have her companions &quot;strain his [connection] to his malak,&quot; and then she&#39;ll eat his connection with her arm.</p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s job is to keep her healthy.</p>
<p>Rokurou thinks her direct offense &quot;isn&#39;t a bad plan,&quot; though Magilou knows there&#39;s a certain chance of death.</p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s worried about her. Velvet orders him to do as she says.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;So in the end, you&#39;re still just a tool to her. That hurts.&quot; <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Skit: The Flames of Hatred.</strong></p>
<p>Bienfu&#39;s asking if Velvet&#39;s going to do the job.</p>
<p>Attacking him directly...hoo boy...</p>
<p>Laphicet mentions the Shepherd&#39;s sacrificial action.</p>
<p>Eizen and Rokurou know it too.</p>
<p>Magilou tells Bienfu not to call the Shepherd &quot;lord&quot; either.</p>
<p>Eizen tells Bienfu that he&#39;ll understand why eventually.</p>
<p>Magilou brings up her narrator side.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;The fires of her hatred are all-consuming. <strong>Who will they burn in the end?</strong> Hmmm?&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s not relieved.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s a dangerous path we walk, but a debt is a debt. Come along, Laphicet.&quot;</p>
<p>If it were me, I&#39;d destroy the Shepherd&#39;s reputation first.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;He&#39;s here.&quot;</p>
<p>But where&#39;s Eleanor?</p>
<p>After scavenging and saving, we head through the large doors...I breathe.</p>
<p>Another set of doors to open...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>There&#39;s the symbol of <strong>Innominat</strong> above, and the Shepherd sitting on the ground, praying before the throne.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>Artorius!</strong>&quot;<br>
<strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;Daemons and malakhim. Unlikely companions to say the least.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Seres is here, too. In my stomach.&quot;<br>
<strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;So, you chose to be a mother bird, Seres.&quot;</p>
<p>He gets up.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>Things will be different this time! I will have my revenge...</strong> <strong><em>Revenge for Laphicet!</em></strong>&quot;</p>
<p>The malak Laphicet notices, but turns to the Shepherd.</p>
<p>The Shepherd drives the sheath in to the ground and draws his sword...</p>
<p>A blue aura surrounds him...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/6NsLbjH.png alt=aura width=480 height=270 id=hd-liveblog></p>
<p>We fight!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we can&#39;t damage him!</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;So this is the Shepherd&#39;s style!&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Boy howdy, are we dead!&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;But he has no malakhim!&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Remember the plan!&quot;<br>
<strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;R-Right!&quot;</p>
<p>I go into overdrive immediately!</p>
<p>We do little damage to him now, he guards well.</p>
<p>And he can do a one-armed fiery spin of his sword!</p>
<p><strong>Now the Shepherd performs his Mystic Arte on Velvet!</strong></p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Velvet falls down, Laphicet heals her, and she gets up!</p>
<p><strong>That man</strong> dodges very quickly! Velvet&#39;s easy to telegraph!</p>
<p>Oh my god!</p>
<p>Velvet quotes the fourth maxim.</p>
<p>The Shepherd moves away quickly!</p>
<p>Laphicet heals her once more, and the Shepherd recites the maxim by heart.</p>
<p>Now he unleashes his full power!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/qV1wDct.png alt="aid me innominat" width=480 height=270 id=hd-liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;<strong>Aid me, Innominat!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;His wounds have vanished!&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Such power... Is it really!?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Oh my god!</strong></p>
<p>Magilou calls it for what it is: &quot;cheating&quot;.</p>
<p>While healing Velvet, Laphicet&#39;s eyes widen at the sight of Innominat...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Hlq9bBL.png alt="velvet surprise" width=480 height=270 id=hd-liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>I remember you... that night... that terrible night...</strong>&quot; Oh no...what did she see?</p>
<p>The force of his power pushes the party away!</p>
<p>Laphicet advises they should retreat!</p>
<p>He&#39;s right.</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Teresa:</strong> &quot;You won&#39;t escape this time!&quot;</p>
<p>Oh dangit, reinforcements!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/rrs3B3c.png alt=reinforcements width=480 height=270 id=hd-liveblog></p>
<p>Oscar, Eleanor, Melchior, and Teresa come to the Shepherd&#39;s aid!</p>
<p>Magilou looks at Melchior. By the look on Magilou&#39;s face, it seems they have a history.</p>
<p>Oscar apologizes to the Shepherd, thinking &quot;Master Shigure&quot; was there protecting him.</p>
<p>Rokurou reacts to hearing Shigure&#39;s name.</p>
<p>The Shepherd tells Oscar he&#39;s out for training, and adds that Shigure would have wanted to take care of him too. <strong>What!?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Same as ever.&quot;</p>
<p>Melchior speaks.</p>
<p><strong>Melchior:</strong> &quot;[Shigure] thinks of only himself. Look what happened with Aifread.&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen confirms it. That big, elderly man with the monocle is <strong>Melchior.</strong></p>
<p>Velvet struggles to get to her feet.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;The one who most wants to spill your blood...<strong><em>is me!!!</em></strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Teresa tells the Shepherd to step aside and have her handle this.</p>
<p>Velvet tries to go after him. No dice.</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;Why? Doesn&#39;t it hurt? Aren&#39;t you in pain? <strong>Why Velvet? Why do you go on fighting?</strong>&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>Because...Laphicet</strong> [her brother] <strong>knew so much more pain than I ever will...And still, I...couldn&#39;t do anything for him...</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/HmCceWU.png alt=hands width=480 height=270 id=hd-liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>I&#39;m sorry...I&#39;m sorry...</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>What did she see? <strong>What did Innominat look like?</strong></p>
<p>Laphicet cries. Eleanor looks to the side (regretful?).</p>
<p><a name=6></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Teresa now faces against Laphicet, punishing him for &quot;colluding with daemons.&quot;</p>
<p>She orders him to take both his and Velvet&#39;s life. Oh my god... </p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;<strong>...No.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>She tortures him!</p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s done with Teresa!</p>
<p>The crest of Innominat is shining once more...</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;<strong>I don&#39;t want Velvet to die!!!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet breaks free from Teresa&#39;s torture! She&#39;s blown away by the shockwave!</p>
<p>A portal, a tear in space that looks like the Eye of Sauron, appears!</p>
<p>Eizen and Rokurou take Laphicet and Velvet! Magilou tags along!</p>
<p>Eleanor runs after them, and gets sucked in!</p>
<p>Melchior fires an energy ball into the portal...</p>
<p>Oscar goes to his sister.</p>
<p>Melchior&#39;s fascinated at what he saw.</p>
<p><strong>Melchior:</strong> &quot;Innominat&#39;s power reacting with the earthpulse. Extraordinary.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;<strong>I begin to see...Still...giving your brother&#39;s name to a malak. You&#39;ve strayed so far...</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>We tell Benwick we&#39;re heading out. He warns us beforehand not to read Eizen&#39;s letters.</p>
<p>I make a few stops before heading to the capital, making sure I haven&#39;t missed anything so far...</p>
<p>But nothing so far, so I head back to rest at the hideout once more.</p>
<p><strong>Skit:</strong> Laphicet looks at his beetle. He still doesn&#39;t know if the beetle&#39;s a stag or a rhino beetle. Laphicet has a good point to make here. Whatever species he calls the beetle is going to be very serious, knowing Eizen and Rokurou.</p>
<p>Magilou suggests taking out the beetle&#39;s horns. That&#39;s very cruel.</p>
<p>Here we go again...</p>
<p>Bienfu found a guide. Hope this is going to solve that debate...</p>
<p>Eleanor reveals the beetle to be...</p>
<p><strong>*Cue internal drumroll*</strong></p>
<p>...a thickjaw beetle, or a <strong>drone beetle!</strong></p>
<p>Then Laphicet is the one that tells Eleanor she&#39;s wrong. Now Laphicet decides that the beetle&#39;s called the &quot;Laphicet rhinostagros!&quot;</p>
<p>Well, that&#39;s that!</p>
<p>Now off to Port Zekson!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>A Bloodwing porter&#39;s off to see us, delivering a message from Tabatha.</p>
<p><strong>Porter:</strong> &quot;Says there&#39;s some sorta nasty daemon running around in the <strong>Aldina Plains</strong>...east of Loegres. She thought it might be the one you&#39;re looking for...&quot; Oooh...</p>
<p>Magilou points out the highway there was closed down. It&#39;s reopened.</p>
<p>He tells us that beyond the plains is <strong>Stonebury</strong>, and tells us a Bloodwing that saw the daemon.</p>
<p>So our next stop is <strong>Stonebury</strong>.</p>
<p>Laphicet mentions that&#39;s where he sensed something. Eizen interrupts.</p>
<p>So Eizen cut him off so the Bloodwings wouldn&#39;t know any more info we have...</p>
<p>Hmmm, I thought Laphicet was going to mention a domain, not an earthpulse point.</p>
<p>Laphicet gets more info about how the underworld operates. They&#39;re not friends nor enemies...</p>
<p>Eleanor asks why not trust them? Eizen knew that the messenger was expecting us. To him, it could be a trap.</p>
<p>Velvet points out the Bloodwings&#39; quickness on picking up their intel.</p>
<p>Eizen tells us the usual &#39;we have to be one step ahead of them&#39; spiel.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;We&#39;ve got each others back, as long as we hold a knife up our sleeve. That&#39;s what counts as &#39;trust&#39; in the underworld.&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet points out at least &quot;Tabatha&#39;s cooking&#39;s tasty.&quot; True.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Skit:</strong> It&#39;s everyone&#39;s first trip to east of Midgand. Rokurou wonders why the road was closed.</p>
<p>Eleanor explains that there was a tornado there...</p>
<p>Global cooling in the world of Desolation is real.</p>
<p>Laphicet wonders what the east of Midgand looks like...Bienfu mentions the beautiful forest flora and fauna. Plus, the village is quiet.</p>
<p>Bienfu knows about east Midgand since his lover lived there. Magilou points it out, and teases Bienfu again about his love life.</p>
<p>The docksman, in return for the high fees, promises a free supply of ship wax for the <em>Van Valvali</em>...</p>
<p>A citizen points out something happens everytime the <em>Van Valvali</em> debarks at the port.</p>
<p>Two new code reds await: a <strong>King Peacock</strong>, and a <strong>Dryad!</strong></p>
<p>Inside the inn, we play a new minigame: Mug Match!</p>
<p>Before I do, I pay 1000 Tales Coins to get an <strong>Exorcist Uniform</strong> for Eleanor!</p>
<p>This minigame&#39;s a bit tricky, but I get the hang of it quickly!</p>
<p>We talk to a man on the bench who says that the Shepherd and the exorcists have sorted out the messes the crew made and are after them.</p>
<p>Magilou indirectly points out Velvet&#39;s hatred of the Shepherd (she doesn&#39;t mention her by name), and calls Velvet a name again. Velvet doesn&#39;t take that too well...</p>
<p>We talk to a professional couple outside, mentioning Stonebury&#39;s open and everyone there&#39;s okay. They mention their relief at their apprentice still okay. So the man&#39;s the architect for the royal family and the Abbey, huh?</p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s curious about why the apprentice went to Stonebury. The architect&#39;s rather grumpy...and his wife is the translator of his grumpiness. She tells us to visit the apprentice in Stonebury. She apologizes for her husband&#39;s behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it. I&#39;m used to people like that.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Hey, what&#39;s that supposed to mean?&quot;</p>
<p>The architect does have some sage advice about trying something: &quot;Go out there and do it.&quot; The wife asks why he doesn&#39;t try saying that to his apprentice.</p>
<p>Princessia sales are booming, since a lot of people have lost their loved ones... <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>

<hr>
<p>The guard reminds us to be careful in the Aldina Plains, noting the climate there.</p>
<p>We go to the capital instead.</p>
<p>A Bloodwing guard tells us about Stonebury’s history. They used to worship dragons there...hmmm...then the Opening happened...</p>
<p>From another guard in the town square, it seems the Abbey is planning something. Oh, dear...</p>
<p>The sky&#39;s turning foggy. Is it because we let Griffin out of his cage?</p>
<p>I decide to do the waiting tables minigame, since after reading the guide, I think I might get new costumes for everyone...</p>
<p>Only Laphicet gets to be a waiter.</p>
<p>I do one round, but I get no costume.</p>
<p>After doing three rounds, I get Laphicet <strong>Serving Clothes!</strong> Along with a <strong>Bow Tie!</strong></p>
<p>It looks like Velvet&#39;s next on the roster.</p>
<p>Success! I get Velvet&#39;s waiting outfit, and a <strong>Ribbon!</strong> </p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s next to wait tables.</p>
<p>There&#39;s also another Mug Match minigame here too...</p>
<p>Since my controller&#39;s almost out of power, I leave and save at the square.</p>
<p>Tbh, my hands were shaking when I played this minigame...</p>

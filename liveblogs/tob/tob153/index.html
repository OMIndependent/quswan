<p>I make it to the front gates and save there, a bit nervous at what will happen next...</p>
<p>Dyle&#39;s got more bad news!</p>
<p>Kamoana turned back into a therion again! Medissa lured Kamoana away from town to ensure she didn&#39;t cause any havoc...</p>
<p>Dyle tells us they&#39;re off at Mt. Killaraus.</p>
<p>Velvet asks Eleanor for her permission to take over as lead. She does so.</p>
<p>Dyle regrets that he was unable to do anything...</p>
<p>We get our reward for taking care of the Boss Troll, who was on the code red list...</p>
<p>We then head up to Mt. Killaraus...</p>
<p>Medissa and Kamoana are not at the entrance. They might be where we either fought Shigure or Melchior...</p>
<p>No, they&#39;re inside the first area of the cavern...</p>
<p>Medissa tells Kamoana she can eat her if she&#39;s hungry!? Oh dear...</p>
<p>Eleanor goes to her. Laphicet&#39;s worried, but Velvet stops him.</p>
<p>Eleanor tells her she has the medicine.</p>
<p>Kamoana won&#39;t take it. She knows Eleanor&#39;s lying...then Eleanor tries one berry herself!</p>
<p>Kamoana calms down and she takes the berry...she turns back, knowing that Eleanor lied about that. She falls asleep...</p>
<p>Back at the inn, Medissa tells us Kamoana&#39;s feeling better, and thanks Eleanor for her help.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;I may be weak, but as long as I can stay true to myself and live life as fully as I can, I figure my mom will, maybe understand...&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;You already seem pretty strong to me, Eleanor.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Seriously?!&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s the parts you don&#39;t think about that are the strongest.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor doesn&#39;t get what she&#39;s saying.</p>
<p>Medissa talks more about mothers meaning well again. It&#39;s almost a week close to Mother&#39;s Day by the time I&#39;m writing this...</p>
<p>Laphicet noticed Eleanor blushing after Medissa talked with her. Velvet calls it &quot;girl talk&quot; to Laphicet. Laphicet also blushes and backs away.</p>
<p>Velvet, you teaser...</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;I may not be a mother, but I think I do understand. When I&#39;m around Laphicet or Kamoana...strong or weak, level headed or a little lost, it doesn&#39;t matter...all kids deserve to have a good life.&quot;</p>
<p>End of sidequest, and I get a <strong>Color Variant Outfit Set</strong> for Eleanor! The outfit&#39;s red, pink, and white...</p>

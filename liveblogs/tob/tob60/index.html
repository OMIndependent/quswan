<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>Inside the tower, there&#39;s a lot of glowing blue light around the edges of the floor...it&#39;s the water that&#39;s glowing...</p>
<p>There&#39;s also shrubs growing on ledges above in the center of this passage.</p>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/2YAAuBrHRjM>The music sounds pretty mysterious...</a></p>
<p>I find the stairs and climb up the tower...</p>
<p>Eleanor asks about Aifread&#39;s disappearance. Eizen points out her inquisitive nature. She considers it &quot;a habit [she] picked up [as an exorcist]...&quot;</p>
<p>So it was a year when Aifread vanished. And he fought Zaveid, with a pendulum on the ground.</p>
<p>Magilou tells Eleanor about Aifread&#39;s imprisonment in Titania. She&#39;s shocked that Melchior freed him. So she had no knowledge of what the Abbey does at all behind-the-scenes, huh? But she notes that there were a lot of casualties involved, but no official &quot;deployment&quot; of sorts...hmmm...this is getting sketchy.</p>
<p>Eleanor was told, or more likely, ordered, to stop investigating any further by Legate Melchior...hmmm....</p>
<p>I head into the mess hall, where I find a <strong>Halberd</strong> for Eleanor! It&#39;s useful against zombies.</p>
<p>Holy heck! Across the mess hall, I see Zaveid captured!</p>
<p>I go back down first to the other side of the tower for more treasure before going to him!</p>
<p>That&#39;s not Zaveid, it&#39;s <strong>Aifread!</strong></p>
<p>Velvet and Eizen confirm it.</p>
<p>He greets Eizen. Eizen tells him that he could&#39;ve sent a letter.</p>
<p>Eizen has a little brother?</p>
<p>Holy heck! Eizen punched Aifread! This guy&#39;s a fake! No, it&#39;s an illusion!</p>
<p>Eizen has no brother.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Enough of your tricks!&quot; </p>
<p>He turns around, seeing a girl with an umbrella! </p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/AMhe88I.png alt="girl with umbrella" width=480 height=270 id=hd-liveblog></p>
<p>Bu zl tbq, vg&#39;f ure! Rqan!</p>
<p>Eizen&#39;s surprised to see her! </p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/zLPcvvF.png alt="girl with umbrella 2" width=480 height=270 id=hd-liveblog></p>
<p>She lowers her umbrella... </p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>...Then she gets shot! She&#39;s actually an exorcist malak illusioned up as the girl! And Zaveid fired on the malak! He thanks Eizen for the help.</p>
<p>He calls for Melchior. There&#39;s Melchior!</p>
<p><strong>Melchior:</strong> &quot;Breaking through my double illusion. Impressive.&quot;<br>
<strong>Zaveid:</strong> &quot;I make it a point not to fall for the same tricks twice.&quot;</p>
<p>Melchior now summons three malakhim. One of the malakhim asks why they&#39;re there...</p>
<p>Melchior notices something about her consciousness returning, and fires an energy ball of darkness at the malak!</p>
<p>She transforms into a dragon!</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s in shock at what Melchior did!</p>
<p>The other two malakhim transform as well!</p>
<p><strong>Melchior:</strong> &quot;A chain reaction...Your Reaper&#39;s Curse is quite the dreadful affliction, isn&#39;t it?&quot; He walks away, with Zaveid chasing after him.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Heads up...wyverns coming!&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Why would an exorcist create a daemon?&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou tells her to not worry about that matter.</p>
<p>After a semi-long miniboss fight, Zaveid&#39;s captured Melchior!</p>
<p><strong>Melchior:</strong> (smiles) &quot;Oh, are you sure about that?&quot;</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Eizen and Velvet strike at the dragons! Zaveid&#39;s in shock at Velvet&#39;s therion power!</p>
<p>Zaveid then stops her! They start fighting!</p>
<p>With the gun, he shoots the wyvern, resurrecting him! I&#39;m just as confused as Eleanor right now regarding Zaveid&#39;s actions...</p>
<p>Zaveid&#39;s not happy about how Velvet&#39;s crew operates...</p>
<p><strong>Zaveid:</strong> &quot;You folks jump in and kill without a second thought! Is that your &#39;creed&#39;?&quot;</p>
<p>Melchior&#39;s pleased, saying he&#39;s looking for Zaveid&#39;s &quot;Siegfried&quot; power. What is he talking about?</p>
<p>Melchior casts a green energy ball around Zaveid&#39;s gun to examine it...</p>
<p>...then he warps away and says &quot;[his] work here is done.&quot; Zaveid chases after him!</p>
<p>What the heck was that all about?</p>
<p>We climb further up the tower, rescuing a Katz along the way!</p>
<p>At the head of the staircase before a locked door, I find another gold chest containing a <strong>Simple Ribbon</strong>!</p>
<p>Melchior and Zaveid are now out of the tower...</p>
<p>Zaveid fails to find Melchior.</p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s relieved that Zaveid&#39;s okay.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Velvet points out Melchior didn&#39;t steal Zaveid&#39;s gun. Magilou also makes a good point, that Melchior could have made replicas of the gun just by studying the workings of the thing.</p>
<p>Magilou tells us Melchior&#39;s &quot;specialty&quot;: research and examination.</p>
<p>Magilou says the Abbey brought the arte &quot;from another continent.&quot; Hmmm...</p>
<p>So Siegfried&#39;s the name of the gun, not some hidden power Zaveid has.</p>
<p>Eizen asks him why he has that.</p>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/rdTz3SORAiU>Zaveid&#39;s theme plays, it starts off as a simple guitar, symbolic of Zaveid&#39;s free nature.</a></p>
<p>So Zaveid used to be enslaved to the exorcists, mind controlled by &quot;Innominat&#39;s domain.&quot;</p>
<p>After Aifread used Siegfried on Zaveid, he woke up. Then, Aifread and Zaveid had a memorable fight.</p>
<p><strong>Zaveid:</strong> &quot;He might&#39;ve been a human, but that guy was a beast! He put a song in my soul.&quot; Eizen smiles.</p>
<p>But Melchior then &quot;spirited Aifread away&quot; with his magic...</p>
<p>Rokurou asks why Melchior took Aifread instead of getting Siegfried.</p>
<p>It turns out Aifread distracted Melchior and tossed the gun over to Zaveid.</p>
<p>The buckle on Zaveid&#39;s belt has hands shaking each other&#39;s hand, like some form of agreement&#39;s been made.</p>
<p>So Aifread trusts Zaveid, huh?</p>
<p>Zaveid decides to find Aifread on his own. Velvet warns him he has little time to rescue Aifread.</p>
<p>Magilou points out that Melchior wasn&#39;t able to get info on Siegfried from Aifread. Now Aifread&#39;s...no, I can&#39;t say it. I&#39;m not sure about Aifread&#39;s condition yet.</p>
<p>Eleanor proposes to Zaveid to join with the crew. <strong>No way.</strong> He doesn&#39;t want to hang around with killers.</p>
<p><strong>Zaveid:</strong> &quot;Sorry. I&#39;m a fighter, not a killer. I won&#39;t steal a single life. That&#39;s just <strong>my</strong> creed.&quot; I like his morals.</p>
<p>Eizen&#39;s not changing his &quot;creed&quot; either.</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s beginning to realize that malakhim have their own ways of living, &quot;just like humans.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Skit:</strong> Magilou points out Melchior cheats with his illusions.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;There&#39;s no cheating in combat.&quot;</p>
<p>It seems Melchior&#39;s not as holy or fair as he appears to be...</p>
<p>Plus, Rokurou was even fooled by his illusions.</p>
<p>Eleanor points out the benefits of Melchior&#39;s tricks.</p>
<p>Velvet snarks again at the Abbey&#39;s low methods: &quot;Oh, how humane. Wow, the Abbey is sooo great.&quot; Hee...</p>
<p>From Eleanor, I learn that Melchior worked for the Shepherd before the Abbey was founded. Hmmm...so Melchior&#39;s the &quot;mind of the Abbey,&quot; so to speak.</p>
<p>Velvet gets honest with her.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;<strong>Physical wounds can heal. Emotional wounds never fully fade.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou makes Eleanor feel a bit better.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Don&#39;t lose heart, Eleanor. Foul play is foul play, but you&#39;re talking to a daemon and a witch. Who can judge?&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor, as an exorcist, doesn&#39;t like a daemon trying to make her feel better.</p>

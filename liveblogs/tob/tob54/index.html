<p>Rokurou wonders where the herbalist is...</p>
<p>Eizen notes the corsair&#39;s scourge can be cured with &quot;sale&#39;tomah.&quot; </p>
<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> The &quot;sale&#39;tomah&quot; is another subtle <em>Tales</em> reference. Vg&#39;f npghnyyl gjb anzrf, Fnyru naq Gbuzn sebz <em>Gnyrf bs Erovegu</em>.</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s worried that corsair&#39;s scourge can be contagious. The disease can only be caught in the middle of the ocean, Magilou says, thinking it&#39;s the salt in the air or water.</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s also worried about &quot;sale&#39;tomah.&quot; Does she know the side effects of that flower? The flower tastes terrible, &quot;even [bringing] a daemon to the brink of tears...&quot;</p>
<p>We&#39;re at <strong>Port Reneed, the Waterside Village.</strong></p>
<p>I get another skit showing our progress on the expedition so far.</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s coming around to the idea about exploration...but she isn&#39;t. She gets another flashback...</p>
<p>Another <strong>skit:</strong> Magilou complains about Rokurou again, calling herself a &quot;delicate maiden.&quot;</p>
<p>Now she&#39;s thinking of putting Rokurou on a witch trial...</p>
<p>Laphicet giggles.</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s still wondering about what happened in the tunnels during Rokurou&#39;s duel with Shigure.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;I feel like I saw who he truly was, and it frightens me. But he and Lord Shigure are always trying to kill each other... I can&#39;t understand why he did what he did.&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen explains that it&#39;s probably got something to do with <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushido>his moral code</a> <strong>(TW: for mentions of death and suicide in link)</strong>: &quot;Be loyal to your lord, respect your elders, protect the weak, and act with honor.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor thinks he was trying to protect her? Hmmm...</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;He might have turned into a daemon but his memories and personality are still intact. I doubt his [morals] disappeared either.&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou overacts and says that he attacked Velvet immediately the first time they met. Yep. That&#39;s true. Same with what he almost did to Laphicet during his fight with Kurogane.</p>
<p>Velvet says that he just &quot;lives for his sword.&quot; Eleanor thinks he&#39;s still not that a bad guy. He&#39;s a &quot;problematic fave,&quot; at best, imo.</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s surprised at Eleanor&#39;s judgment of Rokurou.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s like...he&#39;s more sensitive to other people&#39;s emotions than he might seem to be at first glance.&quot;</p>
<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> I&#39;m guessing here that Rokurou might have been bullied by his older brother a lot when he was younger. Also, since he&#39;s the youngest sibling, that probably made him sort of sympathetic to others. If one adds in his adherence to his moral code, Rokurou&#39;s entire character sort of makes sense...</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s getting a bit irritated at her insight...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Up to the port we go, where I see a Katz.</p>
<p>Two fishermen think Titania&#39;s an experimentation ground, where the Abbey tests daemons...eeee....</p>
<p>Velvet considers their theory &quot;not a bad one.&quot;</p>
<p>The fishermen then laugh it off, thinking it might be pirates... they were so close to the answer...</p>
<p>No Abbey patrol ships were around Titania either after the prison break. Hmmm....</p>
<p>The young fishermen has &quot;a sixth sense&quot; when daemons are around...</p>
<p>The apothecary in Westgand&#39;s in the village west of the port, I&#39;m told.</p>
<p>In the storehouse a soldier and a woman are wondering why there are exorcists in <strong>Warg Forest</strong>. And why is the Shepherd himself ordering them to go there?</p>
<p>I learn from another soldier outside that the <em>Van Valvali</em> also &quot;donates supplies&quot;, or in Eizen&#39;s case, stores goods for a quick anchor.</p>
<p>So Burnack Plateau&#39;s north, and Warg Forest is east through the <strong>Fens of Nog</strong>...</p>
<p>While crossing the long bridge over to the village, Laphicet points out the bridge&#39;s &quot;interesting&quot; qualities.</p>
<p>Eizen delivers more history on Reneed as a port. Port Reneed was meant for smaller ships.</p>
<p>Eizen continues, saying the town made the port on the other side for larger ships and the bridge is what connects it. Plus, Aifread&#39;s crew secretly funded and stocked the resources for the whole construction!</p>
<p>Too bad the port got regulated by the Abbey again! It would have been prospering without the regulations...</p>
<p>Eizen gloats again that the crew could slip in and out unnoticed. Velvet points out his gloating thrice...</p>
<p>Into the village proper we go!</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Even with the rain pouring, it&#39;s a comfy place. <a href=https://youtu.be/9IULBS_sC7s>Here&#39;s the music for the village.</a></p>
<p>The Bloodwing agent looking at the lake has new jobs for us: a <strong>Trickstar</strong> and a <strong>Plantasm</strong> to go after.</p>
<p>Rumors are spreading about the High Priest&#39;s death. The girl thinks that&#39;s impossible...</p>
<p>Then the sailor exaggerates about the daemon&#39;s appearance, mentioning &quot;razor sharp horns and three burning eyes&quot;! Lol...</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;A horned giant with three eyes, huh? Velvet, you&#39;re one scary lady!&quot;</p>
<p>There&#39;s an orderly blocking the way to a house...the people get the official info about what happened to the High Priest.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;The Abbey&#39;s trying to cover it up, but the truth is getting out.&quot;</p>
<p>The orderly even says &quot;inconceivable&quot; to the rumors concerning the High Priest, mentioning the &quot;tip-top elite&quot; security of the palace.</p>
<p>The people are thinking about giant daemons in the capital. It must be Velvet&#39;s arm they&#39;re talking about.</p>
<p>The orderly mentions that &quot;panic and confusion are what the daemons want.&quot;</p>
<p>There are daemons under the Abbey&#39;s nose in this village.</p>
<p>There&#39;s chaos in the village despite the tranquility of the town...</p>
<p>I do more business at the local weapon shop here. My god I&quot;ve got a lot of Calcite Bracelets...</p>
<p>After that&#39;s done, I see a silver chest nearby, but I have to circle around two houses to get it. </p>
<p>There&#39;s also another guy there under a tree with a tengu mask!</p>
<p><a name=a></a></p>

<p></p><h2 class=entry-title>Tales of Berseria - Part 54a: Tales of Character Cards</h2><p></p>

<p>The tengu-masked boy calls himself &quot;Hidemi, third son and rising star of the Character Card family!&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s sort of like a memory minigame of sorts, but it&#39;s a bit more complex.</p>
<p>I decide to give it a go!</p>
<p>The characters for each card show all of the characters from almost every <em>Tales</em> series released in North America...the music for the minigame sounds familiar to me, for some reason.</p>
<p>I get 41 points from Round 2! So there&#39;s three rounds total...</p>
<p>I finish the last round, looks like I win!</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p></p><h2 class=entry-title>Tales of Berseria - Part 54: Pit Stop At Reneed (continued)</h2><p></p>

<p>I check out the inn, head outside, open the last chest here, and save!</p>
<p>The village is pretty small...</p>
<p>I see a Katz Box perched on top of a tall crate, freeing the Katz inside gets me a Shiba Inu Tail!</p>
<p>I now speak with the herbalist here for the sale&#39;tomah flowers.</p>
<p>But the herbalist doesn&#39;t have any...</p>
<p>Eizen gets a bit irascible at the herbalist since the sale&#39;tomah&#39;s in season.</p>
<p>But a daemon was spotted in the Warg Forest where the flowers are harvested! The Abbey&#39;s looking into it, but they haven&#39;t taken care of the daemon for some reason.</p>
<p>Eleanor asks why. The daemon&#39;s hard to catch, the herbalist says. And once they saw them, they didn&#39;t &quot;come back alive.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Never a dull moment with the Reaper&#39;s Curse, eh?&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor reacts to the &quot;Reaper&#39;s Curse&quot; line.</p>
<p>Velvet decides to go to Warg Forest directly.</p>
<p>Behind the two houses, a pioneer and his son are arguing whether to stay or go.</p>
<p>Bienfu makes another malapropism.</p>
<p>The pioneer&#39;s thinking about the long term via a thousand years.</p>
<p>Eleanor vows to end the daemonblight herself! She talks like a politician.</p>
<p>The rugged pioneer then asks Eleanor to marry his son! She&#39;s taken aback!</p>
<p>A woman&#39;s heard about the Warg Forest&#39;s daemon...she thinks it&#39;s invisible, or too fast or small to notice.</p>
<p>So the exorcists, as the woman tells us, are &quot;patrolling in shifts.&quot;</p>

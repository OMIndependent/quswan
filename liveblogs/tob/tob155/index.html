<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>It seems the populace is coming to from the Suppression...</p>
<p>One of the townspeople are still creeped out by what happened and &quot;hopes it never happens again.&quot;</p>
<p>A housewife mentions her child seeing &quot;a great dragon made of light.&quot; Innominat. The Abbey didn&#39;t give them an answer for the dragon.</p>
<p>The soldiers are telling the populace to keep calm.</p>
<p>Two people from Meirchio are still not happy about what we did to their town.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> (to herself) &quot;I&#39;m sorry...&quot;</p>
<p>They&#39;re still looking to their lord and savior the Shepherd for aid.</p>
<p>Another soldier&#39;s reassuring the citizens that Melchior and Shigure will save the day! I nun so much at this remark. But the citizens are now banding together to help.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Showtime, Majelu! Come out and face me, preferably unprepared!&quot;</p>
<p>The promoter tells us that Majelu&#39;s not doing shows at the moment.</p>
<p>Majelu ran away after she and Valta fought...oh dear...</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s in shock!</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;So? She&#39;s young, she probably just wants to go out and have...fun.&quot;</p>
<p>But, according to Valta, it takes three days to get back into tiptop shape after one day off...</p>
<p>Eleanor asks Valta if he&#39;s &quot;heard her out.&quot; She&#39;s in the <strong>Zamahl Grotto</strong>, but for what reason?</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;That place is a nest of vicious daemons!&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Hmmm... if Majelu really went there, then victory could end up being mine by default...&quot;</p>
<p>Oh my god, Magilou...</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;This isn&#39;t a joking matter! We have to find Majelu!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Valta:</strong> &quot;My precious Lulu...why would she go to a dangerous place?&quot;</p>
<p>We head for the grotto.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>All the Abbey guards are missing...</p>
<p>There&#39;s a floating witch daemon, and we hear Majelu screaming!</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;There&#39;s our little runaway!&quot;</p>
<p>What a giant daemon!</p>
<p>She&#39;s a <strong>Weighty Witch</strong>, and her broomstick has a lucky golden cat&#39;s head on the handle!</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Everyone&#39;s pinning their hopes on you, Majelu!&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Don&#39;t worry, Magilou&#39;s here to help!&quot;</p>
<p>As soon as we reduce her health, she makes a different cry, calling for more reinforcements!</p>
<p>But we take care of them, and we manage to get over a 100 hit combo on the boss!</p>
<p>We win a <strong>Dazing Glacite</strong>, and a <strong>Topaz Ribbon</strong> as our prizes!</p>
<p>Majelu thanks us!</p>
<p>Magilou asks if she ran away because of her teacher. She denies it, but Magilou understands...</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Teachers aren&#39;t good for much other than running their mouths and bossing people around.&quot; Oh my, Magilou.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;They just try to pick out your flaws. They don&#39;t see how hard their students work for them.&quot; She shakes her head.</p>
<p><strong>Majelu:</strong> &quot;Valta wouldn&#39;t even listen to me when I tried explaining why I wanted to come [to Zamahl Grotto]. All he cares about is dancing. He won&#39;t talk about anything else...&quot; Poor Majelu...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Magilou agrees, mentioning about her past a little bit. Then she advertises Magilou&#39;s Menagerie again.</p>
<p>Majelu has doubts though...a kindred spirit!</p>
<p>But Valta comes forth, limping!</p>
<p>Majelu came to find medicine for her teacher.</p>
<p>Eleanor tries to speak but Magilou stops her.</p>
<p><strong>Valta:</strong> &quot;Lulu, the only thing I care about anymore is seeing you become the greatest dancer in the world. I know it&#39;s selfish of me...Lulu, your dancing brings so much joy to people. And it&#39;s during a time when there isn&#39;t a lot of joy to go around.&quot;</p>
<p>Then Magilou comes in.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;No, no, no! Horrible! Terrible! Contrived!&quot; She calls Majelu unworthy of joining Magilou&#39;s Menagerie! Majelu&#39;s a bit puzzled...Magilou meant that it&#39;s not the time for a scene...</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Magikazam!&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou pulls out her doves and sparkling stars!</p>
<p><strong>Majelu:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s so pretty...&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Fear the might of Magilou, the greatest witch in 100 years! A third-rate dancer...can&#39;t even hope to compete with the likes of me. Stand in awe, student and teacher alike!&quot;</p>
<p>Now I know what she&#39;s doing!</p>
<p><strong>Majelu:</strong> &quot;I might not be able to compete at your level right now, but just you wait. One day, my dancing will beat you! Me and my teacher&#39;s dancing won&#39;t lose, even if it&#39;s to your magic!&quot;</p>
<p>Valta smiles.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Magilou&#39;s theme plays.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Oh really? Then it sounds like you and your teacher have lots of work ahead of you. But whenever you want to challenge Magilou&#39;s Menagerie, we&#39;ll be ready.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor thanks her for giving Majelu motivation.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Color me surprised.&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Well, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d say that...&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou mentions all of the bad scenarios that could happen between Valta and Majelu. Magilou&#39;s projecting her own past onto Majelu&#39;s situation...Eleanor&#39;s figuring it out.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;I&#39;ll say this much...It&#39;s human nature to end up wanting to stay with someone, if that person is someone who needs you.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Humans...are weak like that.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;But that&#39;s what also makes them human.&quot; And it&#39;s their greatest strength.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Ha ha, look at me. I don&#39;t even have a punchline for this one.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s a nice change of pace.&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Yes, but only on occasion!&quot;</p>
<p>Bienfu wonders about what they&#39;ll do for their act. Magilou says &quot;nothing.&quot; Poor Bienfu...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;There&#39;s your punchline.&quot;</p>
<p>End of sidequest.</p>
<p>I check around the grotto, and activate the geotree here...</p>
<p>Most of the daemons around here are Mt. Killaraus-level...</p>
<p>There&#39;s plenty of one-way creeks here too...</p>
<p>Also, plenty of Katz spirits here for the taking!</p>
<p>In one area, we see a crowd of Ghouls and Katz spirits!</p>
<p>We also grab some <strong>Ember Paper</strong> for Laphicet!</p>

<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>I go to the inn. A woman mentions &quot;Bunny Bonanza Saturday.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;I&#39;ve heard of this. You eat a hearty healthy meal of rabbit meat to help you get nice and strong.&quot; I don&#39;t eat rabbits. Rokurou is basically like Sokka when it comes to his meat diet. First sylphjays, then rabbits.</p>
<p>Phi&#39;s shocked!</p>
<p>The woman explains that on &quot;the night of the third Saturday of every month, lonely people go to sleep hugging a rabbit.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou got confused with Rappig Roundup Saturday. The woman explains that Saturday.</p>
<p>Phi now pities the rappigs...</p>
<p>A pirate sitting on the sofa mentions a rumor about Vortigern. It was raided. By one daemon!?</p>
<p><strong>Pirate:</strong> &quot;He called himself <strong>Lancelot du Capalus</strong> and challenged one exorcist in particular to come try and fight him.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s Count Capalus&#39;s first name.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet recalls the rumors back in Port Reneed...</p>
<p>Rokurou asks if the exorcist Lancelot wanted to challenge was Shigure. The pirate confirms it.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s the real Count. The Count is a prideful man. But when the Abbey stole his political power...his own former servant, Shigure, rose to legate, and suddenly outranked him.&quot; Wow...</p>
<p>So Rokurou&#39;s family served under the Capalus clan...</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;[...] <strong>if the Capaluses were the royal family&#39;s hidden dagger, the Rangetsu clan was its blade.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen&#39;s thinking of allying Lancelot to their cause. Rokurou doubts it. He thinks Lancelot&#39;s probably too far gone...</p>
<p>We go to Reneed and go to Videl to give him the third ingredient.</p>
<p>He&#39;s not sitting on the bench.</p>
<p>I get more treasures here and go to Hidemi to get more fashion accessories.</p>
<p>Next, I take the long way to Vortigern, but I make a detour to Lothengrin...</p>
<p>I see a Katz there, along with new treasure: <strong>Spiked Shoes!</strong></p>
<p>I talk to the Katz and play more Flag Fetcher, and realize what those stray wings does. If I press X, it gives me a speed boost!</p>
<p>After a few rounds of that, it&#39;s off to Vortigern...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The place is empty save for monsters at the front gate. I save before heading up to the Eastern Gate...</p>
<p>The giant gates are still open...</p>
<p>Here&#39;s Lancelot!</p>
<p><strong>Lancelot:</strong> &quot;I see you&#39;ve come, Shigure.&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Count Capalus. It&#39;s been a long time.&quot; He kneels before his lord.</p>
<p>Count Capalus recognizes Rokurou. He tells him to leave.</p>
<p><strong>Lancelot:</strong> &quot;I want your brother, the traitor Shigure.&quot; So the heads of the Abbey&#39;s filled with traitors, huh? So Velvet&#39;s not the only one wanting revenge...</p>
<p>Rokurou tells him that he is the one that will take care of Shigure, telling him he was assigned with that task.</p>
<p>Lancelot brushes him aside, reminding him of his failure to stop Shigure last time. So Lancelot&#39;s the one that ordered Rokurou to be locked up in Titania...</p>
<p>Rokurou winces a bit at the insult Lancelot called him.</p>
<p><strong>Lancelot:</strong> &quot;Frankly, I don&#39;t need any Rangetsu to do my bidding any longer. Not with the power I&#39;ve attained by devouring everyone in the entire manor...&quot; Oh my god...</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Welp, it looks like the only thing that got abducted was this guy&#39;s conscience.&quot;<br>
<strong>Lancelot:</strong> &quot;Remain there, Rokurou! Your lord commands you!&quot;</p>
<p>So he&#39;s going to take care of Rokurou. </p>
<p>Eizen approaches, but Rokurou tells him to wait.</p>
<p>Phi asks what he&#39;s doing, but Rokurou gets up and steadfastly refuses. He pulls out his daggers.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;...Dying to you would make a mockery of the Rangetsu name. Turn your blade on me or my brother, and we won&#39;t hold back. Not even against an impotent lord.&quot; Ooooohhhh!</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The fight is on!</p>
<p>What a tough fight, since he keeps defending a lot, and his Light Spear attack...oh my god...</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I know you were hoping to negotiate an alliance.&quot;<br>
<strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;Don&#39;t worry. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s someone we could fight alongside.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Come on, Rokurou. You wanted to kill him from the very start, didn&#39;t you?&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;No. Well, maybe a little.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;You&#39;re a scary guy when push comes to shove. Whatever happened to honoring your ancestral debt?&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou denies being hypocritical, as he made that vow to Count Capalus back when he was human. Now that he&#39;s a daemon, he could forfeit that...</p>
<p>He still owes his debt to Velvet since he made that vow after his malevolent transformation.</p>
<p>Eleanor asks Rokurou about what Count Capalus said about Shigure.</p>
<p>Rokurou will not tolerate anyone who mocks his family&#39;s best qualities...but he waves it away as &quot;nonsense&quot; as being similar to Count Capalus.</p>
<p>Eleanor disagrees with him on that being &quot;nonsense.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;There are just some things a person can&#39;t surrender.&quot;</p>
<p>With that, I get my reward from a Bloodwing Agent back at Reneed, and I&#39;m done for tonight!</p>

<p>Well, it looks like we&#39;re not sailing away to Midgand...booo!</p>
<p>The guild&#39;s hiding behind the rocks before the city gate. They tell us they&#39;re holding an execution for &quot;a witch who [let] daemons into the city.&quot; Magilou...</p>
<p>The guild knows Teresa&#39;s tricks. By baiting one criminal, the others come out, they say. Velvet&#39;s not pleased at being called a criminal by illegal smugglers. That&#39;s why the guild master warned them to stay away from the city.</p>
<p>Rokurou knows it&#39;s Magilou who&#39;s being tried for execution...and the party&#39;s out of options at this point, but Velvet has another plan. They&#39;re going to steal a ship...this is getting interesting...</p>
<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> I&#39;ve never watched <strong>Leverage</strong>, but is this how heists in that show play out in the start of every episode?</p>
<p>Velvet thinks of going back to Dyle to help them. Rokurou&#39;s worried about Magilou. Velvet decides that Magilou&#39;s life is in the Abbey&#39;s hands.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Sorry, Magilou. RIP.&quot;</p>
<p>Knowing Teresa, however, I think this might be a trap as well. She might know that we&#39;ll head into the Hollow. Probably Eleanor might&#39;ve told her about the Hollow...</p>
<p>But, we have no other choice...</p>
<p>We fight a few battles first.</p>
<p>I activate another <strong>skit:</strong> Rokurou points out Velvet&#39;s using everything and everyone as part of her revenge, even &quot;abandoning&quot; Magilou.</p>
<p>Velvet knows she can take care of herself. Plus, she knows that Magilou&#39;s told Teresa everything about them. That&#39;s why they&#39;re going to Dyle...</p>
<p>One more <strong>skit:</strong> Rokurou&#39;s sharpening blades. He asks Velvet if her weapons need sharpening.</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s reciting her old lessons again. She&#39;s not happy about doing that...</p>
<p>Rokurou reminds her after she&#39;s done, she should &quot;rub [the blades] with clove oil, and wipe them down [with] wool.&quot;</p>
<p>Even her &quot;old teacher&quot; said that as well...it always goes back to him... </p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I take the long way to the tar lake.</p>
<p>I&#39;m there now, where Velvet gives the go-ahead for Dyle&#39;s raid.</p>
<p>Dyle calls her &quot;presumptuous,&quot; Velvet says she&#39;s a daemon.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;It comes with the territory.&quot;</p>
<p>Dyle laughs heartily at her answer.</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s planning something here...</p>
<p>The secret way by the storehouse is out, so the only way to go would be by the front, as a distraction. So Dyle helps by &quot;securing&quot; the ship from the storehouse entrance when all of the guards are focused on Velvet&#39;s team.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the two groups meet and the ship starts sailing, with Dyle helming.</p>
<p>Velvet makes the charge to take the front.</p>
<p>The plan starts tomorrow.</p>
<p>Dyle tells the party to make themselves at home... </p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Someone speaks to Velvet. It&#39;s Laphicet. He asks if she was having a nightmare. She smiles and hugs him. I don&#39;t like where this is going...</p>
<p>Laphicet tells her he has something important to do, at the Shrine of Tranquility. Oh no.</p>
<p>Laphicet walks away...Velvet&#39;s now bound by the same fiery cuffs again...</p>
<p>Velvet wakes!</p>
<p>Rokurou even notices her restlessness.</p>
<p>Velvet tells Rokurou he can back out if he wants. Rokurou&#39;s not having that, as he still has his debt he has to pay to her.</p>
<p>Velvet calls his rules &quot;odd.&quot; Rokurou says it&#39;s &quot;[him] as just [him].&quot; It&#39;s normal for Rokurou.</p>
<p>I get another big pic of his confident, smiling face. Awwww... <img class=emojione alt=ðŸ™‚ title=:slight_smile: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/1f642.png> </p>

<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> I took this screencap from another playthrough video online.</p>
<p>Rokurou asks who Artorius is. I forgot Rokurou was in prison around the same time Velvet was.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;My target. He killed my brother.&quot; </p>

<p>Now for our final job!</p>
<p>The woman in black&#39;s looking at the fine alcohol collection on the left side of the tavern. She&#39;s impressed. She&#39;s seen nothing yet.</p>
<p>Our final task is to destroy a bunch of stuff inside red crates in a warehouse in the port. There must be some contraband lying inside those crates...</p>
<p>Eizen has the <em>Van Eltia</em> draw guards away from the warehouse...</p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s curious about what&#39;s in the red crates too.</p>
<p>I save at the city square before heading out.</p>
<p>I&#39;m betting finding that scholar was the longest task we had to do. Lucky I did that one first!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I sort of spoiled myself a bit before getting to this part: there&#39;s a boss battle in this job and it&#39;s going to be against someone very familiar...</p>
<p>The guards are now talking about doing everything they can for the Shepherd.</p>
<p>Everyone&#39;s talking about the Shepherd at the port, and a new age of peace...</p>
<p>I enhance and dismantle more stuff again...the weapon shop in the port has the same surname as the protagonist (Qhanzvf) from another <em>Tales</em> game.</p>
<p>We have too many Amber equipment...</p>
<p>After that business, we head for the docks.</p>
<p>I find some Bread Crumbs near a shipment of crates.</p>
<p>We see a nearby Bloodwing Agent, who gives us our reward for beating Orc Kong, the code red daemon in the highway...</p>
<p>One of the guards at the north gate tells us the road is closed because of construction of the new Abbey temple. Hopefully, we&#39;ll get to see it...</p>
<p>One townsperson tells her friends that she&#39;s been praying for safe construction of the Empyrean&#39;s Throne up north, where the unfinished temple is, after hearing the Shepherd&#39;s speech...</p>
<p>We make it to where the warehouse is.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Alright, the guards are gone. Let&#39;s move in.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Benwick and the crew did a find job.&quot;</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We talk to a guy near the docks with Peek-a-Bangs, who tells us the Abbey&#39;s building a new base, and thinks it&#39;s a waste of money building a new temple. Instead, it should be used for more daemon hunting.</p>
<p>Velvet questions him if he&#39;s sure that he should say things like that around the city. He&#39;s not swayed by the Shepherd&#39;s speech. This is a smart person right here.</p>
<p>He adds that there&#39;s no cure for daemonblight, and there are still more daemons lurking around. He even mentions that daemons might have infiltrated the capital while no one&#39;s watching.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Yep, you&#39;re completely right.&quot; That guy is clever.</p>
<p>Warehouse, here we come!</p>
<p>After opening the chest here, I have Velvet go to the huge pile of red crates we need to destroy in the corner...</p>
<p>The crates have the Midgand Cathedral seal on it.</p>
<p>Eizen asks for a peek inside. No chance.</p>
<p>Velvet asks Laphicet to burn the crates.</p>
<p>Looks like that&#39;s done...</p>
<p>Outside, <strong>that exorcist</strong> is here! Oh no...</p>
<p>She&#39;s now planning to get an audience with the Shepherd asap about Hellawes.</p>
<p>And she spots them!</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Velvet continues taunting her.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> (corrects Velvet) &quot;<strong>Eleanor Hume, exorcist praetor.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>She summons two Duelist malakhim.</p>
<p>The fight is on!</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;You won&#39;t get away this time!&quot;
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;You really want a fight, don&#39;t you?&quot;</p>
<p>I have Rokurou take care of the two malakhim...</p>
<p>Now that they&#39;re gone, I switch my artes on the menu, based on the exorcist&#39;s weaknesses!</p>
<p>Her twirling staff can also paralyze the party!</p>
<p>I draw her focus to Rokurou, while Laphicet casts more spells at her!</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Willing to fight without your malakhim?&quot;</p>
<p>The exorcist looks at the warehouse...</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;<strong>No!</strong> You set the storehouse ablaze?! The people have worked so hard to withstand this time of crisis...How can you destroy what they have so painstakingly built?!&quot;</p>
<p>Because she can, I say.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>Because I&#39;m not human.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>The exorcist is about to summon another malak...</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s prepped for more...</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Oh boy, it&#39;s a mascot character: a small, purple malak with a top hat with big oval holes cut above the brim for his eyes!</p>
<p>Laphicet calls him &quot;adorable.&quot; But, knowing from <strong>Secret of Mana</strong>, it&#39;s usually the cute ones that are dangerous...</p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;<strong>Ooooh, I&#39;ve found you at last!</strong>&quot;
<strong>Mascot:</strong> &quot;That bad-bad voice!&quot;</p>
<p><strong><strong>Magilou:</strong></strong> &quot;Bienfu, you traitor!? You&#39;ll never leave my clutches again!&quot;</p>
<p>Yes, run, Bienfu, run!</p>
<p>Magilou jumps off the bow of the ship!</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s not happy Bienfu ran away.</p>
<p>Other citizens are now seeing the fire.</p>
<p>Velvet and crew walk off.</p>
<p>Rokurou carries Magilou with him!</p>
<p><strong><strong>Magilou:</strong></strong> &quot;...Witchnappers!&quot; Hee...</p>
<p>The people now come to the exorcist&#39;s aid. She tells them to put out the fire in the warehouse.</p>
<p>Eleanor asks a citizen what was in there. Nectar...oh my god...</p>
<p>She asks why the crew would want to destroy Nectar...if Eleanor knew about the addictive qualities of Nectar...</p>
<p>I get an <strong>Intermediate Ignicite</strong> for winning!</p>
<p>I now get pointers on status ailments and dropped items.</p>
<p><a name=6></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Magilou cries, robbed of the opportunity to get her revenge on Bienfu the mascot!</p>
<p>Laphicet whispers to Magilou about Bienfu. Now she &quot;knows where to find him!&quot;</p>
<p>So the malak Bienfu is her target.</p>
<p>Magilou exaggerates yet again.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Magilou:</strong></strong> &quot;A Creature of Unfathomable Wickedness and Beguiling Cuteness who broke the heart of this wretched maiden!&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou and Laphicet don&#39;t get why she wants revenge on such a malak...</p>
<p><strong>Another skit:</strong> Rokurou announces we&#39;ve done everything on the list. Laphicet&#39;s stomach rumbles. More mabo curry for him!</p>
<p>I&#39;m reminded again that Velvet can&#39;t taste anything, she&#39;s not too comfortable about that. Rokurou tells Laphicet about that issue.</p>
<p><strong>One more skit:</strong> Laphicet asks Rokurou if he feels &quot;useful&quot; to the crew. He points out everyone&#39;s strengths, and he points out his own flaws: &quot;not good at fighting,&quot; and his gloominess...</p>
<p>Eizen cheers him up by saying &quot;offense alone isn&#39;t everything.&quot; He tells Laphicet his healing artes are what keep the crew going.</p>
<p>Velvet puts down Magilou again, while saying Laphicet is useful. Oh my god...</p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s not too comfortable about being compared to Magilou. Velvet corrects herself. Eizen says &quot;patience.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;You&#39;ve only been set free. That you&#39;ve managed to keep up with us this far is a feat in and of itself.&quot;</p>
<p>He tells him to &quot;keep [his] spirits up, and keep working at it, and [he&#39;ll] get there before [he knows] it.&quot; Awww...</p>
<p>I save and fight some more.</p>
<p><a name=7></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Expedition crew returns, and we get a Pirate Flag!</p>
<p>I read the synopsis on the way back. Eleanor&#39;s complaining under her breath as to why she was assigned Bienfu as a malak, Rokurou complimenting the &quot;sense of style&quot; the red-scarved daemons had...</p>
<p>I build up the party&#39;s cooking skills...and Rokurou&#39;s the first character to have his cooking leveled up!</p>
<p>In one battle, we face some Snakes, and we finish them off like usual...</p>
<p>...but why am I not being transitioned to the victory scene?</p>
<p>I realize why quickly: I get my first <strong>Dire Foe,</strong> a <strong>Sacred Baboon!</strong></p>
<p>I finally finish off this tough foe after tons of time!</p>
<p>I get a <strong>Pioneering Ignicite</strong>, and a Silver Scrap as new items!</p>
<p>The game tells me more about what a Dire Foe does: they attack less when their HP is high, and that I can escape from them anytime!</p>
<p>Now we head back to town...</p>
<p><a name=8></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Skit:</strong> Eizen asks about Eleanor the exorcist. Rokurou explains her teary-eyed introduction back at Beardsley.</p>
<p>Eizen&#39;s gaping in shock at the idea of an exorcist crying...she cried because she doesn&#39;t agree with the Shepherd&#39;s philosophy of sacrifice. Velvet calls her &quot;naive.&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen doesn&#39;t think so. He calls her strong for still doing her job anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;It sounds like that they don&#39;t hand out the rank of praetor to just anyone [...] just stay sharp around her. That&#39;s all.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou asks Eizen if Bienfu is a malak. He is. Rokurou also deduces that Magilou is or used to be an exorcist, and asks why she calls herself a witch.</p>
<p>She must have done something the Abbey wasn&#39;t happy about that caused her to get thrown in Titania...</p>
<p>Eizen thinks she might be a fraud. I&#39;m still guessing she&#39;s a spy for the Abbey.</p>
<p>Lol...Rokurou does a very good impression of Bienfu: &quot;<strong>I will protect you, Madam Eleanor! Face me now, daemon!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet laughs. Rokurou notices. Laphicet aplogizes. Rokurou points out there&#39;s nothing wrong with laughing, and does one more Bienfu impression.</p>
<p>Rokurou has Laphicet do one too. Velvet tells them to &quot;knock it off&quot; in a sharp tone.</p>
<p>She mentions people are staring...</p>
<p>Oh my god, that was such a funny skit! I think I remember saying before that Rokurou is this game&#39;s Lhev (ciphered name) and I&#39;m probably right!</p>

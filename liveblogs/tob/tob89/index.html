<p>Laphicet asks Eleanor about exorcists not praying to their malakhim. Eleanor&#39;s pondering, asking about oaths.</p>
<p>Laphicet explains what Eizen told him about &quot;prayers and blessings.&quot; This is the first time Eleanor&#39;s heard of such an idea.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;I used to think the same way as the other exorcists—-<strong>malakhim are merely tools that allow us [to cast] artes...but Innominat is different. The exorcists all worship him. They have faith in his mighty power. And [...] the people of this nation pray to the Empyrean for salvation...just as [the Shepherd] instructs them.</strong>&quot; So only the Shepherd&#39;s been getting power now...</p>
<p>Laphicet realizes something too. By keeping other malakhim weak and prayerless, the Shepherd and his bond to Innominat is the only one that gets stronger.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;[The Shepherd] founded the Abbey within the existing church...<strong>so that he could direct the people&#39;s thoughts toward Innominat.</strong>&quot; Why didn&#39;t Eizen tell everyone about prayers and thoughts sooner!?</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;<strong>So that even while they lionize him as their savior, they are made aware of Innominat&#39;s presence behind him.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Phi gives most of the facts so far.</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;Everyone starts [worshipping] Innominat...the prayers of the [people] go to him...becoming his power...&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;After the [...] decline of Empyrean worship, he becomes stronger than anyone today could imagine.&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;The pieces do fit. Oaths, prayers, blessings, daemonblight... so much in this world is affected by matters of the heart.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;<strong>We are truly going up against the rest of the entire world, aren&#39;t we?</strong>&quot; Intimidating, huh?</p>
<p>Phi smiles and tells Eleanor to have faith in him.</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;I&#39;m going to do my best to get stronger, so believe in me. I am a malak, after all.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Oh, Laphicet... you&#39;ve become so brave, so quickly.&quot; Awww...</p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s blushing. Eleanor points out his cuteness. She walks away, and Velvet asks why Phi&#39;s blushing.</p>
<p><strong>Another skit:</strong> There&#39;s Eizen wearing his famous glasses, reading a letter.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/w7i6LTa.png alt="eizen glasses" width=480 height=270 id=hd-liveblog></p>
<p>Phi asks him about the feeling of receiving a letter.</p>
<p>Eizen says &quot;there&#39;s no joy in receiving [letters].&quot;</p>
<p>Phi&#39;s lonely. He has no people to give or to send letters to.</p>
<p>Then Eleanor comes in and has a letter for Phi. He jumps! It&#39;s from Bienfu! It&#39;s to make Phi happy. Surprised, Phi thanks him.</p>
<p>Then Bienfu reads his own letter to Phi.</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;Ah, there&#39;s the Bienfu we know and love.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor points out it&#39;s just Bienfu talking about himself.</p>
<p>Phi smiles and thanks him anyway.</p>

<hr>
<p>Outside, we talk to the Peek-a-Bangs pirate, who tells us the fisherman&#39;s guild at Hellawes can give us cover as a relief ship.</p>
<p>So they&#39;ve stocked the ship with supplies for the Hellawes fishing guild: bait, twelve-year -old Amber Draught...they knew about that stuff thanks to Dyle. They&#39;re watching him carefully just in case he takes another sip...</p>
<p>The pirate owes Dyle a lot.</p>
<p>Benwick tells us everything&#39;s ready.</p>
<p>Dyle, the Prince, and Kamoana see them off. Kamoana comes up to Eleanor, crying. She mentions her nightmare about her mother, who called her &quot;scary&quot;... <img class=emojione alt=☹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Poor Kamoana... <img class=emojione alt=☹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Eleanor consoles her.</p>
<p>Kamoana&#39;s smart enough to see through Eleanor&#39;s &quot;lie.&quot;</p>
<p>Kamoana cries more...</p>
<p>Laphicet tries to calm Kamoana down. Even Eleanor&#39;s almost on the verge of tears.</p>
<p>Irritated, Velvet goes to her and hugs her.</p>
<p>Kamoana yells out, hating Velvet.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s right. Let it all out.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh god...that scene was too intense to watch...poor, poor Kamoana...</p>
<p>So Kamoana cried herself to sleep. Velvet mentions her brother crying like that on occasion.</p>
<p>Eleanor tells Dyle and Prince Percival to watch over Kamoana.</p>
<p>Prince Percival promises to do what he can. </p>
<p>He complains about it a bit, preferring politicians, but at least he&#39;s watching over someone who is honest.</p>
<p>Dyle mentions that a lizard daemon and a prince can&#39;t replace a mother...</p>

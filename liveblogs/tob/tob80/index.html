<p>The <em>Van Eltia</em>&#39;s still undergoing maintenance for now...</p>
<p>Kurogane&#39;s not letting one single gram of orichalcum be spared to make Rokurou&#39;s sword.</p>
<p>Rokurou asks Velvet if Kurogane could use the orichalcum for the blades. Velvet don&#39;t care, but he&#39;s polite to ask. Good for you, Rokurou.</p>
<p>Velvet doubts Kurogane would make a weapon, even Kurogane agrees, citing convention.</p>
<p><strong>Kurogane:</strong> &quot;But when has convention ever stopped a daemon? We&#39;re dealing with the hardest metal in existence. But I&#39;m ready to cast aside all doubt...to focus everything on forging my greatest creation.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou and Velvet wish him good luck on forging that blade.</p>
<p>Bienfu asks Velvet to give him a nickname.</p>
<p>Magilou asks if Velvet&#39;s &quot;practicing her dove impression.&quot; Oh boy...</p>
<p>Magilou asks what would happen if they were stopped again. Velvet decides to pull another &quot;trick!&quot; Magilou offers to teach her magic tricks for 10,000!</p>
<p>Magilou does bring good advice.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;You have to perfect your art whether it be juggling or vengeance...&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s trying to figure out most of which of the earthpulse points in the world have a therions in them.</p>
<p>She&#39;s deducing...</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;If you&#39;re going to do somethig then give it your all. There is no other way to live!&quot;</p>
<p>She&#39;s doing this for Laphicet and her. She wants to know the truth. She says that &quot;I&#39;m not doing this for you&quot; line in a way that any bad-guy-turned-good in another show could relate to.</p>
<p>Velvet understands why Laphicet&#39;s helping her out so much...but, she needs to show her appreciation more, says Eleanor.</p>
<p>Laphicet and Kamoana are talking. Kamoana wants to play I Spy with Phi...they do so. Kamoana spies with her little eye, a V! Velvet...</p>
<p>Kamoana cries...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Poor Phi...&quot;</p>
<p>Kamoana&#39;s still angry that Laphicet won her I Spy game so easily...she does look up to Prince Percival as &quot;a wise being.&quot;</p>
<p>Percival just read something about men somewhere in a novel. He is a bit like Estelle.</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s wearing Horns while Phi&#39;s wearing an Angel Halo...</p>
<p>The pirates want to make sweets for Kamoana...</p>
<p>Velvet smiles at Phi. Awwww...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Hey, what do you say we track down another therion?&quot;<br>
<strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;Sure. From what I can tell, the next closest earthpulse is near the center of Midgand.&quot;</p>
<p>Back to the belly of the beast...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Velvet&#39;s thinking about the condition of the capital now that Griffin&#39;s out of the villa...</p>
<p>Rokurou thinks going there&#39;s the better option.</p>
<p>Eleanor says Eizen hasn&#39;t showed up...</p>
<p>Where is he?</p>
<p>Rokurou sees a letter on the ground and reads it...Oh boy...Rokurou, you snoop.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet</strong> points that out: &quot;It&#39;s rude to read other people&#39;s letters.&quot;</p>
<p>But who does the letter belong to? And who is it being sent to?</p>
<p>Laphicet reads the sender. It&#39;s not a common name, it looks like a ciphered name...</p>
<p>Velvet guesses they must have been on the island.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Hey! Anybody lose a letter?&quot; I like the way she said that line.</p>
<p>We now look for the letter writer...</p>
<p>At the docks, there&#39;s Eizen!</p>
<p>He&#39;s asking if a girl, or a woman, is okay...the White Turtlez says she&#39;s okay...</p>
<p>He now offers Eizen a sunflower print to wrap the pot with. Eizen takes it. It&#39;s &quot;cute.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s gaping in surprise at what he just heard.</p>
<p>Eizen sees them!</p>
<p>Velvet asks if someone dropped a letter...</p>
<p>...and someone whooshes it away at full speed!</p>
<p>Everyone&#39;s gaping in surprise. Don&#39;t laugh, guys!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ZNEFxpO.png alt=surprise width=480 height=270 id=hd-liveblog></p>
<p>Rokurou lies right to the reaper&#39;s face...a bit.</p>
<p>The extreme close-ups on this skit...oh my god...</p>
<p>Oh boy. The tension is rising.</p>
<p>He sends the letter with the pot...</p>
<p>Velvet tells him about their mission. Everyone leaves but Rokurou and Laphicet, wondering who he was sending a gift to...</p>
<p>Laphicet and Rokurou compliment the &quot;ol&#39; Reeps&#39;&quot; penmanship.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;<strong>I can hear you two, you know!?</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Holy heck...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Skit:</strong> Magilou wonders about Velvet giving Laphicet a nickname, which Magilou says as a &quot;token effort,&quot; wondering that &quot;maybe [she was] trying to encourage him to be his own being.&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou points out that Velvet made malak!Laphicet into his own person...it&#39;s a bit heartwarming.</p>
<p>Magilou asks Velvet for a nickname. Velvet mentions that &quot;she just forced&quot; herself in the crew. Magilou <strong>begs</strong> for one, though...yikes.</p>
<p>Velvet calls her &quot;Magi.&#39; Magilou&#39;s not satisfied.</p>
<p>The whole scene ends up with Velvet calling her: &quot;Witchy McWitcherton.&quot; If Yuri was part of the crew, he&#39;d think of a good one for Magilou...</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;A nickname needs to have charm. It needs to have a lasting impression.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet starts calling her &quot;Hatty,&quot; &quot;Bookskirt,&quot; &quot;Ms. Creepy Eyes.&quot; Velvet&#39;s enjoying this...</p>
<p>And Velvet ends up with one that&#39;s true of Magilou&#39;s personality, but too long to name...</p>
<p><strong>Next skit:</strong> The octopuses that the crew slew, still alive, are now being made into food for Kamoana. Eeee...</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;A therion needs malevolence to survive.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Eizen</strong> mentions the menu for Kamoana: &quot;Octopus ink pasta with takoyaki and fried octopus on the side, and Hellawesian octopus carpaccio.&quot;</p>
<p>Kurogane made a takoyaki pan too!</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s warmly smiling at the idea of octopus ink pasta...</p>
<p>Laphicet explains the differences between squid ink and octopus ink.</p>
<p>Velvet calls back to her brother Laphi, saying &quot;octopus ink pasta doesn&#39;t taste very good.&quot;</p>
<p>Phi offers to eat some octopus ink pasta.</p>
<p>Percival calls his hawk Grawky, and asks him to find &quot;something nice&quot; for Kamoana.</p>
<p><strong>Next skit:</strong> Rokurou wonders about Eizen&#39;s gift.</p>
<p>Laphicet doesn&#39;t want to think about messing with Batman pirate malak again...poor Phi...</p>
<p>Rokurou thinks Eizen&#39;s writing to a girlfriend...</p>
<p>The subtitles mention a pot, but Rokurou says &quot;cooking pot.&quot;</p>
<p>Phi guesses the girl Eizen&#39;s sending the present to must be the &quot;girl with the yellow umbrella.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou teases Phi. Stop that, Rokurou. </p>
<p>Eleanor and Magilou come in.</p>
<p>Phi mentions the sunflower print wrap reminds him of the yellow umbrella girl...</p>
<p>Velvet comes in, glad that &quot;Eizen has someone to write to.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou points out Velvet eavesdropping. She blushes.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Fourth skit:</strong> Eleanor asks about Eizen, his tastes, and his everyday habits.</p>
<p>Magilou mentions Eizen&#39;s habits: eating curry every weekend. Mmmm...Curry...</p>
<p>And he wants his pasta cooked a certain way...and he has the same outfit done for him. Same size, same color.</p>
<p>Velvet calls him &quot;a pain&quot;.</p>
<p>Eleanor likes that &quot;meticulous&quot; side of Eizen.</p>
<p>More skits to go. I hope this is the last one...</p>
<p>Eizen flips his coin. It lands on tails again! Rokurou and Laphicet want to see Eizen land his coin on heads.</p>
<p>Rokurou decides to bring in &quot;something special.&quot; A coin with two heads!</p>
<p>Eleanor calls it cheating. </p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s effort and hard work.&quot;</p>
<p>He flips the coin. Then the crow flies off with it! Eizen can&#39;t win no matter what. Poor Eizen...</p>
<p>Rokurou brings up another backup coin...</p>
<p>Whoa, what!? Eleanor points out Griffin&#39;s taken the coin with him...</p>
<p>Does Rokurou have a third two-headed coin?</p>
<p>This is too funny...</p>
<p>He does have a backup!</p>
<p>Eizen flips that coin: the coin broke!</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;You gotta be kidding me! Does [the Reaper&#39;s Curse] have to go this far over a damn coin?&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen&#39;s resigned to his fate.</p>
<p>Grim&#39;s looking out at the docks...</p>
<p>She asks Eizen why he lives at sea &quot;since he&#39;s an earth malak...&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;I live on the sea <strong>because</strong> I&#39;m an earth malak.&quot; So in a metaphorical way, he&#39;s the land moving on the sea...</p>
<p>Eizen tells a story about Aifread laughing at &quot;the idea of a pirate who couldn&#39;t swim.&quot; Poor Eizen...</p>
<p>Then he started &quot;tough training&quot; to destroy that weakness...</p>
<p>Then he mentions all that tough training, starting at a lake, then a river, and at an ocean. The waters weren&#39;t so kind to him...</p>
<p><strong>Grimoirh:</strong> &quot;The Reaper&#39;s Curse at play...?&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen mentions his hard work and determination to ensure that his elemental affinity and curse didn&#39;t stop him...</p>
<p>Grim asks if he <strong>did</strong> learn how to swim...he did... but he still needs his life preserver.</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Benwick asks about Griffin&#39;s hunts. The hawk&#39;s bringing in enormous fish now, especially swordfish! The hawk drops it on the ship!</p>
<p>Laphicet mentions the Prince&#39;s happiness when Grawky flies free...</p>
<p>So Kamoana thought of Griffin&#39;s nickname: Grawky.</p>
<p>Eizen points out the freedom that the Prince is experiencing for the first time in his life.</p>
<p>Magilou points out that Griffin&#39;s got an &quot;elephant tuna!&quot; Oh my god...is she exaggerating?</p>
<p>Elephant tuna can sell up to <strong>20 million gald!?</strong></p>
<p>Benwick&#39;s eyes light up at the money. Eizen&#39;s not happy though, as the elephant tuna&#39;s about to damage the <em>Van Eltia</em>!</p>
<p>Eizen and Benwick run to stop Griffin from dropping the tuna! Lol...</p>
<p>Cut to black. It seems Griffin dropped the tuna into the sea...</p>
<p>I go inside, where everyone has something new to say.</p>
<p>Magilou (or Kamoana?) wants to play a game of I Spy...Velvet can&#39;t see what she&#39;s spying this time.</p>
<p>Rokurou asks Eizen about the girl with the yellow umbrella. He&#39;s getting nowhere.</p>
<p>Prince Percival&#39;s still in trouble for what Griffin did on the ship...</p>
<p>...and this ends tonight&#39;s session!</p>

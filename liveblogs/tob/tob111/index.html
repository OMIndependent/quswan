<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>Another dream, she looks at the faces of the late Oscar Dragonis and Teresa Linares.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;...They&#39;re dead. No...<strong>I killed them.</strong> I&#39;m the same as the Shepherd...&quot;</p>
<p>Celica and Laphi await behind her.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;I killed her brother before her very eyes...&quot;</p>
<p>This is a lot to take in...</p>
<p><strong>Laphi:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s not the same...&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>It is...!</strong> But I didn&#39;t have any choice! <strong>It was the only way to avenge you! It was all for you! I did it for you!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>She shakes him. He falls. Her therion arm&#39;s out.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>I didn&#39;t want this.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>She cries. Now comes the Shepherd alongside Celica.</p>
<p><strong>Celica:</strong> &quot;There&#39;s nowhere left to run.&quot;<br>
<strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;Nowhere for you, or for me...&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet gets up.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Nowhere left.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou asks if she&#39;s alright.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;I ate too much. That&#39;s all.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;They...they were close. They supported each other ever since they were children.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;I just did to them what they were going to do to us.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;<strong>And who will killing them save?</strong>&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>The soul of my murdered brother.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou now states the Abbey&#39;s probably going to create a new therion.</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s internally justifying the murders of Oscar and Teresa.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Another <strong>skit:</strong> Magilou&#39;s somber at the events that happened...</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;We never expected that Teresa would be a therion either.&quot;<br>
<strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;Velvet and...Teresa weren&#39;t so different. They both loved their brothers.&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Not everyone loves their brothers.&quot; Yeah, Rokurou, we know about your case.</p>
<p>Now our next move is to find another therion, says Magilou.</p>
<p>Phi points out the difficulty of doing that. Rokurou also thinks that by doing so, it&#39;s going to delay or stop the Abbey&#39;s plans to summon Innominat.</p>
<p>Eizen considers this moment an opportunity to attack the Abbey.</p>
<p>So much speculation on whether there&#39;s going to be a new therion or not...</p>
<p>Phi also thinks that Velvet needs to rest.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;If we&#39;re going to take down the Shepherd, she has to be there with us.&quot;</p>
<p>Freeing the Katz in Baird Marsh, we get an <strong>Earth Normin Suit</strong> for Eleanor!</p>
<p>We use a bottle to head back to the wharf...</p>
<p>There&#39;s Benwick with a sylphjay carrying a message...</p>
<p>It seems the Abbey&#39;s now about to strike.</p>
<p><strong>Benwick:</strong> &quot;They have orders to eliminate the Lord of Calamity!&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;...Looks like the hideout&#39;s not so hidden after all.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor denies saying anything to the Abbey.</p>
<p>Velvet decides that they&#39;re going to rescue the therions.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Eizen asks Benwick if he got that info from the Bloodwings. It&#39;s from a peddler.</p>
<p>Phi wonders if it&#39;s a trap. Probably. Velvet decides to spring it anyway.</p>
<p>Phi figures out that the exorcists are going to Titania as fusions...</p>
<p>Magilou points out Velvet can&#39;t consume fused exorcists.</p>
<p>Velvet makes up her mind...Oooh boy...</p>
<p>Magilou points out if the exorcists stay fused for a long time, their malakhim will get exposed to malevolence and become dragons. But Melchior was one step ahead...</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;To think they would go that far...&quot;</p>
<p>There&#39;s Bienfu at a distance. No one&#39;s asked him anything.</p>
<p>Magilou closes her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Skit:</strong> Eleanor wonders what the Abbey&#39;s move is if they let the crew capture their therions. Is it to ensure that we keep them in one place so they could take them back easy?</p>
<p>Eizen notices the Abbey&#39;s plan is flawed all over.</p>
<p>Magilou wonders if the Abbey actually needs the therions...</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Why did Melchior place that illusion on Aball to lure Velvet in?&quot;</p>
<p>To capture her, Phi thinks. But if he didn&#39;t, he would just make a new therion and take care of Velvet.</p>
<p>Melchior didn&#39;t bother with Orthie and Russ either...maybe they were experimental therions?</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;I don&#39;t understand it...it&#39;s like they&#39;re toying with us...&quot;</p>
<p>That&#39;s probably it. The therions are probably a red herring by Melchior and the Abbey!</p>
<p>Eizen thinks the Abbey&#39;s trying to mess with the crew.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Whatever&#39;s going on, I don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to like it...&quot;</p>
<p>A third <strong>skit: Siegfried and Armati.</strong></p>
<p>Rokurou asks Eleanor about the fusion arte that the Abbey developed.</p>
<p>Eleanor was well aware that there was a top secret department the Abbey had.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Word was that they were deciphering ancient scrolls and books coming from every corner of the empire.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor also points out that Teresa knows ancient languages and called upon her occasionally for assistance, namely for tomes meant to control malakhim.</p>
<p>Eizen points out that they knew about Siegfried and its powers from their research, and thus created the fusion ability.</p>
<p>Phi asks about Aifread.</p>
<p>Eizen&#39;s still worried about him...</p>
<p>It looks like Aifread might have also been subject to fusion experiments...ughhh...this is not good...</p>
<p>We get our rewards from the Bloodwing agent and see a new code red to fight, back in Titania!</p>

<p>We head for the north gate...</p>
<p>I wish I could take pics in this game...</p>
<p>If I hold circle, I can have my character walk instead of run.</p>
<p>The Elder mentions that his granddaughter spoke with them. Velvet denies threatening her in a denying-sounding voice.</p>
<p>The Elder now gives us cooking materials, and we can cook! Yessss! It&#39;s another great feature of the <em>Tales</em> franchise, and one of my favorites: <strong>cooking!</strong></p>
<p>I go through the tutorial of the cooking system...</p>
<p>Prickleboar Sausage is the only thing we can make on the menu.</p>
<p>Velvet cooks the sausage per the tutorial. Her response is a cold, &quot;Food&#39;s ready. It&#39;s nothing special.&quot;</p>
<p>The cooking system gives effects to the entire party depending on what meal&#39;s being prepped and who&#39;s doing the cooking.</p>
<p>I go through the auto-cook part of the tutorial this time...</p>
<p>Another skit plays. Rokurou feels refreshed after those sausages...he asks her a question. She says not to expect any answers.</p>
<p>Rokurou brings up the apple moment. He asks if she can&#39;t taste anything anymore...</p>
<p>She says she can only taste blood. <img class=emojione alt=☹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>She also thinks that she doesn&#39;t feel full from meals anymore.</p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s a bit shocked.</p>
<p>Not since Velvet became a daemon has she been able to feel satisfied from eating.</p>
<p>Rokurou asks what she&#39;s been eating...the response is that he was in the same prison as her. Different cells, though.</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s fine with what she is now, she says, but she looks a bit...down when she says that doesn&#39;t have to worry about taste when cooking...all that matters to her is that she gets her strength from it...oh my god...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Another skit:</strong> Rokurou mentions his alcohol he got as a complimentary gift from the weapon shop...</p>
<p>He&#39;s using the booze for something else: on his blade.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;By pouring it on the pegs that hold the blade and hilt together, the wood will swell and hold everything firmly in battle.&quot; This guy is a genuine swordsman...</p>
<p>The gatekeeper tells us that the north gate goes to Hadlow Hollow...we leave.</p>
<p>The utensils on the bottom right means the party&#39;s still full from the meal Velvet made...</p>
<p>It seems like we need to have an ability to crush or move this boulder that&#39;s blocking the cliff...</p>
<p>We head inside <strong>Hadlow Hollow, Cavern in the Northern Marsh</strong>.</p>
<p>We meet with our first encounter, three <strong>Octopuses</strong>!</p>
<p>The Octopus is glowing red, he&#39;s burnt from either Rokurou&#39;s or Velvet&#39;s attacks!</p>
<p>More pointers about soul gauges. The more souls I have, the more damage I can deliver! Plus, I get more info about switching characters mid-battle...</p>
<p>Velvet smells a stinky stench...it&#39;s oil.</p>
<p>She&#39;s nearly lost her sense of taste, but not her smell for some reason.</p>
<p>We go around the cave looking for more stuff...</p>
<p>In the near future, we might get an ability to cross this oil-filled pool...</p>
<p>Another boulder blocks the way. Velvet says that they can break this boulder. Rokurou doubts it. Velvet could use her arm to break it down...</p>
<p>Now I can break boulders, ho ho ho!</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Since I have Rokurou as my map display character, he just breaks the boulder down with a light kick!</p>
<p>Ahead, we see a Katz Box, but it needs 25 Katz spirits to open it! Ai ya!</p>
<p>We press on further...</p>
<p>It&#39;s not oil that Velvet smells. It&#39;s tar. I&#39;ve smelled tar before, and it is <strong>not</strong> a pleasant scent...</p>
<p>More pointers on how to jump over obstacles now.</p>
<p>We jump on the stones to the other side, but turn back since we have enough Katz spirits to open the chest...</p>
<p>We get a <strong>Rose Corsage</strong>, another accessory for freeing another Katz!</p>
<p>After a break, I head outside to break the boulder blocking the cliff...using Velvet as the lead, she high kicks the boulder into dust!</p>
<p>Back into the cave, where we outrun a fleet of Centipedes crawling about, and get more Katz spirits!</p>
<p>After a battle with <strong>Bat</strong>s, I have Rokurou cook more sausages...</p>
<p>I accidentally use Velvet’s Break Soul arte in one battle, taking care of the enemies more quicker...</p>
<p>Heading into a lone corner of the cave, we get a bountiful bonus of Katz spirits...and Chamomile.</p>
<p>Since Ive got plenty of them I use up some of the herbs to boost the party’s stats.</p>
<p>There’s a boulder on the edge of another tar pit...it could be pushed. We push it in.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;You know what they say! &#39;Falling off a rock only makes us stronger.&#39;&quot;</p>
<p>You mean &quot;the bigger they are, the harder they fall&quot; right, Rokurou?</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Instead of jumping to the other side of the tar pool, we head into another part of the cave.</p>
<p>More monsters here...</p>
<p>But the rewards are great: plenty of Katz spirits, and Rokurou getting new weapons, <strong>Shadow Daggers!</strong></p>
<p>The Shadow Daggers lower focus and Rokurou loses his health regen benefits from the Foreign Daggers, though. I equip it anyway.</p>
<p>We get more weapons for Rokurou after another battle: <strong>Amber Daggers!</strong></p>
<p>More level grinding here...</p>
<p>We&#39;re now in the third area of the cave. It looks like our goal&#39;s almost close...</p>
<p>Now this looks a bit unusual...there&#39;s a bat with a big demon mask on his face...</p>
<p>This might be a powerful foe, so we avoid him and get the chest...</p>
<p>Nope. Can&#39;t cross the tar pool here. There&#39;s no stepping stones...</p>
<p>Velvet compliments Rokurou on his swordsmanship. Rokurou thinks he has a long way to go before being satisfied.</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s curious about the type of daemon Rokurou is. He&#39;s a <strong>yaksha</strong>, a war daemon.</p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s now curious about the kind of daemon Velvet is. Rokurou&#39;s surprised about her being a therion, and asks what that is. The only thing Velvet knows is that she has the power to feed on other daemons.</p>
<p>Oh my god, Rokurou...Velvet does one of the best death glares though.</p>
<p><strong>Skit again:</strong> Velvet’s a self taught swordswoman, she says, the fundamentals of her swordskills are from...<strong>that man</strong>, though the martial artes are her own style...</p>
<p>Oh my god again, Rokurou, that smug smile on your face...smh...</p>
<p>Velvet asks why he wields two short swords and not the big one.</p>
<p>Rokurou smiles, hands on hips, saying that &quot;it&#39;s best that [he doesn&#39;t]&quot; wield it. The sword is part of his &quot;debt&quot; to his family.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;I don&#39;t get it.&quot;</p>
<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> I might get my research wrong here, but isn&#39;t House Rangetsu&#39;s debt-paying rule sort of similar to, at least, the equivalent of the general concept of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utang_na_loob>utang na loob</a>?</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I&#39;m really wanting to fight the bat with the scary mask now...</p>
<p>But, I head on further.</p>
<p>We&#39;re now in the depths of Hadlow Hollow...</p>
<p>Jumping past more tar pits now...</p>
<p>These monsters are quick to catch up to us...they really want a fight...</p>
<p>Rokurou asks about Velvet&#39;s sense of smell, which she says has gotten better.</p>
<p>All of Rokurou&#39;s senses have become more sharper after being a daemon.</p>
<p>Rokurou thinks eating daemons is not a &quot;pleasant diet.&quot; He usually drinks more than he eats. </p>
<p>Oh, Rokurou...lol...he then goes into a passionate speech about drinking, mentioning in vivid detail of the varieties, the aromas, and the flavors of different drinks...oh my god, this guy could&#39;ve been an alcohol connoisseur in another life. Plus, he adds that his hangovers go away faster now that he&#39;s a daemon.</p>
<p>Velvet doesn&#39;t care. She&#39;s like, &quot;whatever.&quot; I don&#39;t either.</p>
<p>We make it to the end of the cave. There&#39;s a save point, and a circle with a green aura, probably a warp point back to the entrance.</p>
<p>I turn a corner and break a boulder.</p>
<p>More treasures here too!</p>
<p>I&#39;m right! The green circle is actually called a <strong>warp point!</strong></p>
<p>We warp back to the entrance, and save outside.</p>
<p>I wish the game gave a primer on the types of daemons that exist in-game. What is a yaksha? Or a therion?</p>
<p>By the mark, I&#39;ve written a lot tonight!</p>

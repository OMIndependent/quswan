<p>Eleanor&#39;s now adjusting to Laphicet&#39;s powers.</p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s relieved, worried she might pass out again.</p>
<p>Eleanor and Laphicet are really becoming good friends.</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s in the corner, feeling left out. Phi notices. So does Magilou, and asks Phi about the true name Eleanor gave him.</p>
<p>Velvet has the same question I have too: What is a true name? I think Magilou mentioned this when she was tethering Bienfu to her.</p>
<p>Magilou explains a &quot;true name&quot; is the part of the malak-human pactmaking process. She mentions calling Bienfu Fuschie Cass as his true name, which means &quot;Thing.&quot; Fur fbhaqf n ovg yvxr Yhxr jura fur fnvq gung jbeq. She calls it &quot;her way of showing affection.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet asks Phi about his true name. Phi blushes and sweats. She&#39;s now suspicious about what name Eleanor gave him...Laphicet&#39;s not telling and runs off!</p>
<p>Eizen explains the importance of a malak&#39;s true name. It&#39;s very important.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Speaking a true name to anyone other than our pact keeper carries a special meaning. Between comrades, it means we trust them with our lives.&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou butts in again, calling someone by their true name &quot;a confession of love!&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet blushes, facepalming at the thought.</p>
<p>We get a <strong>Jacketless Outfit</strong> for Laphicet!</p>
<p>I equip the Featherlight Steps for Velvet, knowing from its benefits I can unleash a Mystic Arte quicker when she&#39;s wearing these!</p>
<p>Two Bloodwing soldiers flank the way to the plains...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>A dust storm&#39;s kicking in...and...is that a <strong>dragon</strong> flying above!?</p>
<p>But he&#39;s gone. Magilou thinks it&#39;s the daemon we&#39;re supposed to hunt.</p>
<p>Rokurou wonders if it&#39;s a therion.</p>
<p>Laphicet sensed another earthpulse point! It&#39;s on the top of the flat-topped mountain before the crew!</p>
<p>The full name of the place is <strong>Aldina Plains, Land of Vitality.</strong></p>
<p>It&#39;s pretty vast...</p>
<p>We face a lot of <strong>Hornets</strong> and <strong>Fairies</strong> in this area!</p>
<p>With the fog around, it looks like we&#39;re somewhere that wouldn&#39;t be too out of place in <em>Skyrim</em>, except the place is more green and vast.</p>
<p>I also face a trio of <strong>Aged Treants!</strong></p>
<p>Blocking the path to Galles Lake Road, I see a huge flying daemon!</p>
<p>We&#39;re now at the eastern part of Galles Lake Road...I explore there a bit.</p>
<p>Back to the plains, where I get another new item, a <strong>Soul Bottle</strong> in a chest near huge boulders!</p>
<p><strong>Expedition check:</strong> We get a new recipe: a <strong>Zesty Dream Herring Marinade!</strong></p>
<p>We&#39;ve now got 20 recipes! 10 more to go!</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>In the next area of the plains, and the only way open is the nearest one. The east and south ways are closed off...and there&#39;s a code red in an open meadow southeast of this area.</p>
<p>We get a <strong>Therapy Cat</strong> after freeing a nearby Katz!</p>
<p>So the big daemon flying around the way to the Lake Road is a <strong>Wyvern</strong>, huh?</p>
<p>Since we&#39;re dealing with dragons, I have Eizen equip a <strong>Mobius Loop</strong> as his weapon!</p>
<p>After one battle, Laphicet&#39;s awed by both Eizen and Rokurou. Both tell Laphicet not to be like the other...hee...</p>
<p>The east route&#39;s barred off since we need to be going to the earthpulse point.</p>
<p>I switch Eizen for Magilou.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Awww, can&#39;t a witch get a little downtime?&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;m near the place where the code red daemon is! It&#39;s a <strong>King Peacock!</strong> Look at those feathers! They&#39;re huge!</p>
<p>I look for more treasures here first.</p>
<p>Next stop: The mountain.</p>
<p>After a while, we get another treasure from the scouting ship: a pair of <strong>Moon and Star Earrings!</strong> Eleanor likes them...Phi points out they&#39;re earrings that make ones dream their best dreams. Laphicet would offer these to someone who&#39;s got nightmares.</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;I can feel the earthpulse right now. It&#39;s up above.&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Looks like we&#39;re in for some mountain climbing then.&quot;</p>
<p>Up the vines we climb...</p>
<p>There&#39;s a save point nearby and another treasure around the corner: <strong>Feldspar Boots!</strong></p>
<p>I save before trekking up the mountain.</p>

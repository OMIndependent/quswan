<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>I climb up the stairs to the deserted Sanctuary...</p>
<p>There&#39;s Grim sitting on one of the pews...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Magilou&#39;s real name is Magillanica, isn&#39;t it?&quot;<br>
<strong>Grimoirh:</strong> &quot;Yes, it is. She&#39;s always been so distant...she&#39;s always had strong resonance, and was able to see us malakhim since the day she was born.&quot;</p>
<p>Then Bienfu steps in, mentioning her family abandoned her... wow, this got deep really fast...</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s even shocked at this revelation!</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;So she got picked up by that crooked troupe...&quot;<br>
<strong>Bienfu:</strong> &quot;Yeah. That was when she caught m— When I got caught up in her life.&quot; How long ago was that?</p>
<p>Magilou&#39;s life is almost similar to the Phantom&#39;s...</p>
<p><strong>Grimoirh:</strong> &quot;You can see why she&#39;d want someone on her side, even if that someone was Bienfu.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor asked if Magilou fled the circus &quot;after the accident.&quot; Bienfu mentions that that &quot;accident&quot; was Melchior&#39;s doing.</p>
<p><strong>Grimoirh:</strong> &quot;Is it so hard to believe? Melchior was looking for someone he could shape into becoming his worthy successor, so he made sure she survived that wreck.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;He probably justified it as saving the world...&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet asks Grim if she had any connections with Melchior...</p>
<p>Grim knew him &quot;a little,&quot; but avoided him for the most part, and never mentioned anything personal.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;As I recall, Magilou trained under Melchior and rose as far up the ranks as legate.&quot;<br>
<strong>Bienfu:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s right. She worked really, really hard to get there too.&quot;<br>
<strong>Grimoirh:</strong> &quot;<strong>Magillanica Lou Mayvin. When Melchior adopted her and gave her his last name, that was the first time she really felt that she had a home. When she lost that name, she was devastated...</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>As Bienfu reveals, she failed one of his tests, and goodbye, Magillanica...</p>
<p>Melchior, you manipulative jerk!</p>
<p><strong>Grimoirh:</strong> &quot;She was an empty shell of a person when Bienfu brought her to me. Magilou stayed with me for a little while (maybe years, since Normin&#39;s measurement of time is longer than humans), but then one day, she left without warning...&quot;</p>
<p>She got captured and locked up in Titania.</p>
<p><strong>Grimoirh:</strong> &quot;I&#39;d ask you to look after her...but I know how that would go.&quot;</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Now another skit plays, where Grim apologizes to Magilou about telling her real past without her knowing...</p>
<p>Magilou&#39;s not worried, as she states that Magillanica&#39;s gone.</p>
<p><strong>Grimoirh</strong> asks Magilou something: &quot;It wasn&#39;t failing to hold up against Melchior&#39;s arte that broke your spirit, was it?&quot;</p>
<p>Grim points out the real reason why her &quot;spirit&quot; was gone.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Who can say? I&#39;ve left my life as Magillanica behind me. I&#39;m not her anymore. I&#39;m the evil witch Magilou who fights alongside the Lord of Calamity!&quot;<br>
<strong>Bienfu:</strong> &quot;Well, wherever you go, Miss Magilou, I&#39;ll follow you as long as I live!&quot;</p>
<p>Now she starts &quot;dealing&quot; with Bienfu for spilling things out about her past (even though it was Velvet who brought it up)...she noogies his cheek...</p>
<p>Magilou&#39;s enjoying her &quot;time&quot; with Bienfu...Bienfu calls her &quot;mean.&quot;</p>
<p>Grim laughs warmly.</p>
<p><strong>Grimoirh:</strong> &quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve finally found a place where you can belong...&quot;</p>
<p>We get a <strong>Color Variant Outfit</strong> set for Magilou!</p>
<p>We approach the empty altar...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;If you repent your sins in a sanctuary, the Empyreans are supposed to forgive you or something right? If I say something here, I wonder if Innominat will hear me.&quot;<br>
<strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;I don&#39;t think it works like that. Besides, I doubt this sanctuary was built on an earthpulse point.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh Laphicet, you scientist...</p>
<p>Laphicet asks Velvet if she had something to tell him.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Yeah...I wanted to thank him for the comb. And also tell him what I&#39;ll be doing next...&quot;<br>
<strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;I&#39;d say that everything you want to say has already made it over to Laphi...because I got it loud and clear myself.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Phi...&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Malakhim turn people&#39;s prayers into blessings. What you pray here and now may or may not reach Innominat, but it will give Laphicet strength.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Then I&#39;ll pray for just one thing: please take care of—&quot;</p>
<p>And that&#39;s it for that scene.</p>
<p>I stop for awhile before returning later for this session.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We go down to meet with Medissa.</p>
<p><strong>Medissa:</strong> &quot;Kamoana&#39;s come down with a fever.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor and Laphicet are in shock.</p>
<p>Is it because of the weather?</p>
<p><strong>Medissa:</strong> &quot;She just keeps mumbling over and over about how she doesn&#39;t want to take her mom&#39;s medicine...&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet mentions that they knew about it before. But when was that? I don&#39;t remember...</p>
<p>Eleanor thinks of checking back at Haria Village to find it...</p>
<p>Medissa doubts it might work because Kamoana&#39;s transformed into a therion, but Medissa decides to look for it. Velvet tells her no since she&#39;s wanted by the Abbey, and she&#39;s not letting Medissa go.</p>
<p><strong>Medissa:</strong> &quot;Don&#39;t try to stop me, Velvet.&quot;</p>
<p>Silent tension ensues between Velvet and Medissa.</p>
<p>Eleanor breaks the silence by saying that the crew will look for the medicine themselves. She&#39;s not letting Velvet fight, as &quot;it won&#39;t end well.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;And I would back her [Medissa] up too.&quot; She&#39;s doing this for Kamoana.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;If we have time to argue about this, we have time to go find that medicine ourselves.&quot;</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Velvet relents.</p>
<p>Medissa asks Eleanor why she&#39;s helping Kamoana. Eleanor opens up more about her past...</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;After my mother was taken from me, I found myself an orphan of the Abbey. I grew up figuring that I&#39;d probably become a nun and spend my life in mourning. But on the night of the Advent, my inner resonance awakened. I honestly believed that I had been given the power to change the world for the better...&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou&#39;s yawning...</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;But even after I&#39;d donned the mantle of the exorcists, I was still pathetic. Full of ideals, but so ignorant of the way things really work. That ignorance was what drove me to go after Mahina...&quot; No...</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;I can&#39;t change the past. But...I can atone. I&#39;d do anything to give her a chance.&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s head begins to hurt for some reason...</p>
<p><strong>Medissa:</strong> &quot;She&#39;s in your hands.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;What was that I just felt?&quot; Guilt from Eleanor?</p>
<p>Rokurou asks if he&#39;s okay. Laphicet &quot;sensed something, and it wasn&#39;t good...&quot; Could it be malevolence?</p>
<p>Laphicet asks Rokurou if Eleanor&#39;s the &quot;same.&quot; For the time being...</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;At least...that&#39;s what she projects.&quot; </p>
<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> I noticed a translation typo in that sentence (&quot;it&#39;s a cheap project,&quot; instead of &quot;that&#39;s what she projects&quot;). The sidequests and skits are getting more typos now...</p>
<p>Time to find that medicine!</p>

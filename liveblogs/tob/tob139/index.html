<p>Back at the town, the yaks are bundled up near the cave...</p>
<p>Dyle&#39;s happy we&#39;re alive!</p>
<p>A Bloodwing agent is here too. Velvet asks about the status of Loegres. Unsure, since the agent was from Hellawes.</p>
<p>But she tells us we&#39;re now in Class 4 land...</p>
<p>Every townsperson is now calling for the Lord of Calamity&#39;s execution.</p>
<p>Dyle suggests Meirchio as their hideout! Yes!!!</p>
<p>The Bloodwings are also pitching in to make the town a very good hideout!</p>
<p>I play another skit speaking to Dyle. He asks Rokurou about his duel with Shigure.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;I killed him.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;But I couldn&#39;t break Stormhowl.&quot;</p>
<p>Dyle wonders why. It seems that Kurogane&#39;s found his Stormquell, since Stormhowl did not damage it at all!</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;I think I just couldn&#39;t break Stormhowl because I&#39;m still too inexperienced.&quot;</p>
<p>Dyle declares that sword to be Stormquell too!</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Do you think Kurogane would agree?&quot;</p>
<p>Dyle calls Kurogane &quot;stubborn&quot; and would probably get to work on something better...</p>
<p>He also advises Rokurou to get stronger too.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;By my hand, Kurogane&#39;s Stormquell will become even more legendary than Stormhowl ever was.&quot;<br>
<strong>Dyle:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s the spirit! Show &#39;em what we daemons can do!&quot;</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>From Dyle, Benwick&#39;s back on the ship...</p>
<p>We do some long equipment customizations, and shop business.</p>
<p>I get our rewards for beating the Code Reds...</p>
<p>In the inn, a Bloodwing agent tells us he thought the volcano erupted when we woke up the Empyreans!</p>
<p>Even the pirate&#39;s still doing his job as innkeeper.</p>
<p>I save before resting. I know a skit&#39;s coming up...</p>
<p>Bienfu and Grimoirh have their own &quot;before the final battle&quot; dialogue. </p>
<p>Bienfu&#39;s very unsure.</p>
<p>Grimoirh&#39;s focused on the job.</p>
<p>Bienfu feels unappreciated by Magilou. Poor Bienfu...</p>
<p>Grimoirh&#39;s eyes widen, telling him &quot;she&#39;s not the type to do that sort of thing.&quot;</p>
<p>Grim suggests being a spy for the Abbey if he&#39;s not happy with being Magilou&#39;s malak. Nope.</p>
<p>Grim cuts to the point. Bienfu doesn&#39;t know if he&#39;s being helpful or not, especially when they&#39;re going to take on Innominat this time...</p>
<p><strong>Grimoirh:</strong> &quot;But you&#39;ll still go, won&#39;t you?&quot;<br>
<strong>Bienfu:</strong> &quot;Of course I will! Or my name isn&#39;t Normin Breyve!&quot; That&#39;s very breyve of him...</p>
<p><strong>Grimoirh:</strong> &quot;See? You can do this. You&#39;ve been keeping Magilou safe this whole time. With all the [...] pain she&#39;s been through, she&#39;s needed someone as [...] tenacious as you. She may talk like she doesn&#39;t care, but she wouldn&#39;t have tracked you down and renewed [your pact] if she didn&#39;t.&quot;</p>
<p>Bienfu cries tears of joy.</p>
<p><strong>Grimoirh:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s right. You just trust in old Normin Theruhpist&#39;s good advice. It won&#39;t steer you wrong...&quot;</p>
<p>Hee...Normin Theruhpist...</p>
<p>There&#39;s Kamoana with the dogs, and Griffin behind her...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I use a bottle to warp to Hellawes.</p>
<p>But I go to Beardsley instead. The villagers wonder about Meirchio, though.</p>
<p>Some of the villagers heard or saw the lights from the Empyreans awakening...</p>
<p>One man wonders who&#39;s stronger: the Lord of Calamity or the Shepherd?</p>
<p>After countless rounds on the geoboard mini-game (where I win a <strong>Bedhead</strong>), I go to Hellawes.</p>
<p>The townspeople are confused that the exorcists are confused.</p>
<p>The Teresa devotee&#39;s not happy Teresa&#39;s gone, and wants her back in Hellawes...oh my god...</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Teresa won&#39;t be coming back.&quot; She tells him to be &quot;strong enough to protect her.&quot;</p>
<p>The Teresa fan&#39;s now an Eleanor fan too. It&#39;s the &quot;burning glare.&quot;</p>
<p>Inside the bar, a woman spreads rumors to an old man about our exploits in Meirchio.</p>
<p>The old man&#39;s resigned to the fact that the Abbey can&#39;t be relied upon.</p>
<p>So much dramatic irony. The Lord of Calamity and her pals listen in on this conversation.</p>
<p>The woman curses the Lord of Calamity.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> (to Velvet) &quot;You&#39;re quite the popular girl. Why not wave to your fans?&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Yeah. That&#39;s a good idea.&quot;</p>
<p>A merchant now wants to take the flamestone in Mt. Killaraus all for himself!</p>
<p>In the inn, a family tells about the Lord of Calamity too.</p>
<p>A bard sings about Musiphe, the Empyrean of Flame.</p>
<p>Outside, townspeople are mentioning undersea volcanoes erupting, a tornado in the mountains, and an eight-headed dragon...</p>
<p>An exorcist situated at the sanctuary doors tell us about Shigure and Melchior. I laugh a bit at his prediction.</p>
<p>The citizens of Meirchio inside the sanctuary demand to the priest that they want the Shepherd to come quickly.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>A believer&#39;s planning to evacuate Hellawes out to sea...</p>
<p>Eleanor suggests going by land too...and the believer points out the malakhim have been freed...</p>
<p>Eleanor tells them to guard the city and call to the Abbey for help just in case...</p>
<p>Eleanor tells them not to lose hope!</p>
<p>She thinks of writing back to her old Abbey friends to help Hellawes.</p>
<p>A girl saw a malak talking and disappeared...</p>
<p>The fishermen tells his son not to be afraid &quot;of some Lord of Calamity!&quot; He decides to catch as much fish as possible for survival.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;That is one hot-headed dad.&quot;<br>
<strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;Too hot for any daemons to get near, that&#39;s for sure.&quot;</p>
<p>Looks like everyone&#39;s determined to get back up on their feet...</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Now to Benwick...</p>
<p><strong>Benwick:</strong> &quot;Welcome back! I take it you defeated the legates.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;...but that still leaves Innominat and the Shepherd.&quot;</p>
<p>Benwick gives us something, an apple! A Fortune Apple! For luck!</p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s amazed...</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Hmmm...but we&#39;re the bad guys, aren&#39;t we? Maybe what we need is bad luck instead.&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;I think the Reaper&#39;s got that covered.&quot;<br>
<strong>Benwick:</strong> &quot;Awww, that&#39;s just mean.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet juggles with the apple a bit and gives Benwick her thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;I love apples.&quot;<br>
<strong>Benwick:</strong> &quot;Don&#39;t just eat it!&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;I couldn&#39;t eat it, even if I wanted.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> (thinking) &quot;Wait a moment, that&#39;s right. My power to consume is a part of Innominat. If that&#39;s true, then...&quot;</p>
<p>She offers Laphicet the apple.</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;No way. That&#39;s a good luck charm.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;That it is. One to give you the courage you need to survive.&quot;</p>
<p>Benwick asks where we&#39;re off to...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;The Empyrean&#39;s Throne.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Sail for Port Zekson!&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor wonders about what will happen to the suppression now that Innominat&#39;s becoming weaker...</p>
<p>Eleanor suggests traveling around the world. Good idea. Laphicet agrees, wanting to meet with the awakened Empyreans.</p>
<p>Eizen doesn&#39;t think so, since they might be in random parts around the world...</p>
<p>Rokurou also thinks they might not be on our side either.</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s also thinking about taking up sidequests as well...</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;Just don&#39;t eat him, got it?&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;I won&#39;t. Don&#39;t worry.&quot;</p>
<p><a name=6></a></p>
<hr>
<p>A pirate tells Rokurou he found a Class 4 island fit for his sword skills, filled with daemons like Lancelot...</p>
<p>Plus, it was a competition ground for swordspeople...Eizen knows where that place is.</p>
<p>The pirate warns us the place &quot;could be fatal.&quot; We&#39;ve taken down two legates. How fatal is it?</p>
<p>The Armored Quarter&#39;s at a gulf southeast of Eastgand.</p>
<p>And the Fiend Quarter&#39;s directly east of Mt. Killaraus...</p>
<p>The <em>Van Eltia</em> has to circle around Westgand to get there...</p>
<p>I free a Katz from a Box and fight the daemon horde!</p>
<p>I win tons of equipment and a <strong>Mythril Waistcoat!</strong></p>
<p>Now for the Armored Quarter...</p>
<p>Since the island&#39;s in Eastgand, the place looks very autumnal...</p>
<p>Our first wave of Armored daemons are the three golems: <strong>Lava Atlas</strong>, <strong>Red Mist Watcher</strong>, and a <strong>Rock Golem!</strong></p>
<p>After that wave, we win a <strong>Guandao</strong>, and more weapons, along with a <strong>Haggler&#39;s Acerite!</strong></p>
<p>Now to our main destination: the capital!</p>
<p><a name=7></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Velvet&#39;s looking out to the sea...Eleanor approaches her.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;So what was it you needed to say to me alone?&quot; Velvet asks where Laphicet is. Sleeping.</p>
<p>Oh, Laphicet, he really wants to help Velvet...and act as tough as Velvet.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;He&#39;s nothing like me. His motivation comes from hope.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;...Hope...&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;The wind is nice...&quot; Is she starting to feel the weather again?</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;<strong>Yes, the world may teem with hardship and sadness, but it&#39;s also filled with beauty.</strong> The endless ocean. The islands in the south. Even the frozen tundra, and the mountains that spew fire.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;It is. And humans make their home among all that beauty...<strong>this is the world that Laphi always yearned to travel. I finally understand what he saw when he sat looking out over the ocean.</strong>&quot; :&#39;)</p>
<p>Velvet asks Eleanor to protect Laphicet if something happens...</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;What? Is something the matter?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;The power possessed by the therions and Innominat is fundamentally the same. I have a theory...no...too rational. A different part of me, something separate from my hatred, wants me to do something.&quot; She&#39;s talking about Seres, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>It wants me to leave this world with hope.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s realizing it too...</p>
<p>Velvet reminds her about her favor: to keep Laphicet safe.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;While I&#39;d love to take advantage of this weakness, I can&#39;t.&quot; Good. She remembers her oath to Velvet. Velvet almost forgot that.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Good thing I kicked your butt after all.&quot;</p>
<p><a name=8></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Back to Port Zekson we go...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Well, the suppression...is gone.&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;And in its place, rampaging daemons.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;We expected that. Thanks. For everything.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Let&#39;s go. We&#39;ve a fight to finish with the Shepherd.&quot;</p>
<p>Another <strong>skit: Facing Reality.</strong></p>
<p>Rokurou and Eizen point out that the daemonblight is still alive and well. Without Innominat and the Abbey, the people are on their own. Eleanor&#39;s trying to hold back her realization...</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;But this is who I am now. It&#39;s on me to own up, face my fears, and keep moving forward.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet doesn&#39;t mind her company.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;You don&#39;t have to bear the weight of the world alone though.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;...I&#39;ll do what I can.&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;You always say that, but then you end up overdoing it, right? If you push yourself to the limit and it&#39;s still not enough, there&#39;s no shame in relying on others.&quot; That lesson Rokurou had to learn himself too.</p>
<p>Eleanor thanks him.</p>
<p>Rokurou teases her by pointing out she&#39;s thanking a daemon. She knows.</p>

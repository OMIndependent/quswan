<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>Back to Loegres now, where there&#39;s a lot of rumors about the Lord of Calamity spreading.</p>
<p>From a boy, I learn the Shepherd&#39;s card rank in Exorcist Cards is 10, and it&#39;s been banned in official tournaments!?</p>
<p>Two girls sitting on crates tell their adults to get their acts together...</p>
<p>At least the prince is now calling his citizens to action...a nobleman and a priest are aware of the Suppression&#39;s effects.</p>
<p>Near the tavern now, we pick up our bounty for fighting the Weighty Witch!</p>
<p>If I were to do this in order, I should&#39;ve started with Magilou&#39;s sidequest before Eleanor&#39;s...</p>
<p>The merchant and the young man agree about keeping things in moderation, but they understand they need to have relief sometimes. So their next move is to start up a restaurant.</p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s curious about the food they&#39;ll serve up. They&#39;re working on it. But they have mabo curry as their starting point.</p>
<p>Laphicet doesn&#39;t like being called a kid by the merchant.</p>
<p>The merchant apologizes, saying he was focused on his &quot;mission statement.&quot; Laphicet asks what he means by that. They want a family-friendly restaurant, &quot;feeding [their customers] from cradle to grave.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet points out the flaw in mentioning graves. Eleanor mentions courage in eating in such a place. The merchant takes their advice pretty well.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Are you sure you&#39;re up for starting up a restaurant?&quot;</p>
<p>The merchant and youth can&#39;t think of a slogan for their dining establishment...</p>
<p>Eleanor and Magilou jump in with their ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;They&#39;ve got a looong road ahead of them.&quot;</p>
<p>Inside the tavern we go, where a Bloodwing soldier mentions that the prince has tons of leaked info now, mentioning that Tabatha and Prince Percival have made strides in managing the city.</p>
<p>A Bloodwing agent asks Eleanor...</p>
<p>...to sign an Exorcist Card of her! A Rank 5! She&#39;s a bit shocked! Plus, it&#39;s a rare card since it got &quot;recalled&quot; after her betrayal!</p>
<p>Eleanor feels &quot;a bit honored.&quot;</p>
<p>Tabatha&#39;s looking at her stocks of wine.</p>
<p>She&#39;s more concerned about her tavern...noticing the food&#39;s dusty and the wine emptied out...</p>
<p>Laphicet asks if they have supplies for mabo curry.</p>
<p><strong>Tabatha:</strong> &quot;You just focus on what you have to do. Just make sure you don&#39;t have any regrets.&quot;</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We talk to her again. She knows we beat legate Shigure.</p>
<p><strong>Tabatha:</strong> &quot;As I understand it, succession of the Rangetsu Clan goes to the one who kills his predecessor. That means you&#39;re the successor, Rokurou. Or have you taken the name Shigure, now?&quot;</p>
<p>So Shigure Rangetsu is more or less the head of the clan&#39;s name than the actual name of the person.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;You have to kill the head of the clan to succeed them?!&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;I don&#39;t intend to step up as the new head. But how do you know about my family&#39;s customs?&quot;<br>
<strong>Tabatha:</strong> &quot;We&#39;re all part of the same underworld...a long time ago we tried to assassinate another Shigure, but we lost 30 of our number instead.&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Naturally. It&#39;d take more than that to do a Shigure in.&quot;<br>
<strong>Tabatha:</strong> &quot;I wonder if even 300 men would&#39;ve been enough. You Shigures are a tough bunch. Look at your brother, he was a legate.&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Yeah, he was probably the strongest head the clan ever had.&quot;<br>
<strong>Tabatha:</strong> &quot;That being said...did you know there&#39;s a daemon out there not even he managed to cut down?&quot; <strong>What!?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tabatha</strong> explains further: &quot;a swordsman who looked like a dragon&quot;!? That must be a malak turned malevolent!</p>
<p>She mentions it was near the Empyrean&#39;s Throne...hmmm...</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Sounds like a job only I can handle.&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou tries to stop him, Laphicet tells her don&#39;t. Eleanor agrees.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Besides, I think we&#39;re all fools here.&quot; True.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;A dragon swordsman not even Shigure could kill...I&#39;m getting excited just thinking about it.&quot;<br>
<strong>Tabatha:</strong> &quot;Good luck!&quot;</p>
<p>From the agent, the dragon swordsman&#39;s formal name is a <strong>Dragonfolk!</strong></p>
<p>A girl near the fountain&#39;s crying, saying she misses her mother...</p>
<p>A believer mentions the Lord of Calamity again, and another mentions the losses of life all because of the Suppression, but they need to &quot;smile in the face of sadness.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Now that&#39;s a real man. The old guy knows what&#39;s what.&quot;</p>
<p>The believer believes even a tinge of joy is a necessity to have. He points to the fountain as &quot;a symbol of hope.&quot;</p>
<p>He works to keep the fountain running...</p>
<p>In place of this &quot;necessary&quot; practicality, what the Lord of Calamity unintentionally gave the citizens was hope.</p>
<p>Along with unity...</p>
<p>Even malakhim of their own free will vow to fight for humans...</p>
<p>The youthful merchant mention how Percival &quot;used to be so perfect it was creepy.&quot; Prince Percival&#39;s learned a lot from the crew...</p>
<p>We make weapon upgrades and buy Legendary Tofu from the shop here!</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I have Velvet cook up the Mabo Curry Bun...</p>
<p>One townsperson mentions that it&#39;s the Shepherd who&#39;s the only high-profile exorcist left...</p>
<p>In the inn, another client got locked out of his room again!</p>
<p>Back to the weapon shop, and I&#39;m surprised that we&#39;ve collected a lot of pendants for Eizen!</p>
<p>After some more weapon dismantling, we meet with a maid who has a lute on her back! She&#39;s started up her band: the Fantaskicks!</p>
<p>In the sanctuary, one woman&#39;s afraid of malakhim attacking humans. Many others are cheering themselves up praying to the Shepherd to finish off the Lord of Calamity...</p>
<p>The soldiers are worried about the Empyrean&#39;s Throne left unprotected, but that&#39;s the Shepherd&#39;s orders. He knows Velvet&#39;s coming...plus he wants the city to be safe.</p>
<p>One priest and a couple of exorcists are realizing that malakhim are people too.</p>
<p><strong>Priest:</strong> &quot;We have made a grave shameful misunderstanding.&quot; No kidding.</p>
<p>Another <strong>priest</strong> mentions good truth: &quot;<strong>Prayer brings solace to the one praying.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>The Bloodwing soldier mentions Prince Percival is at the villa.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Nuh uh. No way. I&#39;m not going to assassinate him for you.&quot; Don&#39;t, Velvet.</p>
<p>The soldier tells us that the Prince and Tabatha are now &quot;drinking buddies.&quot;</p>
<p>We talk to a young man, who&#39;s actually the bandit we met at the Brigid Ravine! He&#39;s now about to open his &quot;bandit cuisine&quot; restaurant!</p>
<p>Rokurou thinks he stole the money. Oh, Rokurou...look at yourself in the mirror...</p>
<p>The reformed bandit worked too hard, helping the city.</p>
<p>Eleanor believes him, and knows that &quot;good things will come his way.&quot;</p>
<p>He&#39;s trying to expand his menu. And he&#39;s trying to beat out the tavern&#39;s mabo curry. Eleanor suggests adding in dessert such as a Creme Brulee tart, or a &quot;Theft By Chocolate Cake&quot;. Looks like the Bloodwings are getting competition...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Well, that&#39;s certainly aggressive...&quot;</p>
<p>He asks for her hand in marriage.</p>
<p>Eleanor giggles, telling him not to &quot;tease an exorcist.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor wishes him luck on the restaurant.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Miss-holier-than-thou delivered some just desserts.&quot;<br>
<strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;Sweet Rejection... it&#39;d make a good cake name.&quot;</p>
<p>The reformed bandit throws a cake and a pie pun as we leave.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Now to the villa...</p>
<p>There&#39;s Prince Percival reading at the library...</p>
<p>There&#39;s an aristocrat shaming a Bloodwing agent...hoo boy...</p>
<p>Another rich man tells us that Percival will be &quot;the fifth king of Midgand.&quot;</p>
<p>He also mentions that the prince &quot;intends to revise the calendar to help the people make a fresh start.&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet explains that the game&#39;s world&#39;s using the &quot;Desolation Calendar.&quot;</p>
<p>The aristocrat mentions that the new calendar&#39;s called the &quot;Greenwood calendar.&quot;</p>
<p>One priest says the Church is going to reorganize itself...</p>
<p>Some are not too comfortable with the alliance between the royalty and the Bloodwings, but they still think the mabo curry is delicious.</p>
<p>After exploring the villa, we talk to the prince. He mentions what he plans to do next after the Shepherd&#39;s been taken care of by the crew.</p>
<p><strong>Percival:</strong> &quot;I intend to eliminate all mention of the Shepherd and his exorcists from the official histories.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh my god!</p>
<p><strong>Percival:</strong> &quot;...but the memory will live on in the hearts of the people. They will be saviors, wizards, swindlers, according to how people remember them.&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;An echo of how people remember those born with resonance in the past. Those who bear both power and ideals walk thorny paths indeed.&quot;<br>
<strong>Percival:</strong> &quot;Indeed they do. But that is how it should be. I believe that those who can bring hope to the world are those who accept—love, even—humans&#39; chaotic nature.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet tells him if she loses, then what the Prince will do next won&#39;t be useful.</p>
<p><strong>Percival:</strong> &quot;Hah. Even so, I will resist until the bitter end. I have words for the Shepherd and Innominat. &#39;What&#39;s wrong with being a flawed human being?&#39;&quot;</p>
<p>Strong words there...</p>

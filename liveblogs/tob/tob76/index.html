<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>Now to explore the hideout...Eleanor&#39;s not at the docks.</p>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/vyAd52EySNQ>Here&#39;s the music that plays in the hideout.</a></p>
<p>Kurogane and Rokurou enjoying themselves to drinks again. Sigh...</p>
<p>Oh Rokurou, you drunk guy, you...</p>
<p>He&#39;s mentioning all of the not-very-good stuff that we did so far. He wonders all of the charges they&#39;d be faced with if they were caught.</p>
<p>Velvet don&#39;t care. It&#39;s either you&#39;re with her or not. Rokurou&#39;s staying for the whole ride.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;You really just want to beat Shigure, don&#39;t you?&quot; Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Rokurou offers her a drink. She&#39;s still underage. &quot;[She&#39;s] 19.&quot;</p>
<p>Lol. Of all the devastating things (razing a port, trying to assassinate people, and eating prisoners) she&#39;s done so far, yet she&#39;s not taking a drink...good for you, Velvet. Don&#39;t say yes to that automatically even if you turn legal age.</p>
<p>The pirates are relieved that they don&#39;t have to maintain the <em>Van Eltia</em> everytime and they have solid ground to sleep on...</p>
<p>Grim and Laphicet are still interpreting the book...</p>
<p>Another nod to another <em>Tales</em> game jvgu &quot;Ybavxlyr&quot; naq &quot;zvqevss.&quot;</p>
<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> Xlyr naq Ybav ner gjb znva punenpgref sebz <em>Gnyrf bs Qrfgval VV</em>, jvgu gur sbezre znva punenpgre snzbhf sbe uvf jneqebor nf orvat n zvqevss. </p>
<p>Another reference to <em>Gnyrf bs Kvyyvn</em> jvgu &quot;Zhmrgzvyyn.&quot; Cerfrag!zr ahaf ng guvf ersrerapr.</p>
<p>Velvet asks Laphicet where Eleanor is. She tells him to find more light to read the book. Even as a therion, she still looks out for other people&#39;s well being.</p>
<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> For some reason, I&#39;m starting to imagine Velvet as the Red Paladin. She fits qualities meant for that job: she thinks fast on her feet, and she&#39;s driven...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Grim&#39;s still complaining about being dragged out of Southgand, but she likes Laphicet&#39;s passion for learning.</p>
<p>I talk to the bunch in the corner. The Prince asks Griffin if the hawks have found Eleanor too. Velvet calls the prince &quot;odd.&quot; Dyle&#39;s thinking of renaming the prison island...</p>
<p>Eizen&#39;s at the perch, looking at the ragtag band below.</p>
<p>He&#39;s still planning his move on when to rescue his captain...he plans to go on the offensive with the Abbey &quot;to shake them and see what shakes loose.&quot;</p>
<p>Aifread never flinches from even the most awful seas...</p>
<p>Eizen asks if Velvet catches colds. She says can&#39;t feel any temperature at this point.</p>
<p>Magilou&#39;s leaning on the wall in the hall...doing something, which is doing nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Right! I&#39;m busy being unoccupied.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;You&#39;re too [unusual] for this world, Magilou.&quot; Oh, Velvet...<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Says the woman with the world&#39;s blandest personality.&quot; Or the angriest.</p>
<p>Velvet rightfully points out that Magilou&#39;s the type to run &quot;when things get hairy.&quot; Magilou&#39;s still betting that Velvet&#39;s revengeathon will fail...</p>
<p>Then Magilou gets a bit philosophical on us.</p>
<p>I check the map: Eleanor&#39;s on the top of the north watchtower.</p>
<p>Two pirates are arguing whether to call Titania a hideout or a secret fort...</p>
<p>There&#39;s Benwick! He thanks Velvet for giving the pirates a good hideout!</p>
<p>One pirate&#39;s made up an anthem for the hideout!</p>
<p>Another confirms Eleanor&#39;s in the watchtower too.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>There&#39;s Eleanor at the top of the tower.</p>
<p>Looks like Eleanor&#39;s gotten character development! She now sees Kamoana as a &quot;lonely little girl&quot; instead of a therion.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;They all live and think as humanly as the rest of us.&quot; Though, imo, her human bias needs to be cut out...Velvet&#39;s pause sort of agrees with my feelings to that bias.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;I was so clueless. I didn&#39;t know what daemonblight really was, nor what the Abbey was doing...Through it all, I...I knew nothing beyond...whatever I was taught.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet repeats the oft-used line &quot;ignorance is bliss.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;The coward&#39;s path is not that of an exorcist! They may say &#39;I didn&#39;t know anything! So I can&#39;t be blamed!&#39; I can&#39;t...I can&#39;t live like that!&quot; She&#39;s almost in tears again. Fur vf n ovg yvxr Yhxr nsgre Nxmrevhgu...</p>
<p>She tells Velvet to tell Kamoana she&#39;s fine. Velvet warns her not to catch cold. Eleanor thanks her. Velvet pulls off the &quot;it&#39;s not like I care about you or anything&quot; facade. Oh, Velvet...</p>

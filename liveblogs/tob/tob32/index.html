<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>More talking with citizens, a praetor mentions that he had resonance and joined the Abbey. Velvet, in her head, asks if he&#39;s well aware of the price of that power...</p>
<p>Opening another gold chest, we get a <strong>Plain Pendant...</strong></p>
<p>From an exorcist, it seems that Melchior and Artorius planned everything for ten years, and this is their plan in its fruition.</p>
<p>One person&#39;s not too comfortable about malakhim, fearing they might end up becoming daemons...the exorcists reassure him. Eeee...I&#39;m more creeped out by the exorcists ordering malakhim to speak &quot;unless ordered to.&quot;</p>
<p>In an alley, some people mention the mystery of Artorius&#39;s past. He just came out of nowhere with malak, took care of daemons, and had exorcists join him. Velvet knows the dodginess of that story. </p>
<p>But Midgand, out of desperation, since it was becoming overrun with daemons, gave all powers to him. Velvet&#39;s thinking this is his way of gaining power. That&#39;s how dictators usually form. The populace, desperate for a strongman, or in this case, someone who could take care of daemons, got behind him and gave him power, and he used it against the populace or rather the whole world.</p>
<p>But, as the locals say, he&#39;s working super hard &quot;to death&quot; to rebuild Midgand and the royal family&#39;s reputation. No corrupt motives.</p>
<p>The conclusion they reach is that he has no other reasons, but to &quot;save the world.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Expedition check:</strong> We get a new recipe, yes!</p>
<p>We head into the tavern. Only a bartender and a woman in black&#39;s there...</p>
<p>Velvet asks the bartender food for Laphicet. They offer their best mabo curry. Mmmm...</p>
<p>Velvet asks for Baskerville. He&#39;s been executed... <img class=emojione alt=☹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Now everyone&#39;s at the bar...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s enjoying the mabo curry. Velvet can&#39;t taste it... <img class=emojione alt=☹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>The woman in black asks Velvet if Laphicet the malak&#39;s her brother. In another time...</p>
<p>The woman mentions that Velvet&#39;s real brother was murdered. <strong>What!?</strong> How&#39;d she...</p>
<p><strong>Woman in black:</strong> &quot;<strong>The shadows watch those who flinch from the light.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>With that, Eizen knows the guild&#39;s still up and running.</p>
<p>So the woman in black is the contact for the shadow guild. Velvet asks for Artorius&#39;s next plans. The shadow guild asks for a &quot;not so cheap&quot; price, as how guilds like these usually work. I&#39;m reminded of the Thieves Guild and the Dark Brotherhood here...</p>
<p>The woman gives Velvet some jobs to do, (&quot;not one remotely legal&quot;) all of them fit for that organization. She tells her to take all of them...</p>
<p>I&#39;m now given three choices: <strong>Destroy goods</strong>, <strong>search for a missing man,</strong> or <strong>foil an ambush</strong>. Hmmm...</p>
<p>I take on the second job. <strong>Mendi</strong> is the missing man, last seen along the <strong>Galles Lake Road</strong>.</p>
<p>She hands out forged document papers to Velvet under &quot;Magilou&#39;s Menagerie.&quot; Velvet&#39;s not impressed. The woman in black knows about their escapade at the front gate too, huh?</p>
<p>As always, should the job fail, the secretary, or in this case, the woman in black, will disavow any knowledge of our actions.</p>
<p>She gives us a free night at the tavern.</p>
<p>Rokurou and Eizen are drinking to their heart&#39;s content. Oh my god, these guys...</p>
<p>Eizen now asks the woman in black about Aifread. She promises to give him updated info on him for free.</p>
<p>Eizen mentions a pendulum (pbhyq Qrmry or va guvf tnzr?) and Velvet&#39;s info to her.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Rokurou and Eizen drink some more.</p>
<p>Eizen asks Rokurou why he&#39;s teaming up with her. To repay his debt to Velvet.</p>
<p>Eizen considers a daemon repaying a debt &quot;ridiculous,&quot; like the idea of a pirate malak.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;No matter how you look at it, there&#39;s nothing &#39;reasonable&#39; about our rogue existence. And in this brave new world governed by reason, a rogue can either rage and become a monster like me, or...&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Or band together with others like a shipful or pirates, perhaps.&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Exactly. I admire Velvet&#39;s courage, squaring off against the whole world on her own. Few can accomplish that. It takes [...] real strength. And I&#39;m curious where it comes from.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s doing this for himself. So&#39;s Eizen.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;I need allies [...] to combat this so-called order imposed by the Abbey. But anyone who&#39;s willing to put up with the &#39;creed&#39; folly of Aifread&#39;s pirates has to be an even bigger fool than we are.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh, Eizen. She wants vengeance. Inigo Montoya, then, in Eizen&#39;s eyes, would be a fool.</p>
<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> But, metawise, there&#39;s something interesting and exciting about reading or playing vengeance stories, imo. Probably that&#39;s the reason why this game&#39;s very engaging so far...</p>
<p>Eizen calls the &quot;foolishness&quot; label a &quot;compliment.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;[Aifread] flies his fool flag proudly.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou and Eizen drink each other&#39;s drinks.</p>
<p>Magilou on the roof now. She mentions that &quot;Artorius has got the populace eating from the palm of his hand.&quot;</p>
<p>She now talks like a narrator. I&#39;m betting that Magilou&#39;s the informant for the shadow guild. That&#39;s how the woman in black knew about Velvet&#39;s brother&#39;s death.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;<strong>Just how deeply will the fangs of this would-be tragic heroine scar this broken world of ours?</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>She sees this as a good show to watch.</p>
<p>I quick save here since I want to see that cutscene again. I think I might&#39;ve missed a few things.</p>

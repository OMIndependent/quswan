<p>At the north docks, a pirate tells us he went to a Class 4 island on a dare. But he didn&#39;t even touch the island, as daemon monsters came onto his ship! Yikes!</p>
<p>The White Turtlez is in the hideout too...</p>
<p>After some shopping, we talk to another pirate realizing why the Abbey used Titania as a prison, mentioning &quot;rapid sea currents&quot; as one of the big reasons, along with storms and fog...</p>
<p>Eizen agrees. Rokurou believes the first time he escaped with Velvet and Magilou and made it out alive was luck.</p>
<p>Now for Benwick, saying &quot;that the ship&#39;s ready to leave whenever.&quot; We head in.</p>
<p>The <em>Van Eltia</em> sails west!</p>
<p>Laphicet finds our first earthpulse point, in the middle of the ocean! No therions around...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Looks like this is a bust then.&quot;<br>
<strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;Sorry, everyone.&quot; <img class=emojione alt=☹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Except Rokurou points out there might be fish therion. Eizen pulls out something: a fishing rod!</p>
<p>Fujibayashi&#39;s Rod he calls it, and explains its qualities in huge detail. Yikes, Eizen...</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s as perfect a fishing rod as there can be.&quot;</p>
<p>Everyone&#39;s looking at him blankly.</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s like, &quot;are you sure?&quot; Eizen&#39;s insistent.</p>
<p>Velvet says no to the &quot;whole fishing idea.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s hungry, though, and doesn&#39;t mind fishing. Magilou too. Velvet&#39;s not impressed.</p>
<p>It&#39;s Velvet&#39;s first time fishing and she&#39;s setting up the rod...</p>
<p>Rokurou, Velvet doesn&#39;t come from the same place you&#39;re from. Even I&#39;m a novice when it comes to fishing.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s just been a while. I used to go fishing with my brother sometimes.&quot;</p>
<p>This is Laphicet&#39;s first time fishing. Velvet begins to teach him, then Eleanor steps in!</p>
<p>Eleanor mentions a villager named Tenny, who taught her how to fish. She gloats about catching &quot;100 Triet loaches.&quot; N <em>Flzcubavn</em> ersrerapr!</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;These two really get along. If I didn&#39;t know better, I&#39;d think she&#39;s his sister, not his vessel.&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou teases Velvet that if she isn&#39;t careful, &quot;Eleanor will steal him away.&quot;</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s teaching Laphicet fishing. </p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s trying to get his attention.</p>
<p>I get this flashback image of Velvet and her brother fishing...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/DhBGfh6.png alt="velvet and laphi fishing" width=480 height=270 id=hd-liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>Laphi!!</strong>&quot;<br>
<strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;Huh? You mean me?&quot;</p>
<p>She tells him to be careful not to fall, mentioning that her brother fell into the water... <img class=emojione alt=☹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Velvet mentions to malak!Laphicet that he reminds her of her brother Laphi...</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;If you say so. Is that all you wanted to say to me?&quot;</p>
<p>He goes back to fishing.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;People aren&#39;t as easily swapped in and out as fishhooks, aren&#39;t they?&quot;</p>
<p>Benwick comes in and goes to fix Velvet&#39;s fishing rod.</p>
<p>We&#39;re now in the <strong><em>Van Eltia</em></strong><strong>, Pirate Vessel.</strong></p>
<p>Bienfu&#39;s standing on top of the side of the ship. He mentions Magilou used him as bait &quot;to catch a whale...&quot;</p>
<p>I go inside the cabin.</p>
<p>It looks nice...</p>
<p>One pirate suggests using the cannons to call the therion up.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;You guys are scarier than daemons sometimes.&quot;</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Velvet asks Benwick for her fishing rod back. He&#39;s still fixing it. Velvet&#39;s doubting whether a therion&#39;s around...</p>
<p>Magilou, Rokurou, and Laphicet to talk to next.</p>
<p>Magilou first. She warns Velvet, in her exaggerated way, the dangers of fishing.</p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s second. He&#39;s laughing about &quot;old man Tenny,&quot; Eleanor&#39;s fishing teacher. Tenny tells Eleanor the silliest words he could in order for her to catch a fish, such as &quot;paporo popporo pippity poppity pooh.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Those two look like they&#39;re having fun.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;There&#39;s &#39;Colette collates collections&#39;, and &#39;The butcher metes meat at the meet.&#39; Tenny is a veritable treasure trove of wordplay.&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet thinks Tenny&#39;s silly words are funnier when Eleanor says them.</p>
<p>I read the synopsis. Magilou and Rokurou and Velvet knew that Eleanor was a spy. She&#39;s bad at being one because she&#39;s too honest.</p>
<p>Rokurou challenges Eizen to a fishing battle. Eizen considers fishing a &quot;solitary battle.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Oooh-hooh, aren&#39;t you the philosophical one all of a sudden?&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou, whenever he sees &quot;a good sword,&quot; he can&#39;t help but swing the sword...I&#39;m reminded of Samanosuke from <em>Onimusha</em>. Whenever he gets a new power, he swings the powered-up sword a couple of times...</p>
<p>Eizen and Rokurou, ever the gory ones...</p>
<p>Velvet destroys the mood of any party when she&#39;s around.</p>
<p>But Eizen accepts the challenge.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;At what point did the therion hunt turn into a contest?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Let&#39;s make this interesting! Whoever loses will be the winner&#39;s servant!&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Heh! With Fujibayashi&#39;s Rod in my hands, my chances of defeat are zero! Zilch! You&#39;re going to regret this bet!&quot;</p>
<p>Back to Benwick again. He hands Velvet the fishing rod.</p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s rod got a bite!</p>
<p>Same with Rokurou!</p>
<p>The crew&#39;s anticipating their catch...</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Now!&quot;<br>
<strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;Heeeeave...&quot;</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/jASDWMN.png alt="crew pulls out something" width=480 height=270 id=hd-liveblog></p>
<p>Awww, look at the crew...</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>It&#39;s a treasure chest! Inside are a pair of horns!</p>
<p>Eleanor thinks of having Laphicet try out the pair of horns. Magilou agrees, saying &quot;it&#39;ll bring out his unique personality.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s smiling and fists waving, saying the horns look nice on him...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/P1srW8S.png alt="eleanor jazz hands" width=480 height=270 id=hd-liveblog></p>
<p>Laphicet blushes...</p>
<p>Velvet sulks away, and tells everyone to get back to business. Is the gang trying to make her laugh? But she ignores Laphicet...</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;I have to catch the therion...maybe then Velvet will see me for who I am.&quot; Poor Laphicet.. <img class=emojione alt=☹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Rokurou and Eizen got nothing too.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Who was it who said fishing doesn&#39;t always go how you think it will?&quot;
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Hah, spoken like a true heartless pirate.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor has something though! Another treasure!</p>
<p>Magilou too! More fashion accessories! Oh my goodness, is this the Sea of Fashion?</p>
<p>No fish left.</p>
<p>Laphicet stops his fishing and goes to the deck, boiling inside. Velvet, you should apologize to him.</p>
<p>Then Laphicet pulls off one of the best costume mashups in ages!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Q0c4li2.png alt="laphicet silly outfit" width=480 height=270 id=hd-liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;You don&#39;t take half measures, do ya?&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet looks down.</p>
<p>He&#39;s trying to get older sister Velvet to notice him. Velvet tells him to take it off.</p>
<p>Laphicet finally loses it!</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;<strong>Stop it! What do you know about me anyway? ...All you know is your &#39;Laphi&#39;!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Rokurou notices Velvet&#39;s rod has a bite! Pull it, Velvet!</p>
<p>Oh my god, it&#39;s a big pot!</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> (deadpan) &quot;Yay.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;But what&#39;s a pot doing out here?&quot;<br>
<strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;There&#39;s something inside it.&quot;</p>
<p>Tentacles come out of the pot! They&#39;re nautiloids!</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;I wish they&#39;d stop making those noises!&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Watch out! They&#39;re armed to the squeeth! And they&#39;re shouting &#39;Let squeedom ring!&#39;&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Must you?&quot;</p>
<p>At least that ended quickly!</p>
<p>Velvet tells Laphicet to be more careful.</p>
<p>Laphicet mentions her brother Laphi again, sulking.</p>
<p>Rokurou sees something else in the pot! Zombies crawl out of the pot! What is this pot!?</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Now we gotta fight the shambling dead?!&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;A zombopot!&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;For a bunch of dead guys, they&#39;re awfully, uh, fleshy.&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;For the healthy support of the octopus diet!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Wth is this pot!?&quot; She&#39;s asking the same question I&#39;m asking.</p>
<p>Eizen&#39;s in awe of the pot! He smiles at its quality!</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Listen and behold! This is none other than a water jug made by the potter Grune during King Claudin&#39;s reign. It was a legendary once in a millennium masterpiece...but it was lost...two hundred years ago.&quot;</p>
<p>He mentions the pot&#39;s &quot;stately curves and the subtle shimmer of its colors, which belie a hidden savagery.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s tired of Eizen&#39;s history lectures. So&#39;s Magilou.</p>
<p>Gur anzr Tehar vf sebz <em>Gnyrf bs Yrtraqvn</em>...</p>
<p>He mentions the &quot;lost glazing technique of the Oresoren...&quot; Nabgure <em>Yrtraqvn</em> ersrerapr!</p>
<p>But the pot inside turns malevolent...</p>
<p>It becomes a daemon!</p>
<p>It&#39;s a <strong>Pandora Pot</strong>, weak against earth, but strong against fire and non- elemental artes!</p>
<p>Eizen tells us not to smash the pot!</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;So can I slash it?&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s even worse!&quot; :laugh:</p>
<p>I change up everyone&#39;s arte strategies to focus on the pot&#39;s weakness to earth.</p>
<p>We eventually destroy the pot, and win a <strong>Journeyman Smith&#39;s Acerite</strong>, meaning we can upgrade our weapons even further! Finally!</p>
<p><a name=6></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The pot turns back to normal.</p>
<p>Eizen yells at Velvet not to eat the pot. How&#39;s she going to eat the pot? It&#39;s a pot!</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s disappointed. No therions and no fish.</p>
<p>Magilou points out Eizen&#39;s curse again. Eleanor realizes why they fished out all those treasures...</p>
<p>Poor Laphicet...he couldn&#39;t find any therions at all to help Velvet...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Nope. But I know you&#39;re not the type to give up after a little setback.&quot; She&#39;s trying to cheer him up.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>Isn&#39;t that right, Phi?</strong>&quot; Awww...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>It&#39;s your nickname.</strong> Not a lot of thought put into it, but...<strong>you&#39;re you. You&#39;re Phi.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet smiles. Magilou loves the nickname, pointing out the personality.</p>
<p>Velvet teases him a bit. Laphicet&#39;s not giving up, though. Velvet and Phi smile...awww...</p>
<p>Eizen found something in the pot. <strong>Orichalcum.</strong></p>
<p>This spot was where the ship carrying orichalcum sank...looks like Rokurou&#39;s going to get his new swords!</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Hell yeah! Kurogane might actually be able to make me an orichalcum sword! Nice find, Eizen! You too, Laphicet!&quot;</p>
<p>This whole fishing episode makes for a very good filler. Magilou compliments Laphicet&#39;s costume show earlier. Phi blushes...</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s smiling so warmly. It&#39;s been a long time since that&#39;s happened.</p>
<p>Back at Titania...we take a rest.</p>
<p>We got the Orichalcum, the Water Jug, and the fashion accessories! Along with a recipe for <strong>Takoyaki!</strong> That recipe might have been in the pot!</p>
<p>I put the Horns on Velvet and save at the docks.</p>

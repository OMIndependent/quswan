<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>Next morning, a foggy morning...</p>
<p>Eleanor comes over, and confesses her mission by the Shepherd. So she almost betrayed everyone! Usually in <em>Tales</em> games, there&#39;s a spy or a traitor in the party, lucky this game finally subverts that trope!</p>
<p>She bows in apology.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;<strong>However, I no longer intend on following the Abbey&#39;s orders.</strong>&quot; Oh my god!</p>
<p>But she still thinks the Shepherd means well about the world he&#39;s bringing up, one of &quot;peace.&quot; But she doesn&#39;t agree with his means to get there.</p>
<p>She smiles at Kamoana.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;<strong>I will help you protect the therions.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;<strong>Until I discover the answer I seek. I want to live a life that I don&#39;t have to be ashamed of, and to do that, I have to learn the truth for myself.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou laughs warmly.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;So you live by your emotions after all.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Maybe you&#39;ve found your own creed.&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Welcome to our wonderful world of wickedness!&quot; <del>Better than Disney&#39;s Wonderful World!</del></p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;To act in opposition of one&#39;s feelings is to act opposed to reason!&quot; She blushes as she says this.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;You&#39;re really not making things simple, aren&#39;t you?&quot;<br>
<strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;After all, she&#39;s my vessel.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh Rokurou, your dang smile...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Our next move: to find another therion. Magilou suggests having Eleanor to &quot;swipe&quot; Abbey knowledge.</p>
<p>Velvet thinks Eleanor&#39;s not spy material.</p>
<p>Laphicet wants to check Velvet&#39;s old cell.</p>
<p>More skits...</p>
<p><strong>First skit:</strong> Eleanor apologizes again for deceving Laphicet, but he somehow knew she was leading him there. She&#39;s a very bad spy...when he knows she&#39;s doing something funny, she sweats. Velvet knew it from the very beginning.</p>
<p>Laphicet calls her guilt a good quality, since it shows her honesty.</p>
<p>A wild Bienfu appears! And gets rejected.</p>
<p><strong>Bienfu:</strong> &quot;Madam Eleanor is a meaniehead!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Second:</strong> Laphicet&#39;s amazed at our exploration efforts thus far!</p>
<p>Eizen points out an uncharted island: <strong>Terror Island.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Third skit:</strong> Rokurou asks Bienfu who or what Magilou actually is. Eleanor guesses she&#39;s an exorcist, but she &quot;[never] saw her name in the roster.&quot; Probably Magilou or her long name, is an alias.</p>
<p>Bienfu confirms she&#39;s a witch. Now Bienfu tells about her cauldron.</p>
<p>The twist: She made &quot;strawberry jam&quot; in her cauldron!</p>
<p>But she used wine, soy sauce, and liquor instead of pectin and sugar!</p>
<p>Eleanor calls it strawberry soup. Then Velvet steps in and mentions &quot;strawberry soup&quot; as not having strawberries. Just urchins and abalone.</p>
<p>So Magilou&#39;s a bit of the &quot;lethal chef&quot; in this <em>Tales</em> game.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Fourth:</strong> The History of Fragrant Wood. </p>
<p>Eleanor and Laphicet mention Prince Percival&#39;s trademark fragrant wood perfume.</p>
<p>And Eleanor throws in another <em>Tales</em> reference with &quot;phandaria trees.&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet asks if the three women share the same perfume because they smell the same. It&#39;s the soap.</p>
<p>Laphicet then asks if only the royal family can use fragrant wood. Only a few scents are for royal family only. The regulations on that are a bit lax...</p>
<p>Laphicet asks why not many people use perfume. Eleanor asks Eizen why they don&#39;t. Then Eizen explains about Midgand&#39;s hygiene history. Magilou&#39;s smiling. She knows it. </p>
<p>Eizen&#39;s a real history buff, with Rokurou pitching in some.</p>
<p>Eizen continues about the history of perfume, where now only the rich have it as a sign of their wealth. For a time...then daemonblight or malevolence broke out. And again perfumes were for rich people only.</p>
<p>Eleanor points out the connections between fragrant woods and plagues in history.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;To cover up about the truth of malevolence, the powers that be spread rumors of [daemonblight]...Continuing their [...] tradition of covering up one stink with another.&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet prefers soap better after hearing the troubled history of fragrant woods.</p>
<p><strong>Fifth skit:</strong> Bienfu&#39;s amazed about the hideout! Laphicet&#39;s sad, knowing of the history behind the hideout.</p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s happy about being in Titania now that it&#39;s their &quot;secret fort [he] always dreamed of.&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou mentions a guard eating her <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marron_glac%C3%A9>marrons glaces</a>, or candied chestnuts.</p>
<p>Eizen gets serious and thinks of improving the hideout &quot;to suit the crew&#39;s needs.&quot; I love that idea!</p>
<p>Rokurou suggets smoke screen generators. Laphicet suggests something like a fire extinguisher. But water artes are best, and he has those...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/FzzHMVp.png alt="underground tunnels" width=480 height=270 id=hd-liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;<strong>What we really need are some secret underground tunnels.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet thinks two docks is enough.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;No enemy is going to attack without taking both docks into consideration. That&#39;s why we need underground tunnels before anything else.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet asks where those tunnels would go.</p>
<p>Eizen thinks of digging under the sea. Lol, oh Eizen.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;If it means getting my tunnels, I&#39;ll build an island too.&quot;</p>
<p>Two of the three women really don&#39;t get Eizen&#39;s tunnel idea. Lol...Rokurou&#39;s with him when it comes to impossible dreams. All the boys sigh...</p>

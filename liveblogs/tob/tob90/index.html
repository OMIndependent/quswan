<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;I do hope Kamoana isn&#39;t crying anymore...&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet hopes so too...</p>
<p>Seeing exorcists, Velvet shushes them and the crew runs off to hide.</p>
<p>From citizens, it seems Teresa&#39;s no longer in charge of Hellawes anymore...</p>
<p>There&#39;s looming chaos abound in Hellawes.</p>
<p>The exorcists are only here for a mission: probably for the therion here.</p>
<p><strong>Citizen:</strong> &quot;Surely we&#39;re not being punished by the Abbey for what happened with Medissa are we?&quot; <strong>Medissa?</strong></p>
<p>The exorcists deny that and make their leave.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> (thinking) &quot;So the exorcists are just passing through town and heading straight north...odd.&quot;</p>
<p>There&#39;s no flamestone being shipped either...</p>
<p>A devout man mentions something about &quot;the Calamity.&quot; He mentions &quot;the Calamity,&quot; or Velvet herself, wreaking havoc on Hellawes. Another mentions that the Calamity&#39;s been happening everywhere.</p>
<p>The malevolence is spreading in Hellawes too, huh?</p>
<p>Magilou wonders where the exorcists are in times like these...</p>
<p>So Teresa got demoted for her failure to stop &quot;the Calamity,&quot; huh?</p>
<p>The Abbey&#39;s now headed north because of the therion there for some reason, and the citizens blame Medissa. Who&#39;s Medissa? They don&#39;t tell us...</p>
<p>Eizen suggests asking around town.</p>
<p>Rokurou asks Velvet why she&#39;s curious about Medissa. She thinks she might be an important person.</p>
<p>Magilou asks Velvet if she&#39;s going to find out about this Calamity person, calling her &quot;a real terror.&quot;</p>
<p>The Calamity <strong>is</strong> Velvet, Magilou.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Yeah, I think I&#39;ll pass. I know plenty about what makes her tick.&quot;</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Skit:</strong> Bienfu tries to comfort Eleanor, but Eleanor won&#39;t have it. Thanks to the efforts of Dyle, Rokurou, Magilou, and Velvet, all of Hellawes has broken loose...</p>
<p>Magilou thinks the town deserves it though, after getting rich easily from the flamestone trade...</p>
<p>Eizen explains the history of Hellawes as a small fishing village. Eleanor goes on to mention global cooling again. Laphicet mentions the benefits of the fish from the freezing cold.</p>
<p>Laphicet thinks he&#39;s &quot;overindulging&quot; in his appetite. Rokurou reassures him that&#39;s just Laphicet getting healthy. Eizen asks that he&#39;ll have Benwick get some fish and octopi for Phi.</p>
<p>Another <strong>skit:</strong> <strong>A Calamity Twice Over.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;This &#39;calamity&#39; is us, isn&#39;t it?&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Well, we&#39;ve been waging war with the Abbey everywhere we go. And now we&#39;re about to take it to a new level.&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen mentions if we free the therion here, this is going to turn into a repeat of Southgand.</p>
<p>Magilou smirks, thinking of what the people will call this event. Eleanor tells her to be serious!</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;People turn into daemons in part due to their own malevolence. It&#39;s not like they&#39;re entirely innocent.&quot; So says you, Rokurou.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;But if there&#39;s someone out there who&#39;s being forced to act as Innominat&#39;s mouth, like Kamoana was, isn&#39;t saving them the right thing to do?&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet says she&#39;ll do the job &quot;that needs to be done.&quot;</p>
<p>Inside the storehouse, Eleanor reminds us of our mission.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;I&#39;d like to stay indoors next to a warm fireplace for the next few weeks, if possible.&quot;</p>
<p>Rumors are spreading about our exploits in Vortigern and our &quot;kidnapping&quot; of Prince Percival.</p>
<p>After reading the guide, I suddenly realize something! Since we have a geoboard, we could cross the gaps in the areas we couldn&#39;t cross...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>After saving, I sail to Reneed and head for the wetland.</p>
<p>Somehow I have a <strong>skit</strong> to play, where Eleanor mentions that Hellawes has changed. So has she, Magilou points out.</p>
<p>Eleanor never expected to join the crew. And Phi couldn&#39;t even think at all back then... <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Plus, Dyle is proudly with Aifread&#39;s crew.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Even restless Bienfu and Grimoirh are now part of our merry band.&quot;<br>
<strong>Bienfu:</strong> &quot;Yep!&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou points out herself. She has not changed.</p>
<p>Phi points out the Prince, Griffin, Kurogane, and Kamoana as part of the crew.</p>
<p>But whatever the crew says about her, Magilou lets it slide.</p>
<p>Magilou slumps in defeat...</p>
<p>Now to activate the geotree in Reneed and in Nog...</p>
<p>I now use the geoboard to cross to the unreachable island in the marsh.</p>
<p>Whoa! What a jump!</p>
<p>Now back to Northgand!</p>
<p>Fishermen are arguing that they need to help the shipping guild. A merchant&#39;s angry that he&#39;s lost his money thanks to the raid...</p>
<p>I check our map. Oh my god, there&#39;s a lot of stars here! We also have optional sidequests now.</p>
<p>I decide to talk to the townspeople for more info.</p>
<p>Eleanor uses her exorcist status and becomes the inquiry board for the citizenry. She asks from a woman about the state of Hellawes.</p>
<p>The people still want Teresa back.</p>
<p>The exorcists are now probably more concerned about the therion than the city.</p>
<p>Looks like the city&#39;s slowly realizing that they can&#39;t rely on the Abbey...</p>
<p>There&#39;s also another believer now subtly doubting the case of what causes daemonblight.</p>
<p>She mentions a village in Eastgand &quot;where everyone caught it at once.&quot; Oh no...Velvet reacts a bit.</p>
<p>She&#39;s still hoping for a cure, though...</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Inside the sanctuary now...</p>
<p>A newlywed wife complains about the destruction of the town mentioning how her husband had to go to Loegres to get money.</p>
<p>A townsperson&#39;s praying for a daemon&#39;s death...eee...</p>
<p>An elderly man knew Medissa. He&#39;s her neighbor. Medissa&#39;s a single mother. But then, exorcists took care of her daughter Diana after she got malevolent...no...</p>
<p>Even Eleanor sees how cruel that was.</p>
<p>So Medissa&#39;s like Velvet in a way. She locked the Sanctuary with her inside.</p>
<p>The old man mentions that she screamed: &quot;Daemons have feelings too!&quot;</p>
<p>But an exorcist spared her life, and told a guard that Medissa is &quot;receptive.&quot; So probably Medissa&#39;s the therion...</p>
<p>He tells us he thinks it&#39;s because Medissa was very religious to the Abbey.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> (sarcastically) &quot;That was certainly kind of them.&quot;</p>
<p>Medissa loved Diana so much...the old man mentions the Abbey&#39;s &quot;devotion&quot; to reason and logic.</p>
<p>The elderly man is pretty savvy.</p>
<p>Another woman tells us about Faldies Ruins, a checkpoint to Mt. Killaraus.</p>
<p>She mentions Faldies Ruins &quot;as a prison camp&quot; too. Eeeee...</p>
<p>The prisoners are human. The woman mentions Medissa and her sanctuary moment.</p>
<p>Velvet asks why the Abbey would use Faldies Ruins as a prison for.</p>
<p>The woman mentions that these are all rumors though...hmmm...</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>One citizen thinks the Shepherd has a plan.</p>
<p>Inside the bar, one youth mentions the flaws of Teresa&#39;s overseeing of Hellawes. He blames her for not taking care of Velvet and the crew the last time we were here...he mentions he&#39;s joking!</p>
<p>A Bloodwing agent near the bar has a new job for us: the <strong>Managarmr!</strong></p>
<p>A woman upstairs sort of sympathizes with Medissa&#39;s plight.</p>
<p>Her daughter tells her that they need to &quot;stick to reason.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet understand the mother&#39;s feelings a bit...</p>
<p>I get to another promoter downstairs for Magilou&#39;s show...</p>
<p>Magilou and Laphicet now have their comedy skit...</p>
<p>Magilou gives Phi instructions on how to do the show before starting. Phi admits he&#39;s not good at ad-libbing.</p>
<p>Phi&#39;s not afraid to fail. Awww...</p>
<p>Phi confesses to the audience that Magilou wrote everything.</p>
<p>The Teresa admirer&#39;s not looking so happy either...he misses &quot;Lady Teresa!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;Woooow.&quot; That&#39;s my reaction too.</p>
<p>The promoter&#39;s got hopes for Phi&#39;s talent.</p>
<p>In the inn now...</p>

<p></p><h2 class=entry-title>Tales of Berseria - Part 90a: Words and Deeds of the Hero King</h2><p></p>

<p>We see a book called &quot;Words and Deeds of the Hero King.&quot;</p>
<p>The king who wrote this mentions to his citizens about reason.</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Man can turn reason into disorder, but also can we surpass it. Our true power is in transcending the possible to achieve the ideal.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s a hopeful address.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Transcending the possible...to achieve the ideal...&quot;</p>
<p>Another flashback to <strong>that man</strong> and Seres in Aball...</p>
<p>Seres tells <strong>that man</strong> that she&#39;s &quot;processed documents&quot; from his &quot;predecessor&quot; Claudin.</p>
<p><strong>Seres:</strong> &quot;However, I conclude that for the time being it is impossible to form pacts with all four Empyreans.&quot;<br>
<strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;As I feared, not even my predecessor could achieve more than two. I suppose using the fifth Empyrean is my only option.&quot;</p>
<p>Seres questions him.</p>
<p><strong>Seres:</strong> &quot;Doing so would require...&quot;<br>
<strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;I will do whatever needs to be done.&quot; Oh god...</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;I betrayed my teacher. I betrayed the mission he gave his life for, that he entrusted in my hands. For a time, I thought I could bear the weight of my sins and go on living...with Celica by my side... But now she&#39;s gone...&quot;</p>
<p>He quotes from the &quot;Words and Deeds of the Hero King.&quot;</p>
<p>So this is the Shepherd&#39;s MO: an &quot;ideal world.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;I couldn&#39;t protect the people I loved, but this at least I will accomplish...&quot;</p>
<p>A younger Velvet comes by and asks who her teacher was talking to. He denies talking to someone.</p>
<p>Phi thought the address by the king &quot;kinda [sounded] nice.&quot; On paper...</p>
<p>Velvet lies, saying it&#39;s a bit of a thick volume.</p>
<p>And with that, I&#39;ve reached skit 250!</p>

<p></p><h2 class=entry-title>Tales of Berseria - Part 90: Return to Northgand At Long Last (continued)</h2><p></p>

<p>Final person to talk to: he mentions Diana becoming malevolent, and the exorcists taking care of her.</p>
<p>So Medissa hid Diana from the exorcists, huh?</p>
<p>The believer tells us again to not let emotions get in the way.</p>
<p>Then a citizen told the exorcists about Diana. The citizen was Medissa&#39;s fiancee! So she killed him after he reported about Diana.</p>
<p>But Diana didn&#39;t like the fiancee, or rather, she did not want her mother to remarry.</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s shocked by the news!</p>
<p>And the citizen victim-blames Diana.</p>
<p>Velvet now sums up all the clues we have about Medissa, Diana, and the Faldies Ruins.</p>
<p>Laphicet compares that case to Kamoana&#39;s...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;What I&#39;m curious about is the use of the word &#39;receptive&#39; to describe Medissa.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;&#39;So long as there is one <strong>receptive</strong> to divine power, therions shall be forever reborn.&#39; If our interpretation of that [...] book is right, it likely means she&#39;s receptive to Innominat&#39;s power.&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Meaning they brought Medissa to those ruins where there&#39;s an earthpulse point, and then they made her into a therion.&quot;</p>
<p>Everyone&#39;s now realizing that Medissa&#39;s the next therion they&#39;re looking for...</p>
<p>Magilou points out the benefits of having Medissa around now that she has bones to pick with the Abbey.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Although that sounds almost too easy. Did I jinx it? I just jinxed it, didn&#39;t I?&quot;</p>
<p>So our next stop is the ruins.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;And don&#39;t worry. You <strong>totally</strong> jinxed it.&quot;</p>
<p>Looks like the crew owes Rokurou a soda now, or a drink...</p>
<p>The soldier at the gates tells us complaining is against reason. No, it&#39;s finding reason.</p>
<p><a name=7></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Poor Phi...he&#39;s now feeling the cold of Northgand...</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;I think having my awareness controlled meant my senses were dulled as well.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor points out the cold&#39;s not affecting Eizen, or the rest of the crew...</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;If you shiver at these temperatures, you&#39;ll never make it on the high seas.&quot; What a sailor!<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;In my youth, I practiced the blade under the blazing sun and through raging blizzards. Besides, when I turned into a daemon, extreme temperatures ceased to affect me.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s not a fan of winter, but now that she&#39;s a daemon, temperatures don&#39;t affect her too. She smirks at that perk.</p>
<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> (spoilers for <em>Vesperia</em>) Vs Lhev jrer urer evtug abj, ur&#39;q or fuvirevat ng guvf jrngure...</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s also feeling the chill.</p>
<p>Magilou has a &quot;secret weapon&quot; to fight the cold: hand warmers! She&#39;ll share, if Eleanor &quot;acts like a dove.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Please share your [...] warmers with me! Coo coo...&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;You&#39;re no Velvet, that&#39;s for sure.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s reaction:</p>

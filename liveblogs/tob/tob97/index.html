<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>Everyone inside the hideout&#39;s got something new to say.</p>
<p>Eleanor compliments the pirates&#39; work ethic. Laphicet&#39;s curious about what&#39;s under Bienfu&#39;s hat. Magilou and Rokurou ask about their manners of speaking.</p>
<p>Medissa judges Dyle.</p>
<p><strong>Skit:</strong> Kamoana asks Laphicet about Dyle. Phi points out Dyle looks like &quot;Ymir monitor lizard&quot; at a glance. Dyle jumps in.</p>
<p>Another pirate tells us about another Class 4 Zone, filled with bird enemies!</p>
<p>The pirates have &quot;Aifrecise&quot;s instead of exercises! 99 of them!</p>
<p>Dyle&#39;s the head of the hideout, even though Velvet points out he&#39;s a navigator, someone has to look after the hideout.</p>
<p>After Velvet got Dyle&#39;s tail, he&#39;s lost his balance a bit, and thinks overseeing the hideout&#39;s a slightly better job for him.</p>
<p>Velvet thinks he&#39;s lying.</p>
<p>We travel to the Class 4 Zone first. It&#39;s near Northgand, making the place pretty chilly.</p>
<p>I free the Katz and set sail for Taliesin.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a long boat ride there.</p>
<p>Another dream: Velvet&#39;s holding an apple while looking at windows. She bites the apple. It tastes sour.</p>
<p><strong>Seres:</strong> &quot;So you&#39;ve kept your sense of taste?&quot; Huh? I thought she lost that.<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;In my dreams I have. Nowhere else.&quot;<br>
<strong>Seres:</strong> &quot;Does that make this a dream?&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;It would have to be wouldn&#39;t it? After all...I devoured you.&quot;</p>
<p>Seres tells her not to forget it.</p>
<p>Velvet crushes the apple!</p>
<p>She wakes up!</p>
<p>She looks at her arm.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The <em>Van Eltia</em>&#39;s traveling through thick fog...</p>
<p>Velvet tells Eleanor one thing: &quot;Laphicet is not &#39;your little malak.&#39;&quot; Exactly.</p>
<p>Eleanor also says the same thing to her.</p>
<p>At least both of them agree on Laphicet&#39;s personhood. Eleanor&#39;s trying to learn that.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;You&#39;re right. Malakhim aren&#39;t just tools to be used by exorcists as they please.&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou reminds Velvet about their bet from the Ravine. Yikes! I almost forgot that. Velvet hasn&#39;t, though.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;A word of caution! <strong>People can fight against pain, but they can&#39;t fight against happiness.</strong>&quot; Yikes! She sounds like Edel here.</p>
<p>Magilou advises Velvet to dream good dreams. Velvet can&#39;t. She always has nightmares.</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s relieved the ship made it past the fog. Eizen feels offended.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Who do you think runs this ship?&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;A bunch of shameless rogues who are <strong>very good</strong> at shameless roguery.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> (smiles) &quot;Damn straight.&quot;</p>
<p>Benwick points out the lack of fog in Taliesin. Must be because of the windmills keeping it out....</p>
<p>Now we make it to <strong>Taliesin, Cliff City of the East</strong>.</p>
<p>Pirates are telling kids near the port about the awesomeness of the <em>Van Valvali</em>. One pirate gave away their secret, that that&#39;s not the ship&#39;s real name. Or did he?</p>
<p>There&#39;s a lot of cats in Taliesin.</p>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/Pba-0fv3WA8>The music sounds nice</a>.</p>
<p>Past the stairs and the double doors...</p>
<p>Phi&#39;s the first to run up more stairs. He compares the city to a castle. There&#39;s lots of stairs and steep cliff estate here.</p>
<p>Velvet explains the history of Taliesin. It was originally a &quot;rich trading family&#39;s&quot; HQ.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;But even so, to us, it was the big city of our dreams.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor points out Velvet&#39;s knowledge of Taliesin. Of course. Velvet explains that she grew up in Aball. What will she find there?</p>
<p>The therion&#39;s probably near the ruin past the Tranquil Woods there, or in Aball.</p>
<p>Velvet points out no one&#39;s going to notice her.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Everyone I knew...I already devoured.&quot; Oh god...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We go down stairs and into a tavern. A Bloodwing agent gives us three new code reds to find.</p>
<p>Outside, we do a lot of weapon customization at the shop nearby. My lord, we&#39;ve got a lot of equipment!</p>
<p>There&#39;s <strong>Grape Gel</strong>s being sold there too! The stakes of this game are getting higher!</p>
<p>As we go up to higher ground, there&#39;s a person who mentions a name I haven&#39;t heard since the beginning of this playthrough: <strong>Niko!</strong></p>
<p>Velvet gasps.</p>
<p><strong>Man:</strong> &quot;I heard she doesn&#39;t want to leave the village because she&#39;s waiting for her missing friend to return.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet yells to him that Aball&#39;s in ruins!</p>
<p>The townsfolk give credit to the Shepherd for Aball&#39;s survival.</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s in shock!</p>
<p>It feels like Nibelheim all over again...this feels really unsettling.</p>
<p><strong>Skit:</strong> Eleanor and Phi mention Aball. She asks if there were settlers that moved in. Phi points out about Niko.</p>
<p>Rokurou asks about the earthpulse point near Aball.</p>
<p>Bienfu doesn&#39;t feel right...</p>
<p>Magilou suggests going forward.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s what I&#39;d like to know.&quot;</p>
<p>One woman points out about the Shepherd being from Eastgand, and his quest that started...by sacrificing Velvet&#39;s brother.</p>
<p>Climbing ladders, there&#39;s a wide gap that&#39;s geoboard-crossable.</p>
<p>We find another Character Cards player, Takeshi, or Yuto, sitting on a bridge...</p>
<p>After two games, I find and activate the geotree and head down to free the Katz here! We get a <strong>Water Normin Set</strong> for Magilou!</p>
<p>We talk to a man who&#39;s lucky that the fog didn&#39;t last long. Phi&#39;s lucky no daemons were around in the fog.</p>
<p>The man thanks the Shepherd (again) for saving Eastgand from daemons. There&#39;s no daemon attacks in Eastgand after the Advent.</p>
<p>The daemons don&#39;t attack the settlements in this continent, but they&#39;re outside of town.</p>
<p>He mentions &quot;the Shepherd&#39;s power lingers&quot; in this continent.</p>
<p>Velvet has the same question that I do: <strong>Why are daemons avoiding the towns?</strong></p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The inn here looks nice.</p>
<p>Inside the sanctuary, where a woman tells a girl about Lake Perniya, and the Holy Kingdom of Hyland sunk beneath the lake. It was a prosperous town, until dragons flooded the kingdom...</p>
<p>The soldiers and priest compliment each other for another peace.</p>
<p>The merchant warns us about <strong>Perniya Cliffside Path</strong> and <strong>Morgana Woods</strong>. Velvet knows about the places here, but he&#39;s probably talking to me.</p>
<p>Next to him is the first sign that we&#39;re in Eastgand: autumn trees.</p>
<p>A vet near the exit&#39;s looking for a cat.</p>
<p>A believer asks about the condition of daemonblight in other places. Magilou exaggerates again. The woman mentions there were no daemon attacks in town for three years. What the heck?</p>
<p>The only thing that&#39;s changed in the continent is the prickleboar meat. It&#39;s more tastier.</p>
<p>Velvet points out everything&#39;s the same as ever.</p>
<p>Eizen correctly assumes there&#39;s a therion in this continent.</p>
<p>No exorcists in Eastgand at all. It&#39;s a squeaky clean continent. Phi asks about where the exorcists in Eastgand are currently at. Still in Northgand...</p>
<p>The man also tells us secretly that if the daemons were gone, it&#39;s only the exorcists that would be intimidating or something. He&#39;s onto something here. </p>
<p>At the entrance of town there&#39;s a Katz with another geoboard minigame: <strong>Flag Fetcher!</strong></p>
<p>An old man tending his potted plants mentions Taliesin&#39;s claim to fame, the stairs. Surprisingly, he sees nothing wrong with the stairs.</p>
<p>He mentions the people of this town has &quot;strong legs and [a] sturdy back.&quot;</p>
<p>A brother and sister talk about &quot;a festival in Aball.&quot;</p>
<p>Niko&#39;s namedropped again...she&#39;s being hailed as a great chef for her &quot;masterquiches&quot;.</p>
<p>They have to prepare for their town&#39;s fish festival soon.</p>

<p>We wander around the cave some more to scavenge for some more materials...</p>
<p>I&#39;m dodging and weaving past monsters...</p>
<p>One villager in Beardsley doesn&#39;t want anything to do with what happened in the Hollow.</p>
<p>The Apple Girl&#39;s looking for a Fortune Apple...</p>
<p>I sell more raw materials, buy more stuff, and rest up before doing more level grinding outside...</p>
<p>After switching formation, I immediately get pointers on Rokurou&#39;s Break Soul arte: <strong>Vengeful Stance</strong>...</p>
<p>More battles to go through...</p>
<p>There&#39;s still merchants outside the gates of the city...</p>
<p>I head back one area to the cold shores of the icecaps to add more battles in the bag...</p>
<p>I save back at the ladder to the storehouse.</p>
<p>In the storehouse, we pick up some olive oil...</p>
<p>I wonder where we can get more cooking recipes?</p>

<hr>
<p>Back in the city proper, we speak to a young woman who&#39;s &quot;lucky the snow&#39;s been white.&quot; Velvet thinks she&#39;s stating the obvious. But in Hellawes, snow isn&#39;t always white...the woman says that ash from a nearby volcano turns that snow gray...uh oh...</p>
<p>The volcano, <strong>Mt. Killaraus</strong>, causes that gray snow, and according to the woman, it&#39;s the biggest volcano in Midgand. It&#39;s north of Hellawes, and is the only source of flamestone...</p>
<p>Rokurou asks curiously to Velvet if she&#39;s ever seen a volcano.</p>
<p>Velvet hasn&#39;t seen one, and as usual, doesn&#39;t care.</p>
<p>The young woman mentions cleaning the snow off of the roof is a pain...</p>
<p>It seems that I missed a chest in the city. It has an Amber Fragment.</p>
<p>We show Dyle&#39;s tail to the guildmaster.</p>
<p>Velvet says that Dyle&#39;s body was found in a tar lake, and says that the tail was the only piece of proof.</p>
<p>But the guild can&#39;t continue unless Lady Teresa&#39;s given her consent to open business again. Ay, the red tape!</p>
<p>Velvet then blackmails them by threatening to tell them who the actual smugglers are: them.</p>
<p>The guildmaster agrees to have the guild rebuild their ship.</p>
<p>Rokurou suggests to Velvet in upgrading their equipment. She&#39;s not used to that idea. Rokurou then gets going to the weapon shop.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;H-Hey, you don&#39;t need to be so pushy!&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s just how I am. Get used to it. Come on.&quot; He smiles warmly.</p>
<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> (ciphered for personal stuff) Ur fbeg bs erzvaqrq zr bs bar bs zl eryngvirf jura ur qvq gung &quot;chful&quot; orunivbe...</p>

<p>We can now customize our equipment at shops, yes!</p>
<p>I&#39;m now given a tutorial on how to upgrade weapons, in this case, it&#39;s Velvet&#39;s Blood Blade.</p>
<p>All I just need are the required materials and the money to upgrade...for this first time, it&#39;s free...</p>
<p>...and I&#39;m set!</p>
<p>This weapons system reminds me a bit like <strong>Dark Cloud</strong>&#39;s system. But unlike that game, weapons don&#39;t break here.</p>
<p>The amount of upgrades I can make on a weapon depends on the type of &quot;Acerite&quot; I have.</p>
<p>I can also dismantle weapons in order to get better materials for upgrading weapons...</p>
<p>I&#39;m now told to dismantle the already upgraded Blood Blade...</p>
<p>...and I get back raw materials!</p>
<p>Velvet calls it &quot;kind of a hassle.&quot; I agree. She also calls it useful.</p>
<p>I go back and do the whole enhance-and-dismantle weapon system again for real with the Blood Blade...</p>
<p>...I dismantle our extra weapons, and we&#39;re set!</p>
<p>The guild&#39;s slowly spreading the news about Dyle&#39;s &quot;death.&quot; One of them feels sorry for him...</p>
<p>We go back down the ladder...</p>
<p>They&#39;re now going to have the ship fixed. Rokurou though, thinks they need a proper crew to sail the ship, and wonders if there are &quot;any free sailors around.&quot;</p>
<p>I engage in more battles and weapon customization in the village before heading to the shore...</p>

<p><strong>Expedition check:</strong> We get some Fake Food, or a model of prepped food...</p>
<p>Holy heck!</p>
<p>The temple&#39;s infested with daemons, no, monster malakhim!</p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s questioning why the Shepherd would want his Abbey HQ somewhere isolated instead of in the capital.</p>
<p>Laphicet looks around. He senses something. Eizen does too. They both sense &quot;powerful energy flowing underground.&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen explains they&#39;re in a &quot;focal point of the <strong>earthpulse</strong>,&quot; or, where the &quot;source of natural energy&quot; lies. I&#39;m guessing this is why the Shepherd wanted to build the temple here.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Meanwhile, the Shepherd&#39;s praying, or meditating before Innominat&#39;s throne.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/5waK9lS.png alt="eleanor enters" width=480 height=270 id=hd-liveblog></p>
<p>Eleanor enters the room, about to tell him what happened at the Loegres villa.</p>
<p>This feels like a scene from <strong>Return of the Jedi</strong>, except everyone&#39;s clothed in purity instead of gloomy darkness.</p>
<p>The Shepherd asks Eleanor where her malakhim are. Uh oh.</p>
<p>He knows Velvet&#39;s coming.</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s shocked that he knows her.</p>
<p>Eleanor requests for more malakhim to stop Velvet.</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;You are overcome with emotion. Will you fight a daemon with your hatred?&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor backs away, asking for forgiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;She broke even the resolve of even an exemplary disciple like you.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor now asks about the griffin in the villa.</p>
<p>The Shepherd tells her only legates are allowed to enter the griffin daemon&#39;s lair.</p>
<p>Eleanor questions more.</p>
<p>The Shepherd now asks the same question he asked Velvet in the start of the game: &quot;<strong>Why is it you think that birds fly?</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor answers wrong. To &quot;hunt and catch prey&quot; is not the answer.</p>
<p>He dismisses her, stating to Eleanor &quot;that knowledge is not for you.&quot;</p>
<p>The seal above the throne glows white.</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;So Velvet is coming. <strong>The ties that bind us must at last be severed.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Back at the entrance, Magilou wonders about Zaveid. Bienfu sensed that he fled. Rokurou asks how Zaveid knew Aifread.</p>
<p>Laphicet mentions Zaveid&#39;s weapon. Rokurou also states Eizen was looking for someone who had that.</p>
<p>Bienfu doesn&#39;t think Zaveid&#39;s a killer, though. He&#39;s right, he just loves fighting people.</p>
<p>Laphicet sensed no ill will in him either. So does Rokurou.</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s going to fight him if they ever run into him again. Bienfu notes &quot;that&#39;s what a killer looks like.&quot;</p>
<p>There&#39;s a huge barrier in front of the temple. How am I going to break that?</p>
<p>I head to a small platform where an intricate-looking key is floating. I check the key, which sinks into the platform, opening our way through!</p>
<p>It seems like we&#39;ve disabled their security system.</p>
<p>We fight one of the giant white and gold boars, which are armored <strong>Varaha</strong>s! Easy win!</p>
<p>I get more pointers on the Burn status after figting Primal Pythons!</p>
<p>This temple is very colossal...</p>
<p>Climbing up a ladder...we face off more monsters for XP, and the new one here&#39;s a <strong>Delusory Rodent</strong>!</p>
<p>After getting what&#39;s in the nearby silver chest, I jump down! What a long drop!</p>
<p>After a few battles, I head to the center of the temple, where a save point is!</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>More scavenging, and I climb up to the east wing of the temple to a large patch of land...</p>
<p>I open a chest behind a boulder, and head around the structure. I see another chest from afar...along with another security switch under a structure of columns.</p>
<p>But I face another Primal Python, and realize that even my allies can also switch places too, noticing Eizen&#39;s in the fray now unleashing his Mystic Arte!</p>
<p>More battling...</p>
<p>There&#39;s a lot of Tales Coins spread around the temple grounds...</p>
<p>We make it to the second security key. I disable the system here.</p>
<p>The barrier at the top of the temple&#39;s now gone, or at least, one part of it...</p>
<p>We lower the ladder on the eastern end...</p>
<p>I take whatever&#39;s in the silver chest and jump down to the garden below.</p>
<p>I&#39;m sorry for stating the obvious, but this temple <strong>is</strong> really colossal.</p>
<p>After checking the map, I&#39;ll need to disable the western key as well.</p>
<p>I climb the ladder back up to the western structure.</p>
<p>After another battle, we pull down the second ladder, and head for the key.</p>
<p>The last barrier&#39;s out!</p>
<p>The way to the throne is open!</p>
<p>Magilou &quot;prays&quot; they don&#39;t turn the security back on again. Velvet don&#39;t need prayer though.</p>
<p>We jump off the western structure and dash to the save point.</p>
<p>We climb the first set of huge stairs, and scavenge for more items. I&#39;m nervous now...</p>
<p>There&#39;s a lot of materials scattered around the second set of stairs...</p>
<p>Heading to the east end, I open another gold chest where a new weapon: a <strong>Shell Shredder</strong> is!</p>
<p>I switch leader back to Velvet, and stop here.</p>

<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>Let&#39;s see what&#39;s here...</p>
<p>The same enemies from Lake Perniya are also here.</p>
<p>The northmost part of the first area&#39;s got a chest containing a pair of boots!</p>
<p>I proceed eastward, but I notice a shortcut I can take with the geoboard, but we haven&#39;t activated the geotree for this forest yet.</p>
<p>There&#39;s also a new enemy here, a one-eyed troll, or a <strong>Cyclopz</strong>! They&#39;re easy to take care of while battling as Velvet because of their weakness to fire!</p>
<p>In the next vast area of the wood now...</p>
<p>There&#39;s plenty of enemies wandering around.</p>
<p>I spot Katz spirits and a chest containing a <strong>Quartz Doll</strong> for Magilou!</p>
<p>The third area of the woods has more enemies north, and a save point before the east path.</p>
<p>As we make our way through the east road, we hear someone screaming!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Velvet recognizes the voice! Could it be Niko?</p>
<p>Oh my god, it&#39;s her! What&#39;s happened?! What&#39;s going on here?</p>
<p>There&#39;s a huge flying mantis, and it drops down!</p>
<p>It&#39;s a <strong>Xeno Mantis!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;What&#39;s going on? How can Niko be here?&quot;</p>
<p>The Xeno Mantis charges at Velvet, but we dodge the move!</p>
<p>The Xeno Mantis also has sweeping claw attacks and other moves at its disposal, including artes like Air Thrust and Grave!</p>
<p>After a long battle, we finally finish off the Xeno Mantis!</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;I can&#39;t believe it! Is it really you?&quot;</p>
<p>Niko wakes, she sees Velvet too!</p>
<p>Velvet pulls her blade on her!</p>
<p>Velvet asks why she&#39;s alive! Niko same.</p>
<p>So the whole village thought she was &quot;eaten by a daemon.&quot; But Niko knows Velvet&#39;s stronger than that. She cries.</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s also in shock! She hugs her, crying!</p>
<p><strong>What is going on here?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Niko:</strong> &quot;I have to let everyone know the good news! You&#39;ve finally come back to us!&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>Niko&#39;s alive. She&#39;s alive.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen gets cautious, reciting the oft-used George Lucas line, knowing this might be a trap.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Well, naturally, we&#39;ve got a reaper with us!&quot;</p>
<p>Phi suggests asking around in Aball.</p>
<p>Eizen asks Velvet if the villagers did perish by her hand under the Scarlet Night.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Well, it&#39;s...it&#39;s not like I had time to check...&quot;</p>
<p>Everyone in the party&#39;s at level 40 now...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Great, there&#39;s more land to cover in the eastern part of the woods!</p>
<p>There&#39;s more diverging paths as well here.</p>
<p>In the north, we find more Katz spirits and a bronze chest. We turn back...</p>
<p>Another Katz box is located in the midpoint of this area.</p>
<p>I check the south road.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a fleet of enemies in this part!</p>
<p>We find another gap that we can cross via geoboard!</p>
<p>I double back to get to that side, where I find more Katz spirits and another chest.</p>
<p>It seems I have enough spirits to open the Katz box here!</p>
<p>Now heading in the central path...</p>
<p>Velvet still can&#39;t believe what&#39;s going on...even I can&#39;t believe what&#39;s going on!</p>
<p>Phi&#39;s worried about Velvet.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;I know I&#39;m right. I&#39;m sure of it. This isn&#39;t how the village should be.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor tells Velvet to keep calm and suggests investigating around once we get there.</p>
<p>This does feel a lot like Nibelheim all over again...</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s reassuring Eleanor, or more likely, herself, that she&#39;s fine.</p>
<p>Rokurou sees nothing to the contrary that that&#39;s a fake Niko.</p>
<p>Eizen senses something different, &quot;unnatural&quot; as well.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>In the next area, turning a corner east to a dead end, we activate a geotree!</p>
<p>This is the last area of the forest before the entrance gates to Aball...</p>
<p>I use the geoboard to jump the gap opposite where the geotree is...</p>
<p>...leading into the code red daemon&#39;s den!</p>
<p>My lord, look at the size of the code red daemon! It&#39;s a huge boar, no, the daemon&#39;s a <strong>Behemoth!</strong></p>
<p>The Behemoth has such a high defense that it takes a long time to beat him!</p>
<p>I geoboard through the rest of the area...</p>
<p>Here we are back in a familiar entrance...</p>
<p>...except there&#39;s enemies roaming about the woods now.</p>
<p>The gate to Aball looks a bit different, or is it just me?</p>
<p>I stop here for tonight.</p>

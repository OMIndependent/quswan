<p>Let&#39;s get out of this island prison!</p>
<p>An actual save point was just straight ahead of where I left off!</p>
<p>Now there&#39;s two ways to go...but where is the way to the ship?</p>
<p>After saving at the point, we head west where we see a glowing, flaming, floating ball. Seres says it&#39;s a &quot;special mass of mana,&quot; or the &quot;souls of the family of malakhim.&quot;</p>
<p>So if we collect a certain number of these masses, we might get a malak family to help us...</p>
<p>Velvet still doesn&#39;t trust Seres. She takes it anyway, using anything and everything for her revenge. For some reason, she reacts as Seles says &quot;revenge.&quot;</p>
<p>Turning around, the east corridor is locked...</p>
<p>After saving again, I equip the Resist Ring for Velvet before moving forward.</p>
<p>More stairs to climb...</p>
<p><strong>Seres:</strong> &quot;Guards coming. Two of them.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet and Seres hide.</p>
<p>The guards note that the path around the island has gotten weak and might collapse. No escape now.</p>
<p>But there&#39;s another path to the docks, under the watchtower...</p>
<p>A third guard hurries to alert the others that guards are missing.</p>
<p>Now the real challenge begins! The guards split up!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Velvet&#39;s now thinking of freeing other prisoners in order to combat the guards. Most of the prisoners are on the floor they&#39;re at.</p>
<p>We try the west path. Can&#39;t go that way...</p>
<p>On the east, all the doors are locked save for one.</p>
<p>There&#39;s now two more guards: a <strong>Spear Orderly</strong> and a bigger <strong>Prison Guard!</strong></p>
<p>We do an enemy switching tutorial.</p>
<p>We take care of them, but now there&#39;s three cells...Velvet inspects each passage. Most of them are daemons, others are human.</p>
<p>Velvet calls to everyone that she&#39;s opening every cell! Oh my god!</p>
<p>The prisoners&#39; reactions range from disbelief to doubt.</p>
<p>One of them mentions a Van Aifread (another <em>Tales</em> reference!) who broke out of Titania, with help from Melchior, an exorcist.</p>
<p>Velvet tells them that she&#39;s not forcing them to leave. The prisoners decide to go with her.</p>
<p>Seres opens the seals!</p>
<p>Now the prisoners are out, as distraction for the guards.</p>
<p>Two prisoners are trying to debate whether to stay or go.</p>
<p>There&#39;s even an imprisoned zombie sitting in his cell...</p>
<p>Two daemon prisoners and a human prisoner aren&#39;t falling for the escape...</p>
<p>Thereâ€™s even a goblin sitting in his cell, telling us not to underestimate exorcists.</p>
<p>Velvet asks him more about the &quot;amazing&quot; Abbey. The goblin mentions the Abbey&#39;s teamed up with Midgand, where they now own the whole world. He continues by saying that any human that becomes a daemon is hunted.</p>
<p>Anyone who got into Titania were &quot;the lucky ones.&quot;</p>
<p>And even if we did manage to escape, the exorcists with their malakhim sidekicks are waiting at the exit... oh god...</p>
<p>The goblin feels pretty defeatist at this point, though he wishes he had a ride out.</p>
<p>We leave the cells...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;Dear me, not a word of apology?&quot;</p>
<p>Theres a woman dressed up like a witch, in the colors of Grrcb (ciphered name here to prevent spoilers from another game): pink, purple, and black. She got tossed into Titania too, huh?</p>
<p>Seres asks her who she is: she calls herself a &quot;wise sorceress who travels the eleven seas, who scoffs at the might of dragons...&quot;</p>
<p>Her name is very long, but she calls herself <strong>Magilou.</strong></p>
<p>Velvet has no time for this.</p>
<p>Magilou, pronounced like &quot;soggy stew...&quot;</p>
<p>Seres tells Velvet to be cautious in the prison, and to trust nobody. Magilou has no malakhim, she&#39;s only an &quot;ordinary magician&quot; to Velvet.</p>
<p>We check the other cells.</p>
<p>One werewolf mentioned a friend who got dragged down below, to meet with Velvet&#39;s hand, I think. Velvet says she doesn&#39;t remember that moment.</p>
<p>Across the cell from the werewolf, we get a <strong>Life Bottle</strong> from a chest, our first one!</p>
<p>Theres a zombie and a werewolf in a hall, the zombie wants to attack the guards, but the zombie&#39;s slow...and the werewolf&#39;s like &quot;yeah, sure.&quot;</p>
<p>One prisoner is still trying to decide whether to stay or go too, and he really wants to see his daughter again...</p>
<p>South door, which is just barracks. I find <strong>Sage</strong> in a vase.</p>
<p>Now to head up...</p>
<p>We pick up a <strong>Void Ring!</strong></p>
<p>And there&#39;s another save point!</p>
<p>Climbing more stairs, we see an exorcist guard get KO&#39;d!</p>
<p><strong>Oh, there he is!!!</strong></p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Seres:</strong> &quot;This one, he&#39;s a daemon!&quot;</p>
<p>The swordsman pulls out his daggers! The fight begins!</p>
<p><strong>Swordsman:</strong> &quot;You&#39;re not human.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Neither are you.&quot;<br>
<strong>Swordsman:</strong> &quot;True enough.&quot;<br></p>
<p>Velvet points out that this guy&#39;s strong.</p>
<p>The swordsman wishes he had Stormhowl...</p>
<p>Wait a moment, so the sword that Velvet found earlier belongs to him...</p>
<p>He drops his daggers, runs to Velvet, and asks her where she found Stormhowl. Velvet tells him where it is. He thanks her and goes off to find it!</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;He&#39;s an odd daemon.&quot;</p>
<p>I like him.</p>
<p>We get <strong>Sharpshooter&#39;s Ventite</strong>, and some pointers on how to use the ventite: it uses charge abilities or something.</p>
<p>Seres somehow knows him, since he knows Stormhowl.</p>
<p><strong>Seres:</strong> &quot;The prisoners here are all so unusual.&quot; First there&#39;s Magilou, and now that swordsman, and she accidentally insults Velvet...</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We open the west door. Yikes!</p>
<p>We turn to the east, and climb more stairs...</p>
<p>The way to the docks is out, the hall there covered in piles of bodies...</p>
<p>We do battle with a duo of <strong>Orc</strong>s!</p>
<p>After saving again, we head up to the watchtower...</p>
<p>More guards come!</p>
<p>It looks like the prisoners are not going to make it...</p>
<p>We climb the ladders up to the roof...</p>
<p>It&#39;s raining.</p>
<p>Velvet looks at the long drop below...the pathway is gone.</p>
<p>But Velvet has other ideas. She pulls out her daemon arm. Seres is shocked to see the stunt Velvet&#39;s about to pull.</p>
<p>She jumps!</p>
<p>Oh my god! Velvet makes it, but a bit injured...</p>
<p>Seres realizes she&#39;s determined to have her revenge against Artorius. She vanishes and reappears by Velvet&#39;s side, healing her.</p>
<p>Seres explains an &quot;oath,&quot; where the oath taker binds to a malak, with certain conditions. Because of that, Velvet calls an oath a sort of curse.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Well, guess what? You&#39;re the ones that did this to me.&quot;</p>
<p>Seres is aware.</p>
<p>We pick up some <strong>Verbena</strong> and save...</p>
<p>Now we&#39;re heading to the front. Seres asks Velvet if she&#39;s sure that they&#39;re exiting through there. She is, since she thinks that the guards have already found Seres&#39;s ship at this point.</p>

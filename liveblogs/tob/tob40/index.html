<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> It seems that I missed the code red daemon in the sewers. Dangit!</p>
<p><strong><em>Another aside:</em></strong> Also, while browsing through tumblr to look for some Berseria stuff, namely a gif of Velvet doing her &quot;coo, coo&quot; dove trick, I might have accidentally caught a few glimpses of some spoilers. Hopefully, I forget those!</p>
<p><strong>Expedition check:</strong> I get a new recipe!</p>
<p>I look around town to see any ramifications after what happened last night in-game...</p>
<p>The maid&#39;s now talking to her idol, the musician!</p>
<p>A merchant knows our party from the dove trick we did at the entrance!</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Magilou&#39;s Menagerie. Get it right, or pay the price!&quot;</p>
<p>The merchant asks if we could perform in the port on the next day...oooh!</p>
<p>He also wants to see Velvet &quot;coo&quot; or act like a dove again. <strong>No. Way.</strong></p>
<p>The merchant gets insistent but Magilou steps in saying that her apprentice &quot;might show him a special trick she&#39;s been wanting to practice. One where she makes him &#39;disappear&#39;.&quot; Eeeeee....</p>
<p>He thinks it&#39;s fun, and wants to do it. Magilou turns serious, warning him he might not make it back...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>There&#39;s more guards up and about...</p>
<p>Another citizen mentions Gideon got injured, with the church putting up a really good cover story. Other rumors are spreading the real story...that people came in and attacked him...her daughter&#39;s still in awe of him. Velvet calls it &quot;a terrible rumor.&quot; Her son vows that if any &quot;bad guys&quot; come he&#39;ll defend his family.</p>
<p>Magilou, Velvet, and Rokurou huddle, knowing that the church&#39;s covered up the truth.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a girl&#39;s walk with her new dog didn&#39;t go so smoothly. Her father assures her that if she practices, the dog can be trained. She&#39;s determined to have that happen.</p>
<p>Nobles are talking about what happened last night in game. Abbey&#39;s covered it up real well with &quot;just thieves.&quot;</p>
<p>The clergy&#39;s now trying to cover it up with silence, with the Abbey ordering an inside investigation, just to keep Gideon&#39;s reputation intact.</p>
<p>And I learn Magilou can understand and communicate with dogs. &quot;Witchery 101,&quot; she says. Laphicet asks for a translation from the white dog we talked to.</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;Sorry boy, it&#39;s a dog-eat-dog world out there.&quot;</p>
<p>I talk to the white dog again. Magilou translates that he&#39;s teaching a math problem.</p>
<p>We head to the square to talk to more dogs. Magilou seems to understand them. This dog&#39;s complaining that they never get any sleep. A lot of people pet them.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;As you can see, she has a lot of criticism for the systematic injustices practiced by a hypocritical and tyrannical human society.&quot; That dog is really relatable.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;That is one astute doggy.&quot;</p>
<p>The dog goes on to empower himself with motivational mantras...</p>
<p>I have Magilou be leader. Her response: &quot;Why certainly!&quot;</p>
<p>Off to the cathedral!</p>
<p>We can head into the sewers, thank goodness, but we can&#39;t get into the villa. Meaning, we can fight the code red daemon below, yes!</p>
<p>A girl wants to see the ocean but she&#39;s told no because daemons are on the highway. The girl reminds Velvet of her brother...</p>
<p>Now a few nobles are onto the cat-loving priest after seeing droppings in the garden...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Inside the cathedral, a girl&#39;s confessing...</p>
<p>A priest mentions that the High Priest Gideon won&#39;t be holding services because he&#39;s ill...lies...</p>
<p>We go to <strong>that</strong> priest again with Magilou in tow...</p>
<p>She&#39;s now told to confess...</p>
<p>...and she starts using her charms on the priest! Lol! She says that she heard her &quot;charms&quot; in a romance novel! She asks for forgiveness for &quot;not putting herself to better use.&quot; </p>
<p>The priest knows she&#39;s lying...</p>
<p>Magilou digs deeper.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Oh no! I meant to confess my sins, but instead my confession was another sin!&quot; Lol, she is so bad...</p>
<p>The priest refuses to forgive her. Well, at least she spotted the flaws of the Empyrean Church very quickly.</p>
<p>The soldiers explain that they&#39;re beefing up security because of what happened at the palace.</p>
<p>One shrewd merchant in town&#39;s moved by <strong>that man</strong>&#39;s speech. The Shepherd&#39;s speech is inspiring him to make more profit. He plans to sell chalices near the Throne! It&#39;s not going to end well for him...</p>
<p>A dog&#39;s whining. Magilou translates that the dog&#39;s not happy with humans &quot;consorting&quot; with cats...the dog feels betrayed. Poor dog...</p>
<p>A soldier and townsperson are vowing to help the Shepherd at all costs...</p>
<p>A boy wonders if dogs can catch daemonblight. From what I&#39;ve seen, they might.</p>
<p>One sailor&#39;s bummed out that he can&#39;t get Nectar anymore. Eizen tells him it&#39;s got vermillion ore, and he curses at him too. The sailor now vows to get back to work. He&#39;s still experiencing withdrawal symptoms, though...</p>
<p>A Bloodwing disguised as a soldier wishes us safe travels.</p>
<p>With that, we&#39;re off!</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>On the bridge, Laphicet&#39;s a bit unsettled. Rokurou notices.</p>
<p>Laphicet points out the structure of the party. Rokurou: &quot;daemon swordsman&quot;, Eizen: &quot;cursed malak&quot;, Magilou: &quot;bizarre witch.&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet feels like he&#39;s out of place in the world.</p>
<p>Magilou steps in again, calling him &quot;Velvet&#39;s tool and emergency rations.&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet points out Teresa called him that too. <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Rokurou tells Laphicet that only he can decide what his place in the world is.</p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s still trying to get used to the idea of being free...</p>
<p>He thanks Eizen and Rokurou for their advice. </p>
<p>Magilou warns Laphicet to be careful where he&#39;s getting advice from.</p>
<p>Expedition check: we get a <strong>Fantastic Landscape painting!</strong></p>
<p>Eizen&#39;s impressed by the art!</p>
<p>Rokurou asks why there&#39;s a castle in the sky in the painting. Eizen goes into art appreciation mode, mentioning the &quot;Belformanism&quot; movement.</p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s still troubled by how that castle in the sky can operate and &quot;wonders what the heck&#39;s going on in that painting.&quot; Eizen tells him it&#39;s that way because the artist painted it that way. The dialogue&#39;s a bit funny...but the scenery is very nice...</p>
<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> Their dialogue with the painting reminded me of <a href=https://didyouknowfacts.com/facts/when-asked-about-the-many-people-who-question-the/ >Freddie Mercury&#39;s answer to people asking him about the meaning of &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;</a>.</p>
<p>Back at the port!</p>
<p>After tons of business with the weapon shop, we go to the inn, where news of Hellawes and Vortigern had spread to the Hellawes local there.</p>
<p>Outside, the port boy&#39;s amazed at the <em>Van Elt</em>—<em>Van Valvali</em>...</p>
<p>I do some more Katz minigames and talk to more people...</p>
<p>One&#39;s mentioned the warehouse fire, and thanks Eleanor for directing attention to put it out.</p>
<p>Now we talk to one of the pirates. The pirates are still scouting the northern road and temple. We decide to rest up for a bit.</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>It&#39;s the sunset before facing <strong>that man</strong>. It feels like the final battle&#39;s approaching...</p>
<p>I now have control of Velvet.</p>
<p>Scouts are taking longer than usual. Security must be really tight.</p>
<p>Rokurou and Dyle are talking about drinks, Illiagne Red...Rokurou thinks Rucarella cheese would compliment Illiagne Red. Oh my god, Rokurou...</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s line takes the cake: &quot;Wow, talk about oblivious.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou now asks Dyle if he could test his blade on his tail...Dyle&#39;s not having that...</p>
<p>Temple&#39;s built, but not open yet.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a mother who tries to fry squid, but it explodes in her face...</p>
<p>Benwick and Eizen talk about their next move. They sail the moment their scouts come back, not leaving anything to chance.</p>
<p>Eizen expects that the scouts haven&#39;t come back, and thinks of a plan B.</p>
<p>In the inn, more talk about Vortigern and Hellawes, assuming Aifread&#39;s crew did it.</p>
<p>A guy who&#39;s sort of familiar to me is sitting at the bar.</p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;Well, my belly is full, so I guess it&#39;s time to get started.&quot; For what?</p>
<p>There&#39;s a merchant whose business is ruined because of what happened at Hellawes...poor him.</p>
<p>Outside, Benwick tells us to “take good care of [Eizen],” mentioning his explosive personality.</p>
<p>Magilou&#39;s sitting under the shade, talking to Bienfu, mentioning an apple. Velvet hears that...Magilou sees her and tells Velvet to crow like a rooster if she wants it. But Velvet cuts her off.</p>
<p>Bienfu asks Magilou if she&#39;s going to fight <strong>that man</strong> as well, doubting the chances.</p>
<p>Magilou always treats Bienfu like her plaything. Poor Bienfu...</p>
<p>From overhearing a talk, I learn that the world the game takes place in is called <strong>Desolation.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Expedition check:</strong> we get a Chunky Potato Salad recipe!</p>
<p><a name=6></a></p>
<hr>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/kpAgJW3.png alt="laphicet apple" width=480 height=270 id=hd-liveblog></p>
<p>We talk to Laphicet, who has apples from Magilou. She asks him if it tastes good. He can taste it. He offers her one. She can&#39;t taste it...</p>
<p>Laphicet confesses that he&#39;s afraid of the sea, but he&#39;s awed and excited by it too. She mentions her brother and his love of the sea too.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Your way of looking at the world is so much like his...I wish I wish I&#39;d bought him that compass. I wish we could&#39;ve traveled together. Like he wanted.&quot; <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>I&#39;m betting she&#39;s letting herself down again for not being a better sister...</p>
<p>And the scouts have returned!</p>
<p>Velvet tells Laphicet he doesn&#39;t have to go along with her for her revenge...</p>
<p>Laphicet decides to go with her.</p>
<p>Everyone&#39;s huddled by the front gate.</p>
<p>Eizen and Benwick mention a man with a pendulum, and that he took care of the guards in a jiffy! Eizen runs off.</p>
<p>Rokurou reports that exorcists have been attacked by a malak wielding a pendulum. (Wait a minute, is the guy sitting at the bar that I just saw earlier that same person?)</p>
<p>Velvet asks if he also took Aifread too. Magilou sings that &quot;their key,&quot; the malak, is running away.</p>
<p>Velvet decides to pursue him.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Pandemonium! My favorite! Eizen sure picked an inconvenient time to run off though, didn&#39;t he?!&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Can&#39;t blame him. He&#39;s got his own purpose.&quot;</p>
<p>Benwick explains the situation about the malak, even the scouts are in shock and warn us to be careful!</p>
<p>We exit to the northern gate. It&#39;s nightfall now.</p>
<p>I do more weapon customization at the nearby Turtlez weapon shop, and save.</p>
<p>Magilou and Velvet&#39;s victory exchanges are a bit funny...</p>
<p>I do some more level grinding, also building up Laphicet&#39;s cooking skills...</p>
<p>There&#39;s Eizen and that guy at the port bar!</p>
<p><a name=7></a></p>
<hr>
<p>So that&#39;s the guy with the pendulum Eizen and the crew were looking for!</p>
<p>The pendulum guy compliments Eizen&#39;s moves!</p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;A buddy of Aifread&#39;s? Oh, this&#39;ll be too good.&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen assumes this is the guy that took his captain.</p>
<p>Velvet and crew now propose to team up with him. He doesn&#39;t buy it.</p>
<p>Eizen and the pendulum guy tell her to stay out. Velvet decides to fight them both! Everyone else is in shock!</p>
<p>Looks like we&#39;re fighting both of them!</p>
<p>Why is it that whenever one of our allies is the enemy they&#39;re more stronger than usual?</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Why does it have to be like this?&quot; I feel you. Magilou tells Rokurou to be quiet and help Velvet.</p>
<p>I have Rokurou target the other malak.</p>
<p>Mygoodnesstheseguysaretough!</p>
<p>We finally beat them both.</p>
<p>Now the other guy asks what we&#39;ll do after we punch through the barrier. He knocks on the barrier as if it were a door...</p>
<p>Velvet plainly tells him her task.</p>
<p>The pendulum guy winks and asks us what we want from him.</p>
<p>Bienfu is summoned. Bienfu, Eizen, Laphicet, and the pendulum guy stand before the barrier...</p>
<p>Laphicet touches the barrier and shatters it!</p>
<p>The pendulum-wielding malak walks away, expecting to see a good show. Seems like he&#39;s no friend of the Abbey. Eizen tries to ask him more questions. Nope.</p>
<p><a name=8></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;If you persist, one of us will end up dead.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Who are you? Tell me.&quot;</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/G57tipQ.png alt="zaveid the whirlwind" width=480 height=270 id=hd-liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Zaveid:</strong> &quot;<strong>Zaveid the Whirlwind. A fighter, nothing more.</strong>&quot; I knew it! That guy did look familiar!</p>
<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> (ciphered for spoilers) V unir abg cynlrq <em>Mrfgvevn</em>, ohg V qb xabj n ybg bs fcbvyref nobhg gung tnzr. Mnirvq vf va gung tnzr.</p>
<p>He smiles, shrugs, and walks away.</p>
<p>Velvet tells Eizen that she&#39;s not stopping him from leaving the party. He&#39;s staying because he wants more info from Melchior.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Could&#39;ve saved you a lot of trouble if you&#39;d listened to me from the start.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;If I had good judgment, I wouldn&#39;t be where I am in the first place.&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen is a stubborn one...</p>
<p>Just like how Eizen called Velvet a &quot;fool&quot; back at the bar in Loegres, Velvet calls him a &quot;fool.&quot;</p>
<p>We get a <strong>Smoldering Glacite</strong> and an <strong>Armory Acerite 1!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Skit:</strong> Laphicet apologizes to Eizen for fighting him. He jokes that he hates him &quot;till he reaches his grave&quot; though. Oh my god, Eizen.</p>
<p>He gives Laphicet more advice.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;And if your choice leads to killing me, I won&#39;t complain.&quot; <img class=emojione alt=😢 title=:cry: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/1f622.png></p>
<p>He also mentions that their choices would lead to him killing us off... <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Eizen&#39;s getting &quot;riled up&quot; about Zaveid...looks like Batman pirate&#39;s met his Joker...</p>
<p>We examine the guards.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;They&#39;re all alive, but unconscious.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;A fighter, not a killer, huh?&quot;</p>
<p>Wandering around the highway, it turns out the way to the south leads to the road before Galles...</p>
<p>After a bit more exploring and battles, I save before the way to the Empyrean&#39;s Throne...</p>

<p></p><h2 class=entry-title>Tales of Berseria - Part 40a: Code Red Daemon In the Sewers</h2><p></p>

<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> I did this hunt before heading into the port.</p>
<p>But I turn back and head into the sewers to face off against the code red daemon!</p>
<p>It&#39;s the <strong>Pillbug</strong>, and he makes a really unsettling noise...</p>
<p>This guy&#39;s a really tough one, though weak to wind and hidden artes...</p>
<p>I switch to Velvet, and span wind artes and Shell Splitter on the daemon...</p>
<p>We eventually beat him and win an <strong>Elemental Dispersing Glacite!</strong></p>
<p>I get more pointers on status ailments and switching party members...</p>
<p>After saving, we go back to the city and get our ree-ward!</p>
<p>We sell more materials, and I realize just now that we have a <strong>Rough Gemstone</strong> worth 21,700!!</p>

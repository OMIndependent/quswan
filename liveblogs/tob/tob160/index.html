<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>We head inside the Earthpulse, the first layer&#39;s already on the area map...</p>
<p>We fight the code red daemon here, the Phantom, before proceeding...</p>
<p>As we approach the end of the first layer, we get more backstory!</p>
<p>The Shepherd has formed an oath with Seres, with Melchior overlooking the proceedings...</p>
<p><strong>Melchior:</strong> &quot;Seres, take heed. I&#39;ve now embedded a portion of the arte formula within your corporeal form. Over the next several months, it should take hold and crystallize using the power of the oath.&quot;</p>
<p>Melchior&#39;s being really deceiving as usual...</p>
<p>So Melchior himself put the Sorcerer&#39;s Ring into Seres!? Oh my god!</p>
<p><strong>Melchior:</strong> &quot;It is an arte that was lost long [...] ago on this continent. Reviving it requires considerable investment.&quot;<br>
<strong>Seres:</strong> &quot;So that is why you tied the oath to my life force. The formula will only be completed once I&#39;ve...died [...] I understand that this is a necessary step in order to realize [fusion] and bring Innominat under your control.&quot;</p>
<p>So the Shepherd was planning to fuse with Innominat even in-between the three years Velvet was in prison.</p>
<p>Seres mentions Siegfried...so Melchior&#39;s trying to find the gun at this time...</p>
<p>Seres wants to fast-track the R&amp;D.</p>
<p><strong>Melchior:</strong> (to Seres) &quot;From here on, you are to focus on completing the Sorcerer&#39;s Ring.&quot;</p>
<p>Melchior asks the Shepherd if he&#39;s changed his mind at all...nope.</p>
<p>Seres calls herself &quot;a tool...to fulfill [the Shepherd]&#39;s ideals.&quot; <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;So Seres took an oath to make [fusion] possible.&quot;<br>
<strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;But what a heavy price to make her pay...&quot; I know.<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> (disgusted) &quot;And [the Shepherd] did it knowing that she was his reincarnated wife.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor stops herself, and realizes that if she hadn&#39;t followed Velvet, she would&#39;ve ended up doing &quot;the same thing.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;What happened to Seres, and to Aifread, and Siegfried... it&#39;s all related. This all occurred so [the Shepherd] could [fuse] with Innominat...&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;And Velvet devoured that power and making herself enemy number one...how deliciously ironic!&quot;</p>
<p>But in her case, it&#39;s therionization, not armatization...</p>
<p>But Velvet points out Seres knew about this. She&#39;s clever.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;But the Abbey has secured Siegfried&#39;s formula, and they&#39;re [...] using it to complete Innominat&#39;s [fusion].&quot;</p>
<p>We press onwards!</p>

<p>Another flashback: to Arthur and Celica.</p>
<p><strong>Arthur:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s been a full century since Midgand reunited the fractured land. In that time, we&#39;ve enjoyed a blissful era of peace and prosperity. But the world has also seen its faith and moral purity slowly decay [...] Things have gotten so bad that nobody has even realized that the four Empyreans now slumber. I&#39;m entirely certain that daemons will only become ever more [powerful]...And yet I&#39;m powerless to stop it!&quot;</p>
<p>Celica has no idea what he&#39;s saying.</p>
<p>Arthur comes to, and apologizes.</p>
<p><strong>Celica:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s fine, really! You&#39;ve seen so much of the world. Things that I never even knew existed.&quot;<br>
<strong>Arthur:</strong> &quot;Yes... I&#39;ve seen mountains spew flame, and lands covered in ice. I&#39;ve crossed stormy seas and ravines deeper than the eye can see.&quot; He&#39;s probably seen the Tannhauser gate too...</p>
<p>Celica&#39;s in awe of his travels. She asks if he was scared.</p>
<p><strong>Arthur:</strong> &quot;Of course! We are nothing in the face of nature. It takes so little for a person to lose their life out in the wilds. But in spite of the terror, [...] they&#39;re absolutely breathtaking. And even in the harshest of climes, people still find a way to live there and carve out something resembling a home.&quot;<br>
<strong>Celica:</strong> &quot;I think I understand you now [...] I can tell you really love this world. Not just that, but all the people who live in it too.&quot;<br>
<strong>Arthur:</strong> &quot;The world...and its people...Do you really think so?&quot;<br>
<strong>Celica:</strong> &quot;I&#39;m sure of it. Just...remember that you&#39;re one of those people too, you know? You really should try to take care of yourself a little more.&quot;</p>
<p>Arthur&#39;s still doubtful of his own power...he&#39;s got really low self-esteem deep down...</p>
<p><strong>Celica:</strong> &quot;I believe in you, Arthur. I mean, my family and I are already quite fond of you just the way you are, no matter your faults.&quot; The irony in that line is so deep.</p>
<p><strong>Arthur:</strong> &quot;Thank you, Celica...&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s how I remember Celica...and him too...&quot;</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s now the one who&#39;s getting angrier...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Eleanor, I know that the exorcists believe from the bottom of their hearts that their work will save everyone.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;...But that won&#39;t stop you from fighting them, will it?&quot;</p>
<p>Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Isn&#39;t ignorance bliss? Should we really keep digging up the past like this?&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Velvet&#39;s never been the one to pick the easy road.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;I was just thinking...the Earthen Historia is supposed to be a vast record of world history [...] why does it only ever focus on events related to Velvet&#39;s life?&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor thinks it might be responding to Velvet, or it&#39;s because Innominat used to run the earthpulse as his vessel, in a way. It still has traces of his influence.</p>
<p>Magilou brings up another good point to Laphicet.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Shouldn&#39;t you be able to control the Earthen Historia...? You&#39;re supposed to be part of Innominat.&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou&#39;s getting excited at the backstory we could find here...</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;I&#39;m not so sure. Having that much access might be frightening. Some things aren&#39;t so fun to learn about.&quot; Laphicet does have a point. History was mostly about the ugly stuff.</p>
<p>The last of the Earthen Historia here...</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>...with Laphicet and Seres...</p>
<p><strong>Seres:</strong> &quot;I hear that you&#39;ve finally gotten your assignment. Have they given you a name yet?&quot;<br>
<strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;Malak Number Two.&quot; <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p><strong>Seres:</strong> &quot;That isn&#39;t your name.&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet looks puzzled.</p>
<p><strong>Seres:</strong> &quot;You don&#39;t remember anything, do you? But of course you don&#39;t. You died before you were even born.&quot;</p>
<p>Seres pulls out a comb. Oh my god!</p>
<p>This was probably in between the three years that Velvet was imprisoned on Titania...</p>
<p><strong>Seres:</strong> &quot;But my memories...<strong>they came back.</strong>&quot; Oh my god!</p>
<p><strong>Seres:</strong> &quot;And these memories...<strong>they torment me. I can never replace them...and I can&#39;t undo them...</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet doesn&#39;t understand.</p>
<p><strong>Seres:</strong> &quot;You don&#39;t have to. Just know that I was happier before my memories and free will reawakened.&quot; How did that happen? It&#39;s probably Celica&#39;s ghost rising to the surface.</p>
<p>Seres wishes &quot;that [Laphicet] would stay the way [he is.]&quot; She walks away, almost about to cry...no, she isn&#39;t!</p>
<p><strong>Seres:</strong> &quot;<strong>I&#39;m going to free someone who can kill the strongest Empyrean and the head exorcist.</strong>&quot; She&#39;s going to free Velvet!</p>
<p><strong>Seres:</strong> &quot;<strong>I suppose you could call it revenge...against myself, and against my past.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>She turns to Laphicet.</p>
<p><strong>Seres:</strong> &quot;Goodbye. Please...<strong>find it in your heart to forgive your mother when she failed to protect you...</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Now the crew&#39;s warped back to Velvet&#39;s cell in Titania! Magilou&#39;s surprised by the sudden teleportation!</p>
<p>Eizen thinks they came back to Velvet&#39;s cell via Earthpulse Warp.</p>
<p>Laphicet doesn&#39;t remember Seres... <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;I guess I must have met Seres at some point, but...I don&#39;t have any memory of it happening...&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou wonders why that earthpulse would lead to Titania...</p>
<p>We just probably jumped from one earthpulse point to another. All because Seres wanted to tell us something...</p>
<p>Eleanor confirms that.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;I think the Earthen Historia showed us that memory because Seres wanted us to see it. Or Velvet and Laphicet at least.&quot;</p>
<p>So her spirit is still driving the entire crew, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;I think I understand. And I...I think I agree.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou has no complaints now, because at least we now know more backstory.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> (smiling) &quot;This was worthwhile.&quot;</p>
<p>As the crew&#39;s ship begins to dock at Titania, Laphicet looks back.</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;I...can think and decide for myself now, but...it&#39;s kind of nice. I feel alive like this. <strong>So rest easy, mom...I&#39;ll be okay.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>We get a <strong>different color version</strong> of Velvet&#39;s in-game outfit!</p>
<p>Now we can use the Earthpulse to jump from Velvet&#39;s cell to Innominat&#39;s shrine in Tranquil Woods!</p>

<p>After an out of town trip and tons of offline stuff, I&#39;m back and ready to finish this game!</p>
<p>I check the guide and find there&#39;s cutscenes inside the prison I haven&#39;t gotten to yet. I rest up at the prison twice to see them.</p>
<p>Dyle and Benwick are arguing again...</p>
<p>Benwick calls Dyle an &quot;old man&quot;, and it&#39;s almost to blows here...</p>
<p>Velvet does her &quot;I&#39;ll eat you&quot; threat again to stop them!</p>
<p>Eleanor points out the inconsistency of the bickering of the pirates who are &quot;friends,&quot; while mentioning they would rescue sailors allied with the Abbey even though they&#39;re sworn enemies...</p>
<p>Benwick doesn&#39;t get it.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;You&#39;re treating your ally like your enemy and your enemy like your ally.&quot;</p>
<p>Benwick tells her &quot;she has a lot to learn.&quot;</p>
<p>Dyle adds on to the Abbey&#39;s flaws.</p>
<p><strong>Dyle:</strong> &quot;You talk all about going around helping people, but you don&#39;t know the first thing about sailing.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Are you implying that the first thing about sailing is to help your enemies?&quot;</p>
<p>Dyle gives the mic to Benwick. Benwick sees people stranded at sea as people stranded at sea, not allies, not enemies. He tells her about &quot;how vast and deep the ocean is.&quot; And also how dangerous and merciless too without a ship...</p>
<p><strong>Benwick:</strong> &quot;Out on the sea, even a single board of driftwood can mean the difference between staying afloat and [sinking] to the depths...&quot;</p>
<p>They take any prisoners, because of the ocean&#39;s mercilessness. Dyle&#39;s aware of the hypocrisy of saving Abbey people too.</p>
<p>Eleanor calls them &quot;an interesting bunch.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Benwick:</strong> &quot;Plus, if the people we rescue end up getting another ship, we can attack them again and take all their new loot.&quot; Oh my god...</p>
<p>Dyle compares it to hunting every last prickleboar in the wood. Velvet seems to know that analogy.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;...and my faith is gone.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet asks about the bickering.</p>
<p>Dyle&#39;s angry that Benwick put lemon juice on his fried chicken! Too much lemon juice! Benwick, that only works on fried fish, not chicken!</p>
<p>Velvet thinks of splashing water on them...</p>
<p>Eleanor suggests the water be cold.</p>
<p>These two, they do think alike...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The next <strong>skit</strong>...</p>
<p>Kamoana tells Dyle that Medissa&#39;s planning octopus daemon for dinner and wants to catch some!</p>
<p>Eleanor brings up Dyle and Kamoana&#39;s friendship...</p>
<p>Dyle&#39;s sweating...</p>
<p>Laphicet points out Kamoana mentioning his warm heart beneath his cold-blooded lizardness...</p>
<p>Dyle mentions his tail. Has it grown back? It&#39;s going to...</p>
<p><strong>Kamoana:</strong> &quot;<strong>Boo!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Dyle jumps!</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;Oh no, his tail!&quot;</p>
<p>Lol...V erzrzore Lhev chyyrq n fyvtugyl fvzvyne fpner gevpx ba Xneby va <em>Irfcrevn</em>.</p>
<p>Kamoana mentions Dyle being &quot;soooooo slow.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Kamoana:</strong> (looks down) &quot;But...I&#39;m sorry...&quot;</p>
<p>Dyle tells her not to worry and mentions that &quot;lizard tails&quot; are good bait to lure octopus daemons with.</p>
<p>Dyle and Kamoana go off to hunt some dinner...</p>
<p>Now we head off to the Aldina Plains...</p>
<p>It&#39;s raining...the dragon must be at the mountain peak...</p>
<p>After reading a tumblr post, I realize I can cook multiple times, not once before a battle.</p>
<p>I do several warmup battles on the way to the mountain, almost close to building up Velvet&#39;s cooking level to 10...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The dragon&#39;s up at the summit, her oozing malevolence behind her wings...</p>
<p>Zaveid&#39;s also before her too...as she hits him!</p>
<p>And he&#39;s talking to her, mentioning the good old days...the dragon whips her tail at him!</p>
<p>This is not good!</p>
<p>Zaveid&#39;s flung off!</p>
<p>Laphicet tries to save him, but Eizen holds him back, telling him to watch!</p>
<p>But Zaveid notices the party!</p>
<p><strong>Zaveid:</strong> &quot;So you&#39;re just waiting for me to die so you can help yourself to her heart, is that it?&quot;</p>
<p>He&#39;s not going to go down, and he will not let the crew take the dragon&#39;s life...</p>
<p>Eizen, in his pro-free will bluster, says that only he gets to &quot;decide what to do.&quot;</p>
<p>Zaveid prepares to power himself up with Siegfried but the dragon breathes a fireball!</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;Then I&#39;m deciding to help Zaveid no matter what you tell me, Eizen!&quot; Oh, Laphicet...</p>
<p>But Zaveid&#39;s down and the dragon flies away!</p>
<p>Eizen goes to him...</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;This dragon won&#39;t hesitate to attack a child, or the man who risks his own life to protect it.&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen asks him who the dragon is...</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;You said that your creed was to never give up on living, no matter what may happen. If you really believe that...would you say that you&#39;re living right now? Because to me, you don&#39;t look like someone truly living.&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet realizes Eizen&#39;s planning a mercy kill on Theodora...</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;<strong>It&#39;s time to lift this curse.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Zaveid&#39;s theme is still strumming, as we face the dragon again...</p>
<p>Laphicet joins in!</p>
<p>Eizen warns him about the dragon&#39;s malevolence, Laphicet returns the warning!</p>
<p>I start attacking the dragon directly at the front, but that&#39;s a bad idea!</p>
<p>From the guide, I decide to approach her from the sides and back...</p>
<p>She&#39;s a bit tough, but after fighting Phoenix, everything feels a bit easier...</p>
<p>I finish her off with Rokurou&#39;s Mystic Arte!</p>
<p>Eizen moves forward to carry out the deed.</p>
<p><strong>Zaveid:</strong> &quot;If you kill her...I&#39;ll never forgive you, Eizen!&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;<strong>I know.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>He punches the dragon out!</p>
<p>Eizen catches the dragon&#39;s malevolence...oh god...</p>
<p>So does Zaveid!</p>
<p>Laphicet goes on ahead, but catches it too!</p>
<p>Then his silver flame purifies him and the two malakhim!</p>
<p>Rokurou points out Laphicet&#39;s power once more.</p>
<p>That was close...</p>
<p>Magilou looks serious, though fascinated...</p>
<p>Laphicet uses the silver flame, and she awakens! </p>
<p>As he goes to her, Zaveid stops him!</p>
<p>Zaveid&#39;s resigned to Theodora&#39;s fate...</p>
<p>He takes a knee, exhausted from her malevolence...</p>
<p><strong>Zaveid:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s over...<strong>thank you.</strong>&quot; No...</p>
<p>Eizen now uses Siegfried on himself and the rock part of Zaveid&#39;s theme plays...</p>
<p>Eizen punches the dragon once more, and absorbs her! Or has he vanquished her?</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Zaveid:</strong> &quot;Why didn&#39;t you break your Reaper&#39;s Curse?&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;What, did you want me to eat its heart?&quot;<br>
<strong>Zaveid:</strong> &quot;Don&#39;t answer a question with another question.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;The Reaper&#39;s Curse is mine to bear alone. <strong>The danger of becoming a dragon, however, is a curse upon all malakhim.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Zaveid warns him about malevolence again...</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;I can already feel it starting. It won&#39;t be long before I wind up like her.&quot;<br>
<strong>Zaveid:</strong> &quot;You&#39;ll have to leave your pirate buddies before things turn ugly.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;I&#39;m the first mate...so to be honest...it&#39;s probably just as well...I&#39;d rather end up a dragon than have this curse hijack my ship and my life any more.&quot; Looks like Eizen knows how he&#39;s going to end up...</p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s not happy...</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;But I do fear one thing...I&#39;m afraid that when I turn into a dragon, I could end up hurting the [...] people I want to protect.&quot;</p>
<p>Zaveid&#39;s aware that Theodora&#39;s not herself anymore, and tells him that &quot;he saved her.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Zaveid:</strong> &quot;Theodora was a kind woman...she never wanted to hurt people, and she loved more deeply than anyone I&#39;ve ever known.&quot;</p>
<p>And they bring up mercy killing again...</p>
<p>Zaveid mentions Eizen&#39;s protectorates, namely his sister...</p>
<p><strong>Eizen</strong> describes her: &quot;She&#39;s like an early blooming flower. Wise for her age. She&#39;s got it all together...she cries easily, too...but...she&#39;s so strong.&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen smiles.</p>
<p>Zaveid thinks of marrying her. I... don&#39;t think she&#39;d want you, Zaveid...</p>
<p>Zaveid &quot;promises not to do anything&quot; until he&#39;s taken care of Eizen.</p>
<p><strong>Zaveid:</strong> &quot;Consider it revenge for Theodora. I&#39;ll be the one who finally puts you out of your misery.&quot; He smiles one of his winning smiles.</p>
<p><strong>Zaveid:</strong> &quot;<strong>But I&#39;ll only kill you once you&#39;ve stopped being yourself...Only then.</strong>&quot; Naq your riraghnyyl qbrf...</p>
<p>Zaveid swears it, using his true name: <strong>Fylk Zahdeya</strong>, or Zaveid the Oathkeeper...</p>
<p>Eizen mentions his true name too: <strong>Ufemew Wexub</strong>.</p>
<p>He hands back Siegfried to Zaveid.</p>
<p>Laphicet looks down. Poor him.</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;Is there really no other way?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;In the end, what matters isn&#39;t whether we get killed or not. It&#39;s whether we can take control over [...] our own lives.&quot;<br>
<strong>Zaveid:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s what it means to really be alive.&quot;<br>
<strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;That sounds sad...and hard...But...I understand. And I&#39;m going to live life in my own way too!&quot;</p>
<p>Zaveid walks off...</p>
<p><strong>Zaveid:</strong> &quot;...<strong>Wherever the wind takes me.</strong>&quot;</p>

<hr>
<p>I boost Velvet&#39;s cooking level to 10, and I&#39;m rewarded with another skit: <strong>What Celica Taught Her.</strong></p>
<p>Laphicet compliments Velvet&#39;s cooking.</p>
<p>Velvet mentions that she did the cooking after Celica passed on...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;The most important thing is adding just the right amount of salt, and the final adjustments of flavor...and you have to make a wish that it turns out tasty.&quot;</p>
<p>Just like how Celica taught her...</p>
<p>Laphicet, amazed, points out Celica&#39;s &quot;masterchef&quot; skill. Velvet believes that &quot;she&#39;ll never be her match.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;I&#39;ve lost my taste...but I&#39;ve also forgotten what it even feels like to taste something delicious. What I make isn&#39;t really food...it&#39;s merely sustenance...&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true, Velvet.&quot; He eats Velvet&#39;s cooking, and calls it the best!</p>
<p>Velvet mentions another thing Celica said...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;She always wished for our food to taste good because she wanted to see us happy when we ate it.&quot; Isn&#39;t the whole idea of good food to make people happy?</p>
<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> I think that&#39;s also the reason why I&#39;m also a bit of a food and cooking buff too. I probably make food, mostly baking, to make other people, mostly myself, happy, since I&#39;m a bit of a food lover. But I&#39;m only interested in cooking as a hobby, so I can still enjoy it...</p>
<p>Velvet also points out that Celica said that &quot;she ate like a pig.&quot; That&#39;s probably how good Celica&#39;s food is!</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> (to Laphicet) &quot;It&#39;s a good thing [to eat like a pig]. You should eat a lot too, so you can grow up big and strong.&quot;</p>
<p>And I&#39;m rewarded with a <strong>Jacketless Outfit</strong> for Velvet!</p>

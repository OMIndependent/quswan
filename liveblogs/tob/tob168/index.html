<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>In the daytime, the Empyrean&#39;s Throne looks more grander...</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;I can feel him...! Innominat&#39;s somewhere in the sky.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;In the sky? Wait, look...&quot;</p>
<p>The malakhim here are more different...a <strong>Two-Tailed Fox</strong>, <strong>Phantasmal Needle</strong>, <strong>Enticing Glamor</strong>, and the <strong>Wings of Misfortune</strong>...</p>
<p>I move the camera upwards, where a tiny circle up in the skies is...</p>
<p>That must be where Innominat and the Shepherd are.</p>
<p>The music sounds ominous...</p>
<p>Up to the western part of this area, as I climb the ladder...</p>
<p>It&#39;s been almost four months since the last time we were here last...now the legates are gone, and the Shepherd and Innominat are left.</p>
<p>In one of the entrances, two maskless malakhim are talking.</p>
<p>The earth and wind malakhim thank us for freeing them from Innominat&#39;s control.</p>
<p>Velvet says she was only doing it for herself. Oh, Velvet...</p>
<p>The malakhim say they&#39;re now frightened of getting exposed to malevolence.</p>
<p><strong>Malak:</strong> &quot;Before Innominat&#39;s interference we were a peaceful people.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet don&#39;t care. Eizen now speaks.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;We get what you&#39;re saying. But if we go easy on anybody, then we&#39;ll be the ones who get killed. If you truly want to protect your friends, you&#39;ll have to stop us by force.&quot; My god, Eizen...the crew doesn&#39;t do anything by halves.</p>
<p>Velvet now asks them now that they have free will, what are they going to do about them?</p>
<p><strong>Earth Malak:</strong> &quot;And that&#39;s why we too will work toward the future we desire.&quot;<br>
<strong>Wind Malak:</strong> &quot;In order to achieve a perfect fusion of human and malak power, the Abbey gave [fusions] a physical form [...] they&#39;re vessels [...] that can manipulate mana. They call these objects divine artifacts.&quot; Divine artifacts?</p>
<p>Laphicet asks if the bow the wind malak is holding is one of them. It is.</p>
<p><strong>Wind Malak:</strong> &quot;We decided we want to pass on the knowledge behind the divine artifacts and [fusion] to future generations.&quot; Oh my god!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Even Laphicet&#39;s not having that, and asks why.</p>
<p>They want humans and malakhim to get along.</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;<strong>What!?</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>The earth malak explains further that the fusion is a &quot;one-sided&quot;, or forced, process by the human.</p>
<p><strong>Wind Malak:</strong> &quot;But imagine if humans and malakhim could [fuse] with mutual awareness and consent.&quot; The Crystal Gems might be happy with that...</p>
<p>The earth malak agrees, out of necessity to defend themselves from forces such as &quot;the Lord of Calamity.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s, like, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s another potential for the future.&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet agrees.</p>
<p>The wind malak, though, says that we&#39;re too late: Innominat&#39;s divine artifact is &quot;complete.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Meaning [The Shepherd] himself will use the divine artifact to [fuse] with Innominat.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Earth Malak:</strong> &quot;For the good of the future, we&#39;ll pray for your success in battle...Lord of Calamity.&quot; Dang!</p>
<p>So the Lord of Calamity gave her blessing for the malakhim to continue fusion, and the malakhim, in turn, pray for her success at finishing her mission!</p>
<p>The earth malak, though, warns us that there are malakhim who still follow the Shepherd even after they&#39;ve been freed. The ones that see no hope for living with humans. After all they&#39;ve been put through by the exorcists...</p>
<p><strong>Earth Malak:</strong> &quot;But I don&#39;t believe the way to the future can be found through despair.&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet agrees.</p>
<p>The wind malak&#39;s thinking of tests to measure the will between malakhim and humans as a way to grant fusion.</p>

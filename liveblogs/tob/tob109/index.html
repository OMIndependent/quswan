<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>I continue clearing the Baird Marsh of its treasures.</p>
<p>After some geoboarding and switch activating, I make it to the second-to-last area here...</p>
<p>I grab a pair of <strong>Military Hike</strong> boots from the sunken part of the ruin in this area.</p>
<p>We make it to a large landmass, where, in the corner of ruined columns, we get <strong>Old Flyers</strong> for Phi!</p>
<p>We turn back and see that the way to the therion and Oscar is blocked by a set of blue and yellow barriers. I set the crystal switches and save here...</p>
<p>Another long trail and a den of monsters later, we find the earthpulse point!</p>
<p>Teresa asks everyone if they know the plan. Velvet reminds her that she&#39;s a hostage for Oscar, and to not to do &quot;anything funny.&quot;</p>
<p>I pick up a <strong>Summertime Waistcoat</strong>...</p>
<p>Ahead, we see a huge meadow of white flowers, with Oscar and the therion in the middle of them...</p>
<p>East of where Oscar is, I pick up a <strong>Valkyrie</strong> spear for Eleanor!</p>
<p>There&#39;s the therion lying on the flowerbed...with Oscar looking on.</p>
<p><strong>Oscar:</strong> &quot;I knew you&#39;d come, Velvet.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet now holds Teresa hostage.</p>
<p>Oscar calls her a &quot;coward.&quot; Eleanor apologizes, and tells him of her quest for the truth.</p>
<p>Teresa makes her apologies to Oscar. Oscar disarms slowly...and throws his sword at Velvet!</p>
<p>Teresa runs behind Oscar...</p>
<p>...and knocks him out!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Teresa:</strong> &quot;Forgive me Oscar... this is the only way I can protect you.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet tells Teresa to leave with Oscar.</p>
<p><strong>Teresa:</strong> &quot;<strong>I can&#39;t do that. It will reflect poorly upon him.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>She knows she&#39;s only human without her malak.</p>
<p><strong>Teresa:</strong> &quot;But he has shown me the light! And it shines! My body is receptive to Innominat&#39;s power!&quot;</p>
<p>She approaches the therion.</p>
<p><strong>Teresa:</strong> &quot;And with it, <strong>I can protect everything I care about!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>She lets the therion eat her!!!</p>
<p>No, fuse with her!</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;She turned into a therion?!&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou confirms what me and Phi said.</p>
<p>Now our fight with Teresa begins!</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Merging with a therion...do you realize what you&#39;re doing, Teresa?!&quot;</p>
<p>Now I&#39;m thinking of more <em>Steven Universe</em> puns to write down right now...</p>
<p><strong>Teresa:</strong> &quot;A trivial sacrifice! I&#39;d do anything for my Oscar!&quot;</p>
<p>Teresa also knows how to Jump like a dragoon...</p>
<p>Now she performs her Mystic Arte on Velvet: <strong>Violent Mix!</strong></p>
<p>A minute later, Phi tries to talk to her...</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;Teresa, stop this already! Please!&quot;<br>
<strong>Teresa:</strong> &quot;There&#39;s no turning back! Not with so much at stake! His future depends on this!&quot;</p>
<p>Her <strong>Explode</strong> arte is another danger we have to watch out for! It&#39;s taken out both Velvet and Rokurou!</p>
<p>Now Teresa goes after Phi with her Mystic Arte!</p>
<p>And it all goes downhill from here for us as she continues spamming her Explode spell...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Now for round two...</p>
<p>With tons of adjustments, we finish her off easily!</p>
<p>She falls, trampling the flowers beneath her...still not giving up...</p>
<p>Oscar comes to Teresa...</p>
<p><strong>Oscar:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s okay, sister...you&#39;ve done enough.&quot;<br>
<strong>Teresa:</strong> &quot;No, don&#39;t look at me...&quot;</p>
<p>Oscar tells his story to her.</p>
<p><strong>Oscar:</strong> &quot;When I was growing up, the only one my mother and father ever paid any attention to was my older brother the heir. But you, Teresa...you noticed when they didn&#39;t. You looked after me. Supported me...I could never thank you enough, my sister...&quot;</p>
<p>Oh my god...</p>
<p><strong>Oscar:</strong> &quot;Now keep watching over me, Teresa. As long as you&#39;re looking after me...<strong>I can vanquish even the lord of daemons!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Now it&#39;s his turn to fight...</p>
<p>His only malak joins him.</p>
<p><strong>Oscar:</strong> &quot;Take a good look...<strong>this is armatization!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Here we go, another fusion!</p>
<p>A set of glowing wings grow behind him! And he&#39;s glowing like an angel...</p>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/sd_IG2wH8DE>Here&#39;s Oscar&#39;s armatization theme!<br></a> <a href=https://youtu.be/qDwxoR54_oU>Along with Teresa&#39;s battle theme!</a></p>
<p>Oscar lunges, descending down like a vengeful angel!</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Wh-what&#39;s happened to him?!&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;He merged with his malak?!&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s one hell of an arte!&quot;</p>
<p>He tires out all of us by firing wind spikes from his wings!</p>
<p>After a few hits later, Oscar&#39;s straining from the fusion...and fires wind beams around one part of the arena!</p>
<p>He casts his Mystic Arte: <strong>Sylphid Blaze!</strong></p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s hanging on so far, and the battle continues!</p>
<p>It&#39;s a real long one, but not as hard as the previous battle with Teresa...</p>
<p>I finish him off with Eleanor, along with help from Velvet&#39;s therionization attacks!</p>

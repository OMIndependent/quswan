<p>I sell some materials and scraps (including more gems, which sell very high!) before going to play more waiting tables...</p>
<p>There&#39;s Tabatha talking with one of her employees...</p>
<p>Another round of waiting tables, and looks like Rokurou gets his serving outfit as well!</p>
<p>So does Eleanor! The menu&#39;s more longer too!</p>
<p>After a few rounds of waiting tables with Rokurou, I head to the inn to rest!</p>
<p><strong>Skit:</strong> Eleanor wants to go in their inn room. Velvet says no, and commands her to wait, reminding her about the conditions of their duel.</p>
<p>Laphicet and the rest of the crew come in. Phi asks what&#39;s wrong. Is Velvet meditating in there?</p>
<p>Eizen also asks.</p>
<p>Eleanor hears &quot;deep breathing and soft moaning...&quot; Eeee...</p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s guessing that she&#39;s weighing herself. Eleanor&#39;s sweating, knowing that&#39;s not possible.</p>
<p>Eizen thinks it&#39;s makeup, but not Velvet.</p>
<p>Magilou thinks Velvet&#39;s &quot;in great danger.&quot; Oh my god, Magilou. I don&#39;t think so.</p>
<p>Eleanor noticed that Velvet isn&#39;t feeling well...Magilou thinks of having Phi barge in to &quot;test [his] mettle.&quot; Ai ya, Magilou. </p>
<p>Phi goes in, and we see Velvet cleaning!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ibJ4Emd.png alt="velvet cleaning" width=480 height=270 id=hd-liveblog></p>
<p>So Velvet was polishing the window glass and scouring the corners for messes...that inn seriously needs inspection.</p>
<p>Eleanor would have offered to help.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Everyone has their own unique way of cleaning things, so in the end, it&#39;s just faster to do it myself.&quot; She says this with a boastful smile.</p>
<p>We go to the cathedral next.</p>
<p>I noticed after that fishing trip, Laphicet sounds more livelier now.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Looks like Eizen&#39;s up for confession.</p>
<p>The priest notices his eyes as ones &quot;that would belong on the reaper&#39;s face...&quot;</p>
<p>The priest gets frightened quickly! That is the reaper.</p>
<p>Eizen confesses, though, and mentions a Beryl Benito painting. He stole it, didn&#39;t he? But it was a copy.</p>
<p>No, he bought it.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Even if the painting itself was fake, my heartfelt admiration for its beauty was real.&quot;</p>
<p>So he stole from his little sister&#39;s savings to buy the painting. So it wasn&#39;t a lover he was delivering the pot to...</p>
<p>The priest knows that his sister will forgive him.</p>
<p>We talk to the priest again. Phi now has to confess.</p>
<p>Phi tells him about his &quot;secret.&quot; He starts by mentioning a slug he found. So for the sake of science, he sprinkled salt on the slug. No, he put sugar...</p>
<p>...that attracted ants and they came over and probably took care of the slug...Phi&#39;s almost tearing up at this point. <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Laphicet also has one more thing to confess: he poured sugar water into an anthill...uh oh...Phi tears up.</p>
<p>What a bug-lover Phi is!</p>
<p>We go to the castle gates. Everyone assumes Prince Percival&#39;s caught by daemons...I&#39;m laughing a bit at that moment since the prince willingly gave himself up.</p>
<p>The Abbey&#39;s now got a full plate on their hands. One nobleman thinks that the Shepherd &quot;will take a nice tumble&quot; if anything happens to the Prince.</p>
<p>I exchange some Tales coins for outfits and have Eizen wait tables!</p>
<p>But I fail at it! Aaaaaahhhh!</p>
<p>One gossiper mentions the crew&#39;s exploits in Southgand to his friends, also mentioning Eleanor&#39;s actions in Palamedes...</p>
<p>After some Character Cards, I&#39;m off!</p>
<p>More cooking-level-grinding...</p>
<p>After the whole area&#39;s clear of monsters, I head forward to the Aldina Plains passage.</p>

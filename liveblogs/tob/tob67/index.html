<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> I learn just now that I could upload or download my saved files for any PS4 games I&#39;ve played...this might be an interesting feature.</p>
<p><strong>Expedition check:</strong> We get a new treasure, a <strong>Snow Globe of Growth!</strong></p>
<p>Laphicet sees there&#39;s flowers blooming inside!</p>
<p>Magilou and Laphicet&#39;s dialogue is rather humorous, mostly on Magilou&#39;s side.</p>
<p>Now there&#39;s Abbey soldiers in the village...it looks like the village has resigned to accepting Innominat.</p>
<p>One soldier tells us in order to get to Palamedes (or Palamides) we need to pass Manaan Reef.</p>
<p>One woman mentions the reason Mahina the priestess disappeared is because of the Abbey.</p>
<p>One boy mentions <strong>Kamoana</strong>. Who&#39;s Kamoana?</p>
<p>Some people are feeling guilty for making Kamoana feel bad when they mentioned her mother&#39;s priorities... <img class=emojione alt=☹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>The innkeeper&#39;s daughter greets us before the gate to Palamedes. She knows we&#39;re heading there. She doesn&#39;t alert others to us because of Eleanor.</p>
<p>The daughter asks us to look for someone: &quot;a mother and her child.&quot; Could they be the priestesses?</p>
<p><strong>Mahina</strong> and <strong>Kamoana</strong> are the missing people, and Mahina is the priestess who&#39;s not too happy about the Abbey&#39;s takeover of Amenoch&#39;s temple.</p>
<p>So Kamoana went to the temple to look for her mother.</p>
<p>Eleanor vows that she&#39;ll find them.</p>
<p>The innkeeper&#39;s daughter grew up with only her mother just like the missing priestesses...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Let&#39;s be off, Miss Exorcist.&quot;</p>
<p>We now exit the village and are in <strong>Manaan Reef, Wondrous Rock Formations</strong>.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Eleanor plans to find Mahina and Kamoana herself.</p>
<p>Velvet asks why Eleanor&#39;s helping the crew when it&#39;s against the Abbey&#39;s interests. &quot;Little old Eleanor&quot; is curious about the Shepherd&#39;s game plan, and wasn&#39;t well-trusted with the Abbey&#39;s secrets.</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s thinking that the Abbey and Velvet&#39;s crew are headed &quot;to the same destination.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s still suspicious...</p>
<p>Rokurou asks Velvet about therions. Does she know anything about them? Nope. The Shepherd just labelled her as one.</p>
<p>He walks off, not worried about Velvet as long as she&#39;s not worried about that.</p>
<p>But Velvet ponders why Seres freed her in the first place...</p>
<p><strong>Skit:</strong> Bienfu mentions the &quot;at odds&quot; relationship between Velvet and Eleanor, saying they&#39;re &quot;total opposites.&quot; More metaphorical comparisons.</p>
<p>Laphicet also points out Eleanor treats Bienfu with a cold shoulder, and Velvet&#39;s saved Laphicet a few times.</p>
<p>Laphicet and Bienfu are total opposites too.</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s all right if Eleanor doesn&#39;t want to talk to you. I&#39;m here for you, Bienfu. You aren&#39;t alone.&quot; Awww...</p>
<p>Magilou points out what I wrote earlier.</p>
<p>They don&#39;t get what she&#39;s saying...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>With Manaan Reef, it&#39;s hard to tell which path is walkable and which isn&#39;t...</p>
<p>We get into an encounter with <strong>Sea Serpent</strong>s, which look like Snakes of a different color.</p>
<p>There&#39;s also <strong>Hawk</strong>s here as well, and they&#39;re poisoners!</p>
<p>I head to the south area where there&#39;s lots of Katz spirits!</p>
<p>On the map, there&#39;s another code red daemon marked here!</p>
<p>Another expedition gives us a pair of <strong>Devil Wings!</strong></p>
<p>In the area where the code red is, the daemon is so huge!</p>
<p>I brush past him and open the gold chest containing an <strong>Express Pendant!</strong></p>
<p>On a dare, I decide to face him. It&#39;ll make the crew stronger if we win...</p>

<p></p><h2 class=entry-title>Tales of Berseria - Part 67a: Release the Kraken!</h2><p></p>

<p><del>I always wanted to write that...</del></p>
<p>So this huge monster is a <strong>Kraken!</strong></p>
<p>He&#39;s weak against earth attacks but resistant to fire and water artes...</p>
<p>This monster technically guards while casting spells too! Hoo boy...</p>
<p>The benefit of being such a colossal target is that he&#39;s easy to hit! But his defense is rock solid!</p>
<p>We make more hits on him, most of them he&#39;s guarding against! Whenever the Kraken casts his spells though, his defense is down!</p>
<p>Eizen&#39;s out, Laphicet&#39;s in!</p>
<p>Now at a third of his health, the Kraken&#39;s casting his set of spells, KO&#39;ing Rokurou!</p>
<p>We eventually finish the giant squid off!</p>

<p></p><h2 class=entry-title>Tales of Berseria - Part 67: Heading To Palamedes (continued)</h2><p></p>

<p>We move forward to the next area...</p>
<p>We stop, Rokurou mentioning the endless rocky reefy shore.</p>
<p>He also warns us to avoid stepping on sea slugs. He&#39;s not too...open about what would happen if we did step on one.</p>
<p>Then he goes back to thinking about eating them, pickled. Oh, Rokurou...</p>
<p>Eizen warns us not to step on any coral. Yeah, that&#39;s even worse.</p>
<p>Eleanor knows coral is alive and believes coral preservation is important. Velvet thinks that they can be sold for jewelry.</p>
<p>Eizen explains the creation of Manaan is different from Maclir.</p>
<p>Slow erosion and &quot;rock eating&quot; coral called &quot;ravening table&quot; coral caused Manaan Reef to become what it is...</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Ah! So that&#39;s why it tingles every time I touch the coral!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Why didn&#39;t you warn us earlier!?&quot;</p>
<p>We head south to where we can see the vast ocean, and the tall rocks beyond. The place is screenshot-worthy!</p>
<p>Though the monsters around there make it a bit hard to enjoy it.</p>
<p>We see a gold chest with <strong>Asmodeus Earrings</strong> inside!</p>
<p>After tons of battling, we make it back and go to the north area, where another fantastic seascape lies.</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Skit:</strong> It&#39;s an update on Laphicet&#39;s rhinostagros beetle. He feeds them every night before going to bed. He asks Bienfu if he loves bugs. Yes, he does. Laphicet asks him if the beetle&#39;s a rhino or a stag. Bienfu boasts that Magilou found a way to tell. Does it?</p>
<p>If it works, Laphicet has to name the beetle species after Bienfu. He complies. To find out if the beetle&#39;s a rhino or a stag, one has to smell underneath the wings.</p>
<p>Now Rokurou steps in, saying that the scent under a rhino beetle&#39;s wings stink a lot. He asks Eleanor if he wants to smell underneath the beetle&#39;s wings. <strong>No.</strong></p>
<p>Bienfu volunteers. By his reaction, I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s a rhino beetle!</p>
<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> This part was cut from the original liveblog.</p>
<p>Another <strong>skit:</strong> Magilou and Laphicet talk. He wonders what those books she&#39;s wearing are for. One&#39;s a &quot;magic encyclopedia&quot; and another&#39;s a &quot;household ledger,&quot; then a &quot;heavy book for flower pressings,&quot; and a &quot;super popup book&quot; for enemies. But &quot;it&#39;s a pain&quot; for her to close that book!</p>
<p>The front book is actually a cake shaped like a book? What? She&#39;s actually joking. Laphicet&#39;s amazed by the books. </p>
<p>Oh no...Magilou, you are effing creepy...I know what&#39;s coming...oh god... <img class=emojione alt=☹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Eleanor sees what Magilou&#39;s done and is flabbergasted!</p>
<p>Laphicet looks at the books&#39; lock bindings, noting that they&#39;re &quot;popular during the Meliodas dynasty...&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor vows to keep watch on Magilou more.</p>
<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> End of cut part.</p>
<p><strong>Skit:</strong> Laphicet asks about Magilou&#39;s heavy book. It&#39;s...&quot;a collection of Bienfu&#39;s poetry!&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou recites one poem from Bienfu.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not poetry. It&#39;s Bienfu&#39;s diary!</p>
<p>Laphicet notices Magilou&#39;s face has turned &quot;sinister.&quot; Oh my god, Magilou... *smh*</p>
<p>We make it to a warp point!</p>
<p>In the next area, at the far end of the rocky shore, we find another Katz Box!</p>
<p>Now we&#39;re at the last area of the reef...</p>
<p>Rokurou asks Laphicet if he&#39;s found anything based on the compass&#39;s direction so far.</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;Yeah, in the direction of the temple. The [signal]&#39;s getting stronger now.&quot;</p>
<p>After clearing the area of monsters, it&#39;s only a short trip away to the Palamedes Temple!</p>

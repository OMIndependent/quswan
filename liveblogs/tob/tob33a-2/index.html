<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> I wrote this part of the session a week after the previous one.</p>
<p>I go through the cutscene with the Bloodwing Agent again to see if I&#39;ve missed anything, and to see the &quot;favorite foods&quot; skit again.</p>
<p>I have the party battle several rounds to build them up to a formidable group.</p>
<p>I&#39;m a bit more cautious in battles this time...</p>
<p>I head forward to Galles Lake Road.</p>
<p>We look downhill: there&#39;s one &quot;code red daemon,&quot; a giant gorilla-like daemon with a club!</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s not bothering with the daemon below. She&#39;s making a wise decision. Rokurou, though, wants more action on his plate. He then makes his case.</p>
<p>Laphicet thinks that &quot;Teresa and the legates could probably take it on.&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen deduces that since the Abbey is very strong, it&#39;s a good reason to fight the daemon, to build more strength in preparation for fighting them.</p>
<p>Velvet &quot;concedes her point.&quot; But, we have to be prepared before fighting this guy. Eizen agrees.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;I&#39;d rather not get myself killed due to inadequate preparation.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou tells Velvet not to worry a lot, and promises to &quot;keep [her] safe [himself]&quot; if she wants to pick a fight with the code red daemon.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;I don&#39;t recall asking for your protection.&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;You don&#39;t need to.&quot;</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>A wolf almost catches us unawares! Luckily, we didn&#39;t get into a surprise attack!</p>
<p>We check around for more Katz Spirits before saving at a nearby point before the path to Galles Lake Road.</p>
<p>We arrive at <strong>Galles Lake Road, the Yawning Wetlands</strong>. The scenery here looks gorgeous...</p>
<p>There&#39;s a lot of monsters roaming around the land...</p>
<p>We pick a fight with <strong>Pixie</strong>s...they&#39;re usually light-elemental spellcasters, vulnerable to martial-type artes.</p>
<p>Snakes still keep chasing us...</p>
<p>We jump to higher plateaus, and see over a vine-covered boulder.</p>
<p>Rokurou burns away the vines with a sweep of his hand before rolling the boulder over to the lake...</p>
<p>Jump, jump, jump, jump over to the other side of the lake...</p>
<p>We see a skunk-like monster, which is actually a <strong>Marmot!</strong></p>
<p>Afterwards, we head to the north end of the Lake Road. There&#39;s a circle and an X marked at a point on the map in this area. This must be where another code red daemon is...</p>
<p>A few battles and some scavenging later, we jump to another plateau and roll another boulder into the water.</p>
<p>I see the code red daemon on the far side of the wetland, a dark aura emanating around them...</p>
<p>The code red daemon&#39;s a Medusa or a Naga Queen of sorts...</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I do my best to avoid the code red daemon while collecting more Katz Spirits...</p>
<p>There&#39;s also a chest of the far end of where the daemon is...</p>
<p>It&#39;s so tempting to get the chest without going face-to-face against the daemon...</p>
<p>After getting the chest&#39;s contents, I leap away from the daemon&#39;s line of sight and head southeast...</p>
<p>I also pick up <strong>Calcite Boots</strong> from another silver chest!</p>
<p>We&#39;re now almost close to where Mendi&#39;s at.</p>
<p>More fights with Pixies...</p>
<p>We head to the southwest area, where we take the loot we missed here.</p>
<p>There&#39;s plenty of Marmots here as well...</p>
<p>Luckily, I didn&#39;t take this route since there&#39;s a wide gap of water here.</p>
<p>We double back to reach that area.</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We make it! There&#39;s a Katz box situated in one of the plateaus around here.</p>
<p>After rolling a boulder into the water, I jump to the plateau where the Katz box is, barely dodging a battle with a Marmot!</p>
<p>We free the Katz and we get an <strong>Angel Halo!</strong></p>
<p>While rolling a boulder, I spot another silver chest from afar!</p>
<p>But as I make land there, a whole fleet of monsters chase us!</p>
<p>We get an <strong>Aqua Ring!</strong></p>
<p>After tons of battles, we head back to where Mendi&#39;s held hostage...</p>
<p>But, a surprise comes in the form of two guards, or <strong>Mercenaries</strong>. Even Rokurou notices.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;What on earth are guards doing here?&quot;</p>
<p>They summon two malakhim!</p>
<p>Eizen notices it too.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;They&#39;re no ordinary sellswords!&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;m thinking they must have been former exorcists, but quit the Abbey.</p>
<p>I have Rokurou take care of the <strong>Primal Python</strong>s, their malakhim, first.</p>
<p><a name=6></a></p>
<hr>
<p>After a semi-long battle, Rokurou asks what or who they were guarding. Velvet assumes the same thing I&#39;m thinking: Mendi. Why, though?</p>
<p>We get a <strong>Courier&#39;s Ventite</strong> as a reward...</p>
<p>Turning a corner, we see a camp, and a few people sleeping around the pitched roofs there.</p>
<p>The camp&#39;s full of miners. But, what are they mining?</p>
<p>A man with a shovel&#39;s asking us if we took care of the mercenaries meant to watch the camp.</p>
<p>I wonder what these red gems are in these crates?</p>
<p>All the people here with pickaxes and shovels are still on guard...</p>
<p>Velvet asks where Mendi is. Mendi&#39;s here, and is relieved that he can go home.</p>
<p>Eizen&#39;s surprised that the Abbey, or another group, had him mine for vermillion ore.</p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s curious about what vermillion ore is. Laphicet explains. It&#39;s meant as a medicine, or an ingredient in medicine, but it&#39;s poisonous too...</p>
<p>So the people holding Mendi captive were making him make <strong>Nectar.</strong> </p>
<p>Vermillion ore&#39;s like a dangerous drug since it&#39;s so addictive...</p>
<p>Velvet asks if Mendi can make it out on his own. He can. The mining captives also join him back on the way to town.</p>
<p><a name=7></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Speaking to a man nearby, I learn that vermillion ore&#39;s red because they&#39;re naturally formed by volcanoes...he also tells us that a &quot;fire-breathing dragon&quot; used to reside in Galles Lake Road.</p>
<p>It seems we actually freed the miners from the mercs who forced them to make Nectar. Yes! For a second there, I thought they were from the same guild the mercs were from.</p>
<p>Not taking any chances, I use up a Holy Bottle to avoid the endless encounters on the way back...</p>
<p>I save outside the road to the wetlands and make our long way back...</p>
<p>We get huge treasure from another expedition: <strong>Twins&#39; Clothes</strong>, and a <strong>Pirate Flag!</strong> Who were the twins, though?</p>
<p>I read dialogue between Laphicet and Rokurou explaining the Twins&#39; Clothes. They were worn by mimics. Rokurou does not know what a mimic is. Laphicet explains.</p>
<p>Rokurou even makes a malapropism here: &quot;a nasty pair of dogs,&quot; or a nasty paradox.</p>
<p>A few battles around the gates of Loegres, and we head for the tavern...</p>
<p><strong>Skit:</strong> Eizen and Rokurou point out that the Shepherd and the Abbey have gained enough power to &quot;<strong>be</strong> the Empire now.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet loathes the idea of the Shepherd as &quot;the Savior of Humanity.&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen and Velvet mention the Shepherd&#39;s speech about the &quot;blessings of Innominat.&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen also says that malakhim aren&#39;t sure of who or what Empyreans actually are outside of legends and tales...</p>
<p>He also wonders why the Shepherd calls <strong>Innominat</strong> the &quot;fifth Empyrean&quot; when there&#39;s only four of them.</p>
<p>Laphicet also doesn&#39;t know about this growing development.</p>
<p>Velvet advises caution, knowing that the Shepherd can do anything, even lie, to get what he wants. She&#39;s also doubtful that the Shepherd has bound a god to his whim...</p>
<p>Eizen knows that the Abbey could make that possible, saying not to underestimate them. If an organization can submit a god to their will, that&#39;s a really big indicator of how strong they are, or could be.</p>
<p>Hence why Velvet&#39;s using the shadow guild to bring them down.</p>
<p><a name=8></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We talk to a blond woman in black and red outside the tavern with a beast icon above her head. She rewards us for taking care of the masked daemon bat from Hadlow Hollow.</p>
<p>We head inside and talk to the woman in black.</p>
<p>We take on the ambush stopping job next, which calls on us to stop a planned ambush for the <strong>Royal Medical Society</strong>...</p>
<p>Laphicet and Eizen give a background of the RMS, who are funded by ordinary people.</p>
<p>Rokurou asks good questions here:<br>
<strong>Why would anyone want to ambush a group of doctors?</strong><br>
<strong>And why would a shadow guild protect them for?</strong></p>
<p>My guesses are that they may have aided in a few Bloodwings, or may have done some work for them...</p>

<p>Now a rematch with Jude since I failed to have him use his Mystic Arte on us!</p>
<p>It&#39;s still humorous to see Jude as a talking pengyon though...</p>
<p>For this round, Jude unleashes his Mystic Arte on Laphicet: <strong>Final Fury!</strong></p>
<p>I switch to fire artes for Rokurou. If Jude&#39;s health were a bit lower, I would&#39;ve gotten the Mystic Arte finish!</p>
<p>Velvet tells the innkeeper to keep the talking pengyon rumor to themselves.</p>
<p>In the sanctuary, one soldier mentions that the liberated malakhim might&#39;ve been &quot;servants of the Empyrean...&quot;</p>
<p>The elder&#39;s thinking about Haria Village&#39;s fall to malevolence, or as he calls it, daemonblight. And more victim blaming from one of the townspeople there.</p>
<p>Eleanor jumps in, saying that no one deserved that! Yeah, I agree.</p>
<p>The elder shames the townswoman, telling her not to talk bad about dead people. He mentions that he had a friend in Haria and that &quot;[their] islands were her home.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Perhaps I have no right to say anything here, but please...don&#39;t ever lose that kind heart of yours. That&#39;s the best way you can honor the memory of Haria&#39;s people.&quot;</p>
<p>The townswoman is still thinking like a servant of the Abbey.</p>
<p>We talk to the priest again. He&#39;s talking to Bienfu.</p>
<p><strong>Bienfu:</strong> (whispering) &quot;Why are you whispering?&quot;</p>
<p>The priest blames the crew for not repenting.</p>
<p><strong>Bienfu:</strong> &quot;I don&#39;t know what to tell you...You&#39;ll have to take it up with them.&quot;</p>
<p>The priest is afraid that the crew might clobber him if he even tried to talk to them.</p>
<p>The priest tells Bienfu to confess something &quot;legitimate!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Priest:</strong> &quot;If you don&#39;t hurry up, I&#39;ll put a curse on you!&quot; Oh my goodness...</p>
<p>Bienfu apologizes and asks him for forgiveness.</p>
<p>Nope. Then Bienfu turns on the waterworks and tells him to &quot;repent for being such a petty mean [...] priest!&quot;</p>

<hr>
<p>I talk to a Teresa devotee under the boardwalk with two other people. He tells us why he likes her. Laphicet don&#39;t care, but he asks him why he&#39;s a fan: Teresa&#39;s &quot;tinge of sadness.&quot; The fan gets poetic about her, and he mentions her in her swimsuit.</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;This guy...is really, really creepy.&quot; You said it, Laphicet. Eleanor agrees. Even Velvet pities Teresa&#39;s job a bit.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Velvet, Eleanor! Quickly! Avert your gaze! If you keep looking at him with disgust and disdain...&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet agrees and they walk off...</p>
<p>I play a geoboard mini game and win Crying Glasses...</p>
<p>Inside the tavern, I talk to a promoter who warns about Yseult&#39;s pickiness in comedy.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;I love a good challenge! Believe it or not, I&#39;ve always been interested in theatre. I thought it would be good for building courage.&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou suggests she talks while Rokurou responds.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Okay, but if you start giving me some jabs am I permitted to counterattack?&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;As long as it&#39;s not with your sword.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou laughs creepily.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s not exactly reassuring!&quot;</p>
<p>Poor Magilou...</p>
<p>Magilou introduces herself and Rokurou as &quot;Magilou &amp; Rokurou.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou starts giving advice on sword polishing: the sea air&#39;s bad for them.</p>
<p>Magilou wants to eat more seafood.</p>
<p>Rokurou jumps in, ruining her cues...and giving more advice on cutting fish.</p>
<p>Magilou says swordfish, Rokurou jumps, his big grinning face lighting up!</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Swordfish! Heh, now if there&#39;s one fish out there I&#39;d love to duel at least once, it&#39;s that one for sure!&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou explains his joke about swordfish &quot;being like his rival.&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou&#39;s done.</p>
<p>Then she mentions more fish, especially a &quot;pufferfish&quot; and Rokurou jumps again!</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Speaking of round animalsâ€”okay, I once met this round looking guy named Arma Dylan! I&#39;ve never seen anyone so round before or even since!&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou jumps in and tells Rokurou &quot;[he&#39;s] a nightmare to work with.&quot; Everyone&#39;s laughing...</p>
<p>The promoter thought that Rokurou&#39;s act was &quot;convincing.&quot; Plus, Rokurou&#39;s &quot;didn&#39;t need to act much.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;No. You&#39;re just a free spirit...&quot;</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I wander around the docks before warping back to Stonebury and talking to the promoter there.</p>
<p>Magilou doesn&#39;t think Eizen has the talent to pull off a comedy act...</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;You just underestimate me. I have my own sense of humor.&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou drops the <a href=http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/I_have_a_bad_feeling_about_this>George Lucas trademark line</a> again...</p>
<p>Eizen decides to play the fool.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;I&#39;ll have everyone dying from laughter the way only a reaper can.&quot; Be like Batman, Eizen. Deadpan humor is your best quality, not playing a &quot;fool.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Hi there! We&#39;re your friendly comedy duo: Death by Laughter.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;<strong>Magikazam!</strong>&quot; Hee...</p>
<p>Eizen explains &quot;rakugo,&quot; and namedrops Hatsuan Kuma-san, Oya-san, Yotaro the fool...</p>
<p>Magilou tells him &quot;speed&quot; is important. Eizen thinks &quot;comedy that forgets the old classics has no future.&quot; My goodness, where is this going?</p>
<p>Eizen tuts at Magilou. She&#39;s not happy.</p>
<p>Magilou pulls a suspicious face. Eizen clicks at her again.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;If you respect comedy, then respect my authority!&quot;</p>
<p>Maybe I should put those police glasses on Magilou and make a meme out of it someday...</p>
<p>Eizen clicks his tongue and wants to &quot;imitate a clock.&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou&#39;s done. Eizen grins.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Whooooo! It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve worked so hard.&quot;</p>
<p>The promoter thinks they&#39;re...okay. But he finds Eizen scary. That&#39;s why he should play the serious guy like Batman.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Now another <strong>skit</strong> plays, where Magilou judges everyone to be... &quot;hopelessly unfunny!&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s a &quot;little pissed off&quot; by how Magilou said that. Magilou decides to have Bienfu as her partner for their next act.</p>
<p>&quot;Elysian Thunder?&quot;</p>
<p>Or &quot;thunder in the form of relentless ad libbing...&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;You guys are really in sync.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Couldn&#39;t you two just have teamed up from the start?&quot;</p>
<p>We talk to a man who mentions a &quot;terrible accident.&quot; He mentions a carriage falling into a ravine. The passengers were on their way to be tried for heresy.</p>
<p>Magilou knows about these people, for some reason. She mentions they found everyone except one. A girl, and she was held captive by them...</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;There were rumors that a strange spirit saved her life.&quot; But she doesn&#39;t believe that...</p>
<p>The man heard about this story when he was younger, and is &quot;surprised&quot; Magilou knows about what happened to the girl.</p>
<p>She might&#39;ve been a daemon now.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Exactly how old are you, Magilou?&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;As old as my tongue and a little older than my teeth, hee hee!&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;From your reaction, I can at least tell you&#39;re not my age...&quot;</p>
<p>I need to buy more Inoph Bottles...</p>

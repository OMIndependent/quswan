<p>The code red we fought at Hexen Isle isn&#39;t on the bounty list...</p>
<p>We sail for Yseult, then warp to Haria Village, where it&#39;s repopulated again...</p>
<p>The merchant thanks Imperial soldiers for helping to rebuild the village. The soldiers say it &quot;goes against reason, but [...] without that kind of enthusiasm, humanity would have no future.&quot;</p>
<p>One citizen&#39;s worried about the Boss Troll, who&#39;s been taken care of...</p>
<p>There&#39;s a Bloodwing agent squatting on the edge of the inn&#39;s deck...</p>
<p>A son&#39;s worried about his dad staying in Haria, while a mother who didn&#39;t want to go back has a daughter who&#39;s coming along...</p>
<p>An Amenoch (and Innominat) devotee is tending to flowers on the trellis. She still believes in her traditions to Amenoch...Eleanor&#39;s hopeful too. She tells us that soldiers will be patrolling from time to time to watch over Haria.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s pretty tolerant coming from the people who banned Amenoch worship in the first place.&quot;<br>
<strong>Believer:</strong> &quot;Those who served under Lady Teresa have a strong sense of justice. They&#39;ll protect anyone, regardless of belief.&quot; These soldiers are potential <em>Tales</em> protagonists...</p>
<p>She mentions Teresa hasn&#39;t been around for awhile. She also warns us about the Lord of Calamity as well, and tells us to &quot;stay safe.&quot; That&#39;s a big irony...</p>
<p>A history student&#39;s reading about the Empyreans.</p>
<p>An unvoiced youth and another history student are trying to restore Amenoch&#39;s traditions by finding any remaining devotees of Amenoch.</p>
<p>Rokurou asks if the inn&#39;s going to be reopened...</p>
<p>It will be, as there are people coming from everywhere to go to Palamedes, and will stop by Haria on the way there.</p>
<p>The history student does double duty as inn chef, since she has a huge interest in Southgand&#39;s cuisine.</p>
<p>Laphicet asks what food will she cook. She lists them: moussaka, southern-style mango fried rice, papaya, sukiyaki...mmm, mango fried rice.</p>
<p>The unvoiced youth tells us he&#39;s going &quot;to preserve the traditions, rites, and foods of the village.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;I wish you luck.&quot;</p>
<p>Now that Amenoch is awake, that means they can hear the history student&#39;s prayers...</p>

<hr>
<p>Behind a house in Yseult, a Bloodwing agent tells us about a chest that &quot;nobody can open&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;If it won&#39;t open, why doesn&#39;t anyone just smash it apart?&quot; Oh my god Rokurou, <a href="https://youtu.be/CmRnkTRVNW8?t=391">he talks like Fidget when it comes to locked chests</a>.</p>
<p>The Bloodwing agent tells us that many exorcists tried that. Nothing worked.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Ohhhh, now you&#39;re talking my language.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;It might be treasure from the far continent.&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet asks if he knows something. Eizen quiets him. Oh boy...</p>
<p>Velvet don&#39;t care, as usual.</p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s suspicious. So&#39;s Velvet.</p>
<p>Eizen does suspect it came from the far continent. Laphicet&#39;s in awe! He has some hints why...</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Oh ho, do go on, I&#39;m all ears!&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Let&#39;s go give it a look. If we really can&#39;t get it to open, I&#39;ll cut right through it.&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen, though, knows how to open that chest.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;In fact, Aifread was the one who figured it out.&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet figures it out.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s where he found Siegfried.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s not letting either Abbey or Bloodwings take whatever&#39;s in that chest.</p>
<p>Now we warp to Haria Village, and run to the east gate!</p>
<p>At the central part of the reef, we see the chest, which looks like another gold chest.</p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s the first to spot it, and we run to it.</p>
<p>Magilou asks how the chest could be opened.</p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s offering to cut the chest. Eleanor&#39;s not having that.</p>
<p>Eizen mentions that it needs to be opened by password, which is &quot;wealth&quot; in the far continent&#39;s language.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;<strong>Van Eltia.</strong>&quot; It unlocks!</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;What, that&#39;s all it took? Talk about anticlimactic.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;I didn&#39;t know the ship&#39;s name came from [there].&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Yeah. There was an engineer who helped design the technology from there. He probably supplied [the chest.] And by that bizarre twist of fate, Siegfried came into Aifread&#39;s hands.&quot;</p>

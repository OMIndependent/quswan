<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>I was building up most of the party&#39;s cooking skill levels. So far, it seems to be passable.</p>
<p><strong>Expedition check:</strong> Found new treasure and a new location: a set of islands that don&#39;t use items in combat! Another <em>Tales</em> game&#39;s referenced here...</p>
<p>The new treasure the scout crew found is a <strong>Spiria Core Crystal</strong>! </p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s interested in &quot;cutting&quot; the stones, thinking the gems&#39; cross-sections are prettier. Laphicet asks why. Rokurou has a tendency to cut everything that&#39;s &quot;hard.&quot; Stones and metal mostly...</p>
<p>After a few battles, we head to the port!</p>
<p><strong>Port Cadnix, Mining Base</strong> is the port&#39;s name.</p>
<p>I also find another Katz Box, and rescue the little Katz there!</p>
<p>Across the way, I also open a chest with a <strong>Tranquillo</strong> ribbon for Eleanor!</p>
<p>I look at the port beyond. From a distance, we see Shigure and two exorcists!</p>
<p><strong>Expedition check:</strong> We get another recipe: a <strong>Berserker&#39;s Palmier</strong>!</p>
<p>I go to a weapon salesman, who&#39;s surprised that everyone in the port&#39;s vanished!</p>
<p>With Rokurou as leader, I slowly walk to the smug legate and his troops!</p>
<p>Morgrim points out that we took care of the exorcists in the mine.</p>
<p>Shigure decides to test Rokurou&#39;s new weapon out!</p>
<p>Morgrim flees into her vessel for this fight again!</p>
<p>Laphicet tells Rokurou they can take of the exorcists, and &quot;to go and find his victory [against Shigure].&quot; Rokurou thanks him.</p>
<p>Velvet and Eizen make gazes at each other, strategizing at this point...</p>
<p><strong>Shigure:</strong> &quot;Alright, let&#39;s get down to business!&quot;</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Now Shigure has new weaknesses and strengths! He&#39;s weak to fire, but strong against earth!</p>
<p><strong>Shigure:</strong> &quot;Better not die too quickly on me! I want this to be fun! C&#39;mon, bro, don&#39;t hold back!&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;<strong>Shut up!</strong> Don&#39;t play games with me!&quot;</p>
<p>Shigure&#39;s not unleashing his Mystic Arte...</p>
<p>As soon as I change strategies, he unleashes it: <strong>Rangetsu Eagle!!!</strong></p>
<p>Afterwards, it&#39;s now a revive-and-fight match, but Shigure&#39;s health goes down, and he unleashes his Mystic Arte once again!</p>
<p>Rokurou feels the full brunt of his brother&#39;s <strong>Rangetsu Eagle</strong>, and Kurogane&#39;s daggers are broken!</p>
<p><strong>Shigure:</strong> &quot;You put up a good fight, I&#39;ll give you that. But you&#39;re a frickin&#39; daemon. Shouldn&#39;t ya bring more to the table than that &#39;pretty damn good Rangetsu style&#39;?&quot;</p>
<p>Oh wow, put-downs... /sarcasm</p>
<p>Rokurou, riled up, throws away one of his daggers, and fights him again!</p>
<p>His daemon eye shines and he charges again!</p>
<p>Holy heck, <strong>his hand!!</strong></p>
<p>Rokurou tries to get the final blow in, but Shigure dodges it!</p>
<p>Eizen and Velvet charge in!</p>
<p>Rokurou gets thrown to the ground!</p>
<p>Shigure&#39;s impressed by Rokurou&#39;s surprise attack! He loves this fight!</p>
<p>He tosses the proto-Stormhowl at Rokurou&#39;s feet.</p>
<p>Shigure calls the battle a day and gives everyone an ultimatum!</p>
<p><strong>Shigure:</strong> &quot;If y&#39;all want any hope of beating me, come find me once you&#39;re more skilled and better armed!&quot; We will.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>And Rokurou makes a resolution of revenge, not unlike Khan Noonien Singh&#39;s...</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;I&#39;ll cut you down...No matter how many times I lose, no matter how many years it takes...&quot;</p>
<p>Shigure&#39;s even more impressed. He really wants such a fight. He compliments Rokurou&#39;s &quot;vicious, perfect face.&quot;</p>
<p>He laughs mightily and leaves Rokurou hanging...</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s in shock at Shigure&#39;s bloodlust.</p>
<p>Morgrim comes out and tells Eleanor to worry more about herself, since &quot;the entire Abbey knows by now that [she&#39;s] a traitor.&quot; She runs off.</p>
<p>Laphicet points out the obvious: Shigure is not a man one should mess with.</p>
<p>Eizen knows that the exorcists, especially the legates, are strong.</p>
<p>But Velvet&#39;s determined to beat Shigure and the entire Abbey, no matter what.</p>
<p>The <em>Van Eltia</em>&#39;s arrived just after Shigure&#39;s left port.</p>
<p>Kurogane&#39;s there. He asks Rokurou if he could join the crew.</p>
<p>Kurogane vows to make a sword stronger than Stormhowl...</p>
<p><strong>Kurogane:</strong> &quot;But for another blade to beat Stormhowl...its wielder must be a swordsman of unmatched skill.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou thinks about it and asks Eizen. </p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;If there&#39;s not enough [room on the ship], make someone wear it.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou laughs. It&#39;s the first time in a while he&#39;s done that.</p>
<p>Magilou reminds us of our mission: to find <strong>Grimoirh</strong> in <strong>Yseult</strong> in <strong>Southgand</strong> to translate the book we found in the villa!</p>
<p>We receive our rewards from the battle with Shigure...</p>

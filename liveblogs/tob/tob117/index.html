<p>Now back to where Magilou is...</p>
<p>Magilou&#39;s spent...malevolence is closing in on her...</p>
<p>Melchior comes.</p>
<p><strong>Melchior:</strong> &quot;How many times do you plan to destroy your heart and rebuild your own...Magilou?&quot;</p>
<p>107 times she tried that!? <strong>108!?</strong></p>
<p>Magilou stumbles to get up...</p>
<p><strong>Melchior:</strong> &quot;Did I not tell you it would require an iron will, as indomitable as the very trees that live and die across millennia?&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Like you, I suppose...or that [malak] over there...?&quot;<br>
<strong>Melchior:</strong> &quot;That is the foundation of an ideal world, one free from man&#39;s sins.&quot;</p>
<p>Melchior finishes her off...</p>
<p>Magilou&#39;s not done yet. She tells the malak next to him that his &quot;companion&quot; is alive.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Chasing a terrifying daemon girl, he has learned the immensity of the seas and weathered the dry wastes of the land. Those people, they&#39;re different from us...<strong>despite the pain, the anguish, they embrace the life they&#39;ve been given! They live undaunted by the ugliness of the world!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>The malak reacts. Melchior tries to stop her! </p>
<p>Melchior does sound a bit like Drosselmeyer at this moment here...</p>
<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> In a way, so is Magilou.</p>
<p>Magilou admits her companions get in her skin...</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s why...I intend to see how all of this ends...I won&#39;t be satisfied until I do!&quot;</p>
<p>Melchior calls Magilou &quot;his greatest failure.&quot; Wow...*smh*</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Gosh...funny just how little I care...&quot; Owch...</p>
<p>Melchior prepares Magilou&#39;s unprepared finale...and...<strong>what the heck!?</strong></p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Velvet and the gang&#39;s there. She smiles so joyously.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Let me guess... we came at a good time?&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;You&#39;re late! Because of you, I had to have a really boring conversation.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh my god...<strong>yes!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Melchior:</strong> &quot;So you came face-to-face with Innominat.&quot; And brought him down a few pegs.</p>
<p><strong>Melchior:</strong> &quot;If so, then you must know that your quest for revenge is utterly meaningless.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>I know why sadness fills the world, and I know how deep are the burdens of sin. I tried to abandon my memories of Arthur...and Laphi, to cut myself off from it all, and end this tragedy. It&#39;s...it&#39;s what they would&#39;ve wanted...but that&#39;s exactly why I can&#39;t forgive them...Not Artorius, not Innominat. I know my heart is ugly and full of contradictions. But those days we spent together</strong> [...] <strong>they&#39;re proof that I... that all of us... were truly alive. That&#39;s why no matter how hard, no matter how sad it gets...</strong> <strong><em>I will take my vengeance to the very end!</em></strong>&quot;</p>
<p>She&#39;s back...she&#39;s <strong>truly</strong> back!</p>
<p>Melchior&#39;s not having it...it&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve seen him lose his composure.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>You take my family, turn me into a monster, and you want my soul too?</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>She pulls out her arm...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Remember this well. <strong>The Lord of Calamity never gives up, not even in the face of death.</strong>&quot; She&#39;s comfortable with her moniker now...</p>
<p>Melchior keeps calling her names, asking her if &quot;she has no shame for her sins&quot; at all.</p>
<p>Magilou laughs all the way to the skies!</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Let me in on this! I lost a bet and I&#39;ve got some anger to work out!&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet asks her if she&#39;s able to fight.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> (points) &quot;Who do you think I am?...I am the [...] witch Magilou, scourge of self-righteous exorcists! <strong>Now face the wrath of Magilou Mayvin!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The fight is on!</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Everyone, sorry to have worried you!&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;I wasn&#39;t.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Didn&#39;t realize you were someone who needed looking after.&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Me neither.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;This is our way of saying we trust you.&quot;<br>
<strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou&#39;s not the type to be pleased by the heartwarming talk...but she says, in her own way, she misses us...</p>
<p>Oh god, even in battle, Melchior can warp!</p>
<p>I have Rokurou take care of the malak.</p>
<p>Now for Melchior...</p>
<p>Now he&#39;s unleashed his Violet Storm! I better be careful of that one!</p>
<p>I switch to Velvet and with Magilou subbing in for Rokurou, we finish Melchior!</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>Tell Artorius and Innominat. They took something precious from me. I&#39;ll never forgive them for that.</strong>&quot;<br>
<strong>Melchior:</strong> &quot;The annals of history are stained with evil people like you. You spread havoc and destruction, all to satisfy your own ends, a dark font for malevolence. <strong>You&#39;re a daemon lord, the irredeemable embodiment of sin!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Melchior does talk like a fundie...</p>
<p>Eizen asks Melchior where&#39;s Aifread...his teeth gritting like a pirate&#39;s, though his glasses offset that. Melchior&#39;s saying nothing.</p>
<p>Phi senses Innominat&#39;s presence!</p>
<p>Bienfu can&#39;t seal the rift!</p>
<p>Melchior summons his bodyguard: Aifread! </p>
<p>But Zaveid fires Siegfried, the blast kicking Melchior and Aifread back into the rift! </p>
<p>The rift&#39;s sealed.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Zaveid:</strong> &quot;Carelessness will get you killed.&quot; It&#39;s about time!<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;You ruined the moment.&quot;</p>
<p>He walks toward him.</p>
<p><strong>Zaveid:</strong> &quot;Don&#39;t you mean, &#39;Thanks for saving us Zaveid, you&#39;re my hero and role model?&#39;&quot;</p>
<p>Phi smiles, and thanks him.</p>
<p>Zaveid tells us we&#39;re in <strong>Hexen Isle</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Is there a way out?&quot;<br>
<strong>Zaveid:</strong> &quot;There is now I busted my way in.&quot;</p>
<p>Phi turns around, there&#39;s the lone malak, his &quot;friend&quot;.</p>
<p>Zaveid approaches him and asks him to join the party, mentioning &quot;scary&quot; dragons.</p>
<p><strong>Malak child:</strong> &quot;Yeah. That sounds scary.&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen&#39;s like, &quot;Do whatever you like.&quot;</p>
<p>Technically, we&#39;re at <strong>The Calix, Realm of Testing.</strong></p>
<p>I save and stop here. Whoo, what a session!</p>

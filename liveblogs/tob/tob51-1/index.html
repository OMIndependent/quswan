<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> Since I played through this part of the session before and after midnight, I&#39;m splitting this part into two.</p>
<p>After a few warm-up battles, we enter deeper into the cavern...</p>
<p>At the end of the passage, I see Rokurou and the Swordbreaker at a forge...</p>
<p>Look at all the blades!</p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s awed at the scrapped swords! They look finely crafted, but probably cast aside because they weren&#39;t strong enough to break Stormhowl...</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s what happens when the legendary blacksmith Kurogane toils so hard he forgets to die.&quot;<br>
<strong>Kurogane:</strong> &quot;I gave up everything, thinking of nothing else but forging a sword that could surpass Stormhowl. And before I knew it...&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;...you had traded your humanity for daemonhood.&quot;<br>
<strong>Kurogane:</strong> &quot;I see I&#39;m not the only one. So great was your grudge against your brother...the inheritor of Stormhowl.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou asks if Kurogane could forge him a new sword.</p>
<p>Kurogane tried, but he couldn&#39;t make a sword fit to fight Stormhowl.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;I&#39;ll put it like this: no matter how much you&#39;ve failed across the centuries, you&#39;ve never broken. I&#39;m the same way. If anything can break Shigure and his God Blade, it&#39;s the bitterness I carry.&quot;</p>
<p>But Kurogane feels inspired by the match between Rokurou and Shigure! He decides to make a new sword!</p>
<p>Laphicet asks if brightstone&#39;s needed. Nope.</p>
<p>Rokurou &quot;takes it from the top&quot; and beheads Kurogane! It turns out Kurogane&#39;s armor could be good material for the sword!</p>
<p>Kurogane&#39;s like Alphonse...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;You see something new every day.&quot; Yep.</p>
<p>They&#39;re going to remake the &quot;imitation&quot; Stormhowl! Rokurou refuses, deciding to keep that one &quot;as a reminder&quot; for his mistakes.</p>
<p>So Rokurou decides to dual wield, a secret passed down his family for generations!</p>
<p>If I make another FMA reference, please stop me.</p>
<p>Kurogane accepts that Rokurou wants two shortswords this time.</p>
<p>Kurogane lights his detached head on fire and forges! Laphicet&#39;s creeped out...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Everyone waits outside the workshop...</p>
<p>Eleanor doesn&#39;t understand Rokurou or Kurogane. His tale is for another story...</p>
<p>Velvet questions Eleanor&#39;s perception of daemons now. Eleanor sees Rokurou and Kurogane as &quot;passionate.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet is also passionate in her purpose &quot;ever since [the Shepherd] used [her] brother as a sacrifice.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor waves her grudge off as &quot;typical daemon nonsense!&quot; If only you&#39;d have seen what Velvet&#39;s seen...</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Yes, sometimes cold, painful decisions need to be made to protect the many...but they&#39;d never stoop to human sacrifice.&quot; Oh my goodness... *smh*</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Ask the precious Shepherd yourself. Ask him just what he did three years ago.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s still on the fence with her loyalties...</p>
<p>Eizen tells us the <em>Van Eltia</em>&#39;s coming.</p>
<p>He also gives us more info on the legate Shigure: <strong>He&#39;s the Shepherd&#39;s personal bodyguard.</strong></p>
<p>Eizen adds that to take care of him, he needs to be taken care of alone. But he&#39;s thinking practically knowing that Rokurou can&#39;t take him down alone, despite whatever he says.</p>
<p>Eizen decides to take Shigure out once &quot;Rokurou creates an opening.&quot; Hoo boy...</p>
<p>Velvet still finds Rokurou useful for her revenge quest.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Rokurou&#39;s not really a guy to care about the big picture...he&#39;ll get over it. Legate or criminal, I&#39;ll knock down anything that stands in my way. And I&#39;ll use any means necessary.&quot;</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Magilou had Bienfu recon ahead to look for the port. Velvet&#39;s pitying Bienfu.</p>
<p>Magilou considers Kurogane &quot;a character,&quot; mentioning his sacrifice. He&#39;s that devoted...</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s still on high alert with the word &quot;sacrifice,&quot; calling it &quot;necessary sacrifice.&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou&#39;s not at ease at how the result will end up.</p>
<p>Magilou also brings up an illuminating question: &quot;<strong>If what you give is mere meat for a god&#39;s morbid lunch, could there be a more trivial sacrifice? But if the offering is one&#39;s own body and soul, even a single hair can be portentious.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> (to Velvet) &quot;There&#39;s never a dull day hanging around with you.&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s still pondering over all the things that have happened since the Ravine...poor Laphicet...</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;How do those two find it in themselves to go so far?&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet says it&#39;s because they&#39;re daemons. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the reason why.</p>
<p>Laphicet calls their passion &quot;scary,&quot; but &quot;admires&quot; Kurogane&#39;s and Rokurou&#39;s determination. But, he doesn&#39;t have any goal like that yet. Velvet tells him that he will have something like that in time, but not to risk his life for it.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> (to Laphicet) &quot;You deserve a normal life.&quot; What is &quot;normal&quot; in Velvet&#39;s view?</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;But never mind. Just the foolish ramblings of a daemon girl.&quot;</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Bienfu alerts us that praetors are on the prowl! They&#39;re probably looking for us!</p>
<p>Velvet decides to face them, and orders Eleanor to join along.</p>
<p>Eizen warns Velvet that if Eleanor is gone, Laphicet becomes a daemon!</p>
<p>Velvet knows, but she wants all hands on deck!</p>
<p>Magilou trolls Velvet about Eleanor&#39;s fall from grace as &quot;a noble, upstanding exorcist!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;How quickly one falls when entering Velvet&#39;s dark orbit.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Ask me if I care.&quot;</p>
<p>We save and return to the forge...</p>
<p>...but we can&#39;t go back in.</p>
<p>Now we have to fight the exorcists!</p>
<p>We traverse the tunnel, and all of the exorcist praetors now label Eleanor with the word &quot;traitor.&quot;</p>
<p>All the <strong>Spear Orderlies</strong> have a power link. Are they malakhim?</p>
<p>We get them! Eleanor feels guilt at this point. She knows Velvet&#39;s &quot;testing&quot; her.</p>
<p>She duels the praetor!</p>

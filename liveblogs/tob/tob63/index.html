<p><a href=https://youtu.be/lwV0ckwSXcg>Here&#39;s the music for Yseult.</a></p>
<p>Now our next task is to ask where Grimoirh is.</p>
<p>I jump down the dock and pick up some Dream Herring from a crate, walk on the cliffside, and see my first Red herb of this game!</p>
<p>I jump down again at the city square...my god, the scenery looks so nice...</p>
<p>We turn back for more info. Grimoirh&#39;s not a familiar name in these parts. One local advises us to get some sun protection.</p>
<p>Daemonblight started spreading in the Southgand archipelago. Thanks to that, there&#39;s exorcists here too.</p>
<p>The Twelve Year Sickness is mentioned here too.</p>
<p>Heading down to the beach, there&#39;s a man fixing a boat...</p>
<p>I head under the boardwalk and rescue another Katz! He gives us <strong>Laughing Glasses</strong> as a reward!</p>
<p>The beach city here looks so vast...</p>
<p>Our expedition crew comes back with a new recipe: <strong>Wyvern Tendon Stew!</strong></p>
<p>A soldier doesn&#39;t know about Grimoirh, but mentions fishing bait.</p>
<p>The tavern keeper mentions northerners complaining about pengyon, but also brings up that they eat rappig.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a Bloodwing agent in the tavern as well.</p>
<p>The town&#39;s elder&#39;s sitting at a table, and asks us how we found Yseult so far. Velvet mentions it&#39;s different from Loegres. It&#39;s a very relaxed place way before the Opening, he says. The woman across him considers the Abbey her saviors.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Abbey, the wood industry&#39;s getting successful.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;In other words, when the money started flowing, people let it go to their heads?&quot;</p>
<p>The woman&#39;s in awe at the exorcists and northerners, and their &quot;sophistication.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Getting worked up and worked over by what&#39;s trendy. Isn&#39;t that [...] the very definition of youth?&quot;</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We climb two ladders up to the roof of the tavern...what a view!</p>
<p>We open the gold chest here and get <strong>Silky Paper!</strong></p>
<p>Climbing down and back out to the city, I open a silver chest in a hut and get a Poison Ward!</p>
<p>I go back to the man fixing the boat. He&#39;s proud of Southgand&#39;s wood. The wood comes from Natant trees, Laphicet says, which don&#39;t rot.</p>
<p>He tells us about the history between Southgand and Midgand. Midgand, awed at Southgand coming by a simple raft, went to Southgand, and &quot;the Age of Exploration&quot; began!</p>
<p>But things got worse: Midgand declared war on Southgand. I know where this is going, and I&#39;m right. Midgand won.</p>
<p><strong>Boat fixer:</strong> &quot;Our ancestors still liked to joke about it. They&#39;the say, &#39;Age of Exploration? More like Age of Exploitation!&#39;&quot;</p>
<p>He tells us Southgand people always found the good stuff in every bad situation.</p>
<p>Southgand&#39;s nickname is &quot;Shenanigand.&quot; Hee...</p>
<p>I head into the Sanctuary.</p>
<p>A man&#39;s brother died of the Twelve Year Sickness, a woman mentions the Empyreans again...and she lists the major four, and their respective elements. I&#39;m guessing Innominat is the light element...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We talk to the priest here. He must be a northerner...</p>
<p>He tells Rokurou to confess his sins this time. Ooooh boy...</p>
<p>He points out Rokurou&#39;s wardrobe as an indicator of the many sins he has.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Yeah, I hear you but I really can&#39;t think of anything.&quot;<br>
<strong>Priest:</strong> &quot;Have you wielded violence?&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;No, all I wield are my swords.&quot; Hee...<br>
<strong>Priest:</strong> &quot;Well, have you hurt anybody with your swords?&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Yeah, but I haven&#39;t been able to land a killing blow yet. I&#39;ve still got a long way to go.&quot; He&#39;s talking about Shigure.</p>
<p>The priest tells him to repent.</p>
<p>Rokurou thinks &quot;he needs to improve his cutting technique.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s a priest&#39;s job to guide the laymen, right? You&#39;ll have to start speaking more clearly if you want to anyone to trust your advice. Get your act together, man!&quot;</p>
<p>The priest decides to &quot;reflect&quot; on his sins. Then he does a double take...lol...poor priest...he&#39;s been had.</p>
<p>We head to the next area.</p>
<p>A peddler explains to a merchant the reason why Yseult&#39;s buildings are elevated. High tide, just like in real life.</p>
<p>The Abbey&#39;s influence is a bit looser in Southgand, but it is definitely there.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We make it to the town square. No leads on Grimoirh. Magilou got that letter either &quot;last year&quot; or &quot;a decade ago.&quot; Eizen threatens her with the sharks. She thinks a Kraken&#39;s better. Oh my god, Magilou...</p>
<p>Velvet is about to lose her temper on Magilou...</p>
<p>...and sees Oscar and Teresa!</p>
<p>They stop. Teresa mentions &quot;final preparations are complete&quot; to Oscar. Preparations for what? Oscar feels like he can&#39;t handle the job.</p>
<p><strong>Teresa:</strong> &quot;[The Shepherd] has high hopes for your deployment to Palamedes.&quot; <strong>Palamedes?</strong></p>
<p>Teresa gives Oscar words of encouragement &quot;to be himself&quot; and &quot;believe that he&#39;s a leader.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor doesn&#39;t even know the details about Palamedes either, thinking it&#39;s &quot;a facility on this island&quot;.</p>
<p>Teresa bids Oscar farewell.</p>
<p>Teresa then warns Oscar about a &quot;daemon in Haria.&quot;</p>
<p>She goes...then stops again to tell Oscar to boil the water in Southgand before drinking it. Oh my god! She cares about him a whole lot!</p>
<p>Rokurou calls the Haria daemon &quot;pretty feisty.&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou calls it &quot;magical&quot; that Oscar&#39;s in Yseult. Everyone&#39;s eyes are daggers on Eleanor...</p>
<p>Eleanor asks for proof before jumping to conclusions.</p>
<p>Velvet calls her &quot;sympathetic to the Abbey&#39;s cause.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor feels conflicted again...</p>
<p>Laphicet tells Magilou Eleanor hasn&#39;t tattled anyone. Magilou, you troll...</p>
<p>Velvet approaches her.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;You pledged to obey me until the day you died, correct?&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;...Yes. That I did.&quot;</p>
<p>They&#39;re almost at fists. Cooler heads prevail, with Laphicet mentioning the daemon might be after Grimoirh!</p>
<p>The crew leaves to find more info.</p>
<p>Eleanor breathes.</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Skit:</strong> Velvet asks Laphicet about the malak-and-vessel connection, probably trying to find any hint that Eleanor&#39;s spying on the crew for the Abbey.</p>
<p>Laphicet points out that he can&#39;t read Eleanor&#39;s mind.</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;Sitting in a box doesn&#39;t teach you how the box feels.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s thinking of keeping tabs on her. She asks Laphicet about Eleanor and his &quot;boundaries.&quot; They have a talk before bed. She sleeps soundly and softly.</p>
<p>Velvet warns Laphicet to watch out for &quot;the older girls&quot; in the party...</p>
<p>I play another new <strong>skit:</strong> Laphicet points out Teresa and Oscar&#39;s relationship as siblings. They&#39;ve never argued with each other. That&#39;s god-tier siblings right there.</p>
<p>Laphicet asks Velvet if she and her brother had fights. They did. But they cared for each other, and she called him &quot;adorable.&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet wonders if Rokurou&#39;s adorable since he&#39;s the youngest brother. Velvet&#39;s surprised by that answer. Laphicet says that Shigure mentions that &quot;he&#39;s so fun.&quot; I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the kind of &quot;adorable&quot; she was thinking of...</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s an only child.</p>
<p>Laphicet wants to play the role of Eleanor&#39;s brother. Velvet throws a death glare and tells him not to take the conversation seriously, and tells him &quot;malakhim are tools to exorcists.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor retorts that that&#39;s not true. Her outlook on malakhim&#39;s changed because she sees Laphicet as a little brother to her...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;She&#39;s all talk. Don&#39;t believe her.&quot; She&#39;s getting protective of him. Eleanor throws Velvet&#39;s previous remark back at her face.</p>
<p>Magilou adds more fuel to the fire.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Oooh! Two sisters struggling for the affections of their brother. Eeeny, teeny, candlestick! Which one will [Laphicet] pick?&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet prefers an older brother. Maybe he should be Rokurou&#39;s younger brother...</p>
<p><a name=6></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Another <strong>expedition check:</strong> We get a <strong>Crimson Crystal!</strong></p>
<p>Haria Village is overrun by daemons because of idolatry?</p>
<p>From a soldier, we learn Teresa was sent to Yseult because of her failure at Hellawes. Oscar&#39;s now taking over in her place.</p>
<p>Another Katz is on the beach with a new minigame: <strong>Bienfu Bounce!</strong></p>
<p>We find Himeko, another Character Card player, underneath a hut! We decide to play more!</p>
<p>After two games, I stop and head before the locked gate to Maclir Beach and explore.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a lot of pengyons hanging around the shallows...</p>
<p>We head back up to the deck...</p>
<p><a name=7></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Most of the Southganders, I learn from an elderly couple, were Amenoch worshippers. Amenoch&#39;s the Empyrean of Water, iirc.</p>
<p>Everyone in Southgand except one village is loyal to the Abbey. Haria Village...</p>
<p>The ex-Amenoch worshipper&#39;s &quot;grateful&quot; for the Abbey&#39;s work, but thinks they&#39;ve gone a bit too far by deciding which Empyrean should be worshipped.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;They think they do. It&#39;s their truth. Then again, they can&#39;t control what&#39;s in your heart, can they?&quot; Wise words, Rokurou.</p>
<p>The open tent weapon shop (anzrq nsgre Thl&#39;f erny fheanzr) has new <strong>Amphibole equipment</strong>. They also sell <strong>Dark Bottle</strong>s here, which attract enemies even in battle. Who would want those?</p>
<p>There&#39;s a young man sitting underneath the boardwalk on the struts, questioning the meaning &quot;of becoming an adult.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Heh! The eternal question of youth.&quot;</p>
<p>He asks us if we know about the Ceremony of Adulthood. Rokurou does, calling it a &quot;wild&quot; ceremony, but the traditions have changed. Instead of throwing poranges and bananuts, it&#39;s watermelon! And coconuts! Yikes!</p>
<p>He questions how one becomes an adult through that ceremony.</p>
<p>Eizen mentions there are traditional, danger-facing rites of passage in certain cultures to become an adult.</p>
<p>Velvet asks why not skip the ceremony.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Having the courage to say no to something you don&#39;t feel is right—isn&#39;t that the true mark of an adult?&quot; </p>
<p>What does it mean to &quot;be an adult&quot; at this point?</p>
<p>He jumps for joy at the suggestion! Hee...</p>
<p>Velvet brings him down to earth instantly.</p>
<p><a name=8></a></p>
<hr>
<p>It seems our expedition crew found <strong>Teepo Island!</strong></p>
<p>An Abbey worshipper&#39;s sad that Teresa&#39;s leaving Yseult. One&#39;s sighing in relief at her departure because of her personality.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;I guess not even the heat of Southgand could melt that icy cold personality.&quot;</p>
<p>But the worshipper vouches for Teresa, saying she&#39;s fair, and open-minded. She mentions the heated debate over whether the Abbey should go into Haria Village.</p>
<p>There&#39;s even a Teresa devotee in Southgand too...</p>
<p>One fisherman mentions Southgand food&#39;s getting popular: pengyons, poranges, bananuts...</p>
<p>Poranges, according to Eizen are &quot;also known as candlefruit.&quot;</p>
<p>The bountiful surplus of food in Southgand&#39;s so huge the fisherman&#39;s shipping it to other countries...</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;This guy here, he&#39;s a true sailor!&quot;</p>

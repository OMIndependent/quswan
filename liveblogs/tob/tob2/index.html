<p>Now another flashback, where Velvet wakes a young child called Laphi. He doesn&#39;t like being called Laphi. He has a bit of a fever, and because of that, he can&#39;t go to the cape.</p>
<p>There&#39;s Arthur, addressing the child by his full name: <strong>Laphicet</strong>. Is he the one she&#39;s seeking revenge against in the opening?</p>
<p>He&#39;s done with the firewood.</p>
<p>Velvet recites her teacher&#39;s lessons: &quot;<strong>Arthur&#39;s first maxim: Plans must be solid and reactions flexible.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;m now at <strong>Aball, the Village of Longing</strong>.</p>
<p>I&#39;m betting the developers were trying to block me from getting screenshots, probably to prevent me from either violating copyright rules or revealing any spoilers.</p>
<p>I&#39;m now in control of Velvet, and wander around the cabin, where I get a Silver Coin, and some rock salt...</p>
<p>I have Velvet talk to Laphicet again, who reminds us to take some gels, the trademark recovery item of the <strong>Tales</strong> games.</p>
<p>The game now goes through the basic pointers: the map and the objective HUD.</p>
<p>I&#39;m supposed to get medicine for Laphicet, and the first thing to do to get it is to hunt for Prickleboars in the <strong>Tranquil Woods</strong>.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I check Velvet&#39;s stats before getting a move on...</p>
<p>The menu&#39;s UI&#39;s a bit basic looking...</p>
<p>I also take a look at the Fashion menu, it mentions that Velvet&#39;s comb broke...</p>
<p>Two sub menus are unknown...</p>
<p>I read the synopsis, which mentions a crimson moon...and a daemonblight, along with many other in-universe terms. The backstory mentions that Velvet&#39;s sister was taken from her seven years ago, and now she&#39;s living with her brother Laphicet, and her mentor Arthur.</p>
<p>After looking at the artes and equipment (even Velvet has a gauntlet blade, sort of like the Assassins!), I head to the woods. The <strong>Blood Blade</strong>&#39;s feature is that Velvet can heal after defeating monsters!</p>
<p>I have Velvet look at a pair of graves. One of them must be her sister&#39;s...</p>
<p>I check the first skit of the game, Velvet&#39;s thinking of what to feed Arthur, who&#39;s been hunting for the village.</p>
<p>Now we&#39;re in Aball proper...</p>
<p>Seres? So Seres must be someone only Laphicet, Velvet, and Arthur can see...</p>
<p>The cutscene in the beginning must have showed that crimson moon disaster seven years ago.</p>
<p>So when they turn into daemons, or when they get affected with daemonblight, they&#39;re incurable at that point?</p>
<p>The shop owner indirectly insults the memory of Velvet&#39;s sister...his wife makes him apologize for that remark.</p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s friend&#39;s worried about him.</p>
<p>So Celica raised Velvet on her own before Arthur came along, huh?</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> (reciting one of Arthur&#39;s maxims) &quot;Battles are won and lost by the preparations made by the first strike.&quot;</p>
<p>I check the shop&#39;s wares: only <strong>Apple Gel</strong>s.</p>
<p>I open the first chest in-game, which has a <strong>Resist Ring!</strong></p>
<p>Each kind of chest, I&#39;m told, has its own type of item.</p>
<p>I talk to more people. Rumors are spreading that there are &quot;exorcists&quot; tricking villagers out of their money.</p>
<p>Beasts falling into daemonblight and becoming daemons themselves...</p>
<p>The elder thinks it&#39;s the Empyreans cursing the people with daemonblight for not praying enough.</p>
<p>She warns Velvet not to go to the Shrine of Tranquility, or the shrine near the cape.</p>
<p>They try to help each other and they tell each other they&#39;re not children as a response...hee...</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s sixteen, the elder thinks she&#39;s thirteen.</p>
<p><strong>Elder:</strong> &quot;The shrine on the cape has no name. It is a silent shrine of tranquility. Something nameless sleeps there. Daemons and Empyreans slumber within. Into the deepest depths. In perfect silence. Sleep. Fade.&quot;</p>
<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> The term Empyrean, iirc, was used in Dante&#39;s <strong>Divine Comedy</strong>, in the part where Dante goes to Heaven where he meets Beatrice.</p>
<p><strong>Scarlet Night</strong>, I also learn, was the night when the red moon appeared...gur erq zbba erzvaqf zr fb zhpu bs <strong>Oerngu bs gur Jvyq</strong>. Ohg guvf tnzr jnf eryrnfrq gjb zbaguf orsber gung bar, V guvax?</p>
<p>And I find my first save point in the game! </p>

<hr>
<p>I also have Velvet talk to a young mother, who teases Velvet a bit about her future, and a chief carpenter, who&#39;s aware of the people living in <strong>Morgana Woods</strong> are afflicted with daemonblight. The younger carpenter thinks the walls aren&#39;t strong enough to prevent a daemon attack... <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>There&#39;s rappigs in this game too! Yesssss!</p>
<p>They&#39;re the only hybrid animal that the <strong>Avatar</strong> crew did not mention or include...I wonder why...</p>
<p>I speak to the owner again, he prefers a quick and painless death.</p>
<p>I save at this point again, since my phone&#39;s running out of battery.</p>
<p>Whoo, that was a lot of stuff to write in this session!</p>

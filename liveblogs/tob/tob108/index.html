<p>Fberl jbhyq unir n svryq qnl jura ur frrf gurfr ehvaf...</p>
<p>Noticing a barrier from afar, I jump to the ruins, also seeing a switch to turn it off.</p>
<p>The new enemies here are a <strong>Red Mist Watcher</strong>, a <strong>Faerie Bounty</strong>, and <strong>Scatterer</strong>s!</p>
<p>The area around here&#39;s winding...</p>
<p>It seems there&#39;s a green barrier here as well...now to find the switch to lower that, since that&#39;s where the next area is...</p>
<p>I have Rokurou kick out the boulder in the way and see the green crystal switch from afar.</p>
<p>A new Treant cousin monster called the <strong>Hallowed Tree</strong>&#39;s also here!</p>
<p>I change the crystal switch from green to yellow and proceed.</p>
<p>Into the next area, where a yellow barrier&#39;s blocking one side of the landmass, but the west part is barrier free...</p>
<p>Another <strong>skit:</strong> Teresa&#39;s still thinking about Phi&#39;s power that made him break free at the Empyreans Throne. She also mentions the other malak having that same power...</p>
<p>Phi&#39;s still scared of her...poor Phi...</p>
<p>Teresa points out her anger came from her carelessness, and still thinks of Phi as a tool...she&#39;s more concerned about Oscar.</p>
<p>Velvet steps in.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;I&#39;m the one that hurt your precious brother. And you&#39;re still asking for my help now?&quot;</p>
<p>Teresa points out all the things Velvet did to Oscar way back in Titania.</p>
<p><strong>Teresa:</strong> &quot;With no malakhim, I&#39;m an ordinary woman. How could I threaten the Lord of Calamity?&quot; Seems like Velvet&#39;s moniker is catching on.</p>
<p>Phi tries to mention Velvet&#39;s younger brother to her (probably as a way to slowly tell Teresa the truth about the Shepherd?). She doesn&#39;t care, save for Oscar.</p>
<p><strong>Teresa:</strong> &quot;As powerless as I am now, this is the only path for me.&quot;</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Checking the map, Oscar&#39;s way to the northwest of the marsh...</p>
<p>After collecting more spirits and treasures, I leap over the ruins west...</p>
<p>There&#39;s lots of ruins to leap over...</p>
<p>And it seems we&#39;re already close to where Oscar and the therion is...</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the way further is blocked by a cracked brick wall...</p>
<p>I leap back and switch the crystal from yellow to green this time.</p>
<p>Now in the third area of the marsh, where I circle around the green barrier, and break the boulder there...</p>
<p>Further north, Laphicet&#39;s still very sad...Eleanor asks him what&#39;s wrong. Magilou also comes in, getting to the heart of his matter in her own way.</p>
<p>Magilou considers herself as the &quot;kindest&quot; older sister. In her dreams...</p>
<p>Bienfu agrees with me.</p>
<p>Laphicet wants to stand up to her. And Teresa still calls him by a number. Be quiet, Teresa.</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s just it. <strong>I&#39;m not Number Two. I&#39;m...I&#39;m Laphicet.</strong>&quot; Yes! <strong>Yes!!!</strong></p>
<p>Teresa is still wrapping her head around the idea of malakhim as people.</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> (smiles) &quot;Yes, I have feelings. You see...malakhim are not tools.&quot;<br>
<strong>Teresa:</strong> &quot;Very well. I shall call you Laphicet from now on.&quot; That sounded...too easy.</p>
<p>Magilou and Eleanor thank her. I am not too fond of Teresa giving in so easily like this.</p>
<p><strong>Teresa:</strong> &quot;You misunderstand. With so much at stake, I dont want to rock the boat.&quot; *smh*...she&#39;s just playing along just so she can get to Oscar.</p>
<p><strong>Skit:</strong> Eizen asks Velvet what she knows about Oscar and Teresa.</p>
<p>Then Bienfu steps in. He calls that duo &quot;the best of the best&quot; praetors out of a 100. Eleanor explains further about what a consul does. In short, consuls lead in combat and in city management.</p>
<p>So Eleanor&#39;s full rank is an exorcist praetor primus. She mentions that she can&#39;t overcome Teresa or Oscar.</p>
<p>From Bienfu, those two &quot;wiped out dozens of daemons in a single night.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Bienfu:</strong> &quot;After that, Lord Melchior kept a close eye on them.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet and Eizen are relieved, but Bienfu warns us about Oscar&#39;s new powers.</p>
<p>Rokurou, Velvet, and Eleanor are getting suspicious on where Bienfu&#39;s getting his info...</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Why don&#39;t you call him &#39;Lord Oscar&#39;?&quot;</p>
<p>Bienfu sees Oscar as a &quot;rival&quot; in looks.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>There&#39;s a crystal switch ahead, along with a wide gap that&#39;s geoboard-crossable.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we haven&#39;t activated the geotree in the marsh yet...</p>
<p>This marsh is so complex...</p>
<p>I deactivate the red barrier via the crystal switch here, and jump to the ruins north. There&#39;s a Katz Box at the end of the route.</p>
<p>I switch the crystal from red to blue and head eastward, avoiding more enemies.</p>
<p>The crew&#39;s still walking...</p>
<p>Phi notices something! It&#39;s another beetle climbing on the tree!</p>
<p>Phi tries to climb the tree, but he can&#39;t reach it...</p>
<p>Teresa comes closer to the tree. Phi mentions it&#39;s a &quot;Lionel giant thunderstag.&quot; Teresa asks about the &quot;awkward&quot; naming of the beetles.</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;I...I think...it&#39;s a cool name...&quot;</p>
<p>Teresa, a bit exhausted, goes to pick up the beetle for him. He&#39;s surprised by her gesture, and he takes it. He thanks her.</p>
<p>Teresa mentions more backstory about Oscar.</p>
<p><strong>Teresa:</strong> &quot;When he was little, Oscar was always running around the woods collecting bugs. He&#39;d get so into it, it was never long before he&#39;d trip and hurt himself.&quot;</p>
<p>So Teresa picked up bugs for Oscar too.</p>
<p><strong>Teresa:</strong> (smiles) &quot;Once he gave me a whole pile of cicada shells as his way of thanking me. I just screamed.&quot;<br>
<strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;I&#39;m sure he just wanted to let you know how he felt.&quot; If I were her, I&#39;d be the same way.</p>
<p>Teresa&#39;s eyes widen. Phi looks a bit frightened.</p>
<p>And she goes back to condescending Phi, calling it &quot;unusual&quot; for malakhim to relate to other people. Boo!</p>
<p>She touches her earring.</p>
<p><strong>Teresa:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s hard for people too...Sometimes it feels insurmountable, and yet we can&#39;t give up...Sometimes you just have to say what you believe in your heart, even if you&#39;re not good at saying it.&quot; This is so surprising, seeing a contemplative Teresa...</p>
<p>Velvet asks Phi about his and Teresa&#39;s conversation.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We head further east and north, breaking another boulder in the way.</p>
<p>I switch the crystal at the edge of the area from red to blue.</p>
<p>Rokurou asks Phi about the new Lionel thunderstag he found. Rokurou and Eizen are fascinated by the beetle&#39;s pincers...and here they go again with another species dispute. Phi declares if they fight again over the species, he&#39;ll declare this to be a drone beetle.</p>
<p>Teresa asks Eleanor if she fed words into Phi. No!</p>
<p><strong>Teresa:</strong> &quot;A malak...acting so human...&quot;</p>
<p>Even Eleanor thought that malakhim had no free will of their own, thinking theidea as &quot;inconceivable&quot; at first. Then she met Phi and Eizen, and character development happened.</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s now more welcoming of other species in this game. Character development yay!</p>
<p>Teresa is trying to process all of what Eleanor&#39;s explained to her about daemons, therions, and malakhim having free will.</p>
<p>Eleanor mentions Teresa&#39;s childhood with Oscar when seeing Phi. She stops the conversation immediately.</p>
<p>Next area now...</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Teresa, be honest. Isn&#39;t there somthing wrong with the Abbey using a dangerous experimental arte out in the field?&quot;<br>
<strong>Teresa:</strong> &quot;...Oscar&#39;s the one who decided to go through with it. Don&#39;t presume to know anything about who he is.&quot;</p>
<p>I turn the nearby crystal switch here from red to blue.</p>
<p>No turning back now...</p>
<p>I also notice there&#39;s a geotree and a code red daemon in this area.</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Teresa&#39;s concern for Oscar grows even more. Phi asks her what&#39;s wrong. He tells her &quot;she&#39;s too hard on herself.&quot; She&#39;s well aware of that.</p>
<p>So Teresa knew Phi went off to read by himself, didn&#39;t he? But she didn&#39;t stop him...she asks Phi how he&#39;s different from her (formerly) other malak. She let him go do his adventuring around Northgand?</p>
<p>But she was going to &quot;punish&quot; him if he snuck off more... <img class=emojione alt=☹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>She smiles so calmly at him. Poor Phi...</p>
<p>She laughs cheerfully.</p>
<p>Magilou, Velvet, and Eizen look on.</p>
<p>Eizen knows Teresa might be lying by omission. Velvet will immediately waste no time if Teresa does something &quot;funny.&quot;</p>
<p>The area where the code red&#39;s located is blocked by a red barrier.</p>
<p>Turning south and forward, I see the crystal switch to lower that barrier...</p>
<p>I skip it for now, and move ahead, activating the geotree, and lowering the green barrier through another nearby crystal switch.</p>
<p>Now we&#39;ve made it around full circle.</p>
<p>Heading north, we&#39;re finally back at the last area before meeting with Oscar...</p>
<p>Velvet and Teresa talk about their plan to capture Oscar and the therion.</p>
<p>Velvet decides to let them go if Oscar complies. The plan sounds very simple, but I know Oscar won&#39;t go down without a fight...</p>
<p>Teresa tells Velvet not to harm Oscar, but as Velvet says, it all &quot;depends on him.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor and Phi also want Velvet not to hurt Oscar either.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;You&#39;re his sister. Do whatever you have to to protect him.&quot;<br>
<strong>Teresa:</strong> &quot;I will. <strong>Even if it means my death.</strong>&quot;</p>

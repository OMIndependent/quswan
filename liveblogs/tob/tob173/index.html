<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> For context, I wrote this and the later parts of this playthrough in August.</p>
<p>Breathing deeply.</p>
<p>After a month of putting this off, and eight months of playing through this game, it&#39;s time for the final bosses...</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;I can feel him...Innominat is just up ahead.&quot;</p>
<p>We&#39;re now before a set of tall, sloping stairs...yikes, those stairs look extravagant...</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Finally, time to repay my debt.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;...you just like saying that, don&#39;t you?&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Auggh! You saw right through me!&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Oh, come on, it wasn&#39;t hard. Nobody here is going to do anything for anyone but themselves.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;I can&#39;t deny that.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Your wheel is yours alone to hold.&quot;<br>
<strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;That...is our creed!&quot;</p>
<p>My god, it&#39;s a long way down from here too...</p>
<p>Through the transparent glass floor, we see Innominat and the Shepherd. They&#39;ve been waiting for us for who knows how long...</p>
<p>I have Velvet slowly walk up the last steps.</p>
<p>Breathing deeply again. This is the end.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s theme plays.</p>
<p>The entire crew walk toward them.</p>
<p>Magilou delivers the first line.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Sorry to keep you waiting, Gentle Shepherd! The Lord of Calamity and friends are here to see you!&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;I can&#39;t wait to strike down the world&#39;s greatest swordsman.&quot;<br>
<strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;You picked a fight with the Aifread crew! Now we&#39;re here to finish it!&quot;</p>
<p>There&#39;s the Shepherd with his long white-gold sword...</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;...I follow my own will now. And I&#39;m going to stop you!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;...In my sword lie the hopes of mankind. The potential for a perfect world.&quot; Liar.</p>
<p>With a strike of his sheathed sword, he exudes waves of power!</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;Do you really believe that Will without Reason can break it?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;Your sword is strong. But...it&#39;s only a weapon. Just like ours!&quot;</p>
<p>Here we go!</p>
<p>Innominat stares deeply at Laphicet, then he touches his cheek, the place where Laphicet punched him.</p>
<p><strong>Innominat:</strong> &quot;Ever since you hit me, I&#39;ve had this [...] feeling in my chest. But I can&#39;t figure out what it is.&quot; Revenge, of course.</p>
<p>Laphicet swears to hit him again! Owch! Them&#39;s fighting words...</p>
<p><strong>Innominat:</strong> &quot;I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll feel better after I eat you.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<p>Now it&#39;s Velvet&#39;s turn.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;...Arthur. I finally have an answer to your question. <strong>&#39;Why do you think that birds fly?&#39;</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>A long pause.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>Birds fly because they want to fly. They don&#39;t need a reason. Even if their wings may snap and doom them to die. They don&#39;t fly for anyone&#39;s benefit. They don&#39;t fly because they were ordered to.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>She steps forward.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>Birds fly because they want to fly, and for no other reason!</strong>&quot;<br>
<strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;...So that&#39;s your answer.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Yes. Because that&#39;s who I am.&quot;</p>
<p>The Shepherd responds.</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;...You were always like this. That sort of foolishness is what creates the daemons, and plunges the world into tragedy and despair.&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> (angry) &quot;Then you drive the daemons out! Isn&#39;t that right, Shepherd Artorius!?&quot;<br>
<strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;That has been my plan all along.&quot;</p>
<p>The Shepherd unsheathes his sword, and he and Innominat dash away!</p>
<p>The fight begins!</p>
<p>Six-on-two...with Velvet and Rokurou teaming up to fight the Shepherd, and Laphicet with Innominat. Eleanor joins in, as Eizen and Magilou unleash magic on him! That misses...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;If you want to kill us, you&#39;d better finish the job! Because if you don&#39;t...&quot;</p>
<p>She kicks the Shepherd at his wounded arm!</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;<strong>...I&#39;m going to devour you!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>The fight continues!</p>
<hr>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<p>Now the real fight begins.</p>
<p>I check our final bosses&#39; stats...</p>
<p>One&#39;s weak to fire, the other to earth...</p>
<p>I rearrange Velvet&#39;s artes first...</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;I shall sever all our ties!&quot;<br>
<strong>Innominat:</strong> &quot;You&#39;ll pay for what you did to me!&quot;</p>
<p>The Shepherd unleashes his Mystic Arte on Eleanor: <strong><em>Savage Wolf Fury!</em></strong> Bu zl tbq, gung&#39;f qrsvavgryl Lhev&#39;f ZN ur&#39;f hfvat!!! V pna&#39;g oryvrir vg!!!</p>
<p>The battle continues!</p>
<p>I take on the Shepherd first!</p>
<p>After reviving Eleanor, she assists with taking down the Shepherd!</p>
<p>Now it&#39;s Innominat&#39;s turn for his Mystic Arte: a <strong>Primal Kill!</strong></p>
<p>A few minutes later and another Mystic Arte strike from Innominat, I target Innominat next.</p>
<p>Now that Innominat&#39;s health is getting lower, he&#39;s resorting to more powerful artes this time like Crown Fire and Meteor Storm!</p>
<p>We&#39;re almost finished here...</p>
<p>I use up an Elixir.</p>
<p>I decide to use all of Velvet&#39;s therion powers on Innominat at this point.</p>
<p>Innominat is finished!</p>
<p>The lineup is now Magilou, Rokurou, and Velvet, with Eleanor KO&#39;d!</p>
<p>Rokurou deals the final blow to the Shepherd!</p>
<hr>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;Tenacious, you daemons.&quot;</p>
<p>Everyone&#39;s energy is spent...</p>
<p>The Shepherd and Innominat have another trick up their sleeve...</p>
<p>Innominat sees Laphicet healing Velvet and strikes at him!</p>
<p>Velvet gets between him and Laphicet and the fight continues!</p>
<p>Innominat&#39;s about to strike! Velvet&#39;s eyes widen...</p>
<p>She shows the comb!</p>
<p>Innominat breaks it!</p>
<p>It&#39;s a callback to Innominat breaking Laphicet&#39;s compass!</p>
<p>With Velvet literally striking this game&#39;s equivalent of God!</p>
<p><strong>Innominat:</strong> &quot;Why...do you have my comb?&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;That was...the comb Laphi gave me. Not you, Innominat.&quot;<br>
<strong>Innominat:</strong> (shaken?) &quot;Of course... I&#39;m Innominat, now reborn, and you&#39;re the Lord of Calamity. Aaah...Artorius, I&#39;m hungry.&quot;</p>
<p>Innominat&#39;s pupils darken. He&#39;s feeling pain from hunger.</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;It looks like we won&#39;t be able to harvest &#39;despair&#39; by eating you [Velvet?] anymore.&quot; Oh no...</p>
<p>Now the Shepherd gets behind Innominat. They&#39;re going to fuse...</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> (closes his eyes) &quot;<strong>Birds must fly, because they possess strong wings. Mankind must be suppressed, because it possesses great sin. Malevolence, tragedy, war, anger, tears, even love must all be suppressed.</strong>&quot; My god, this man...</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;<strong>With the grace of my beating wings, I will grant humanity the tranquility it deserves.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>He&#39;s falling to malevolence...even the Shepherd&#39;s not immune.</p>
<p>The Shepherd commands Innominat to eat his &quot;despair&quot; away.</p>
<p>Innominat bites his neck...</p>
<p>Oh my god!</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;<strong><em>Nevn Huw Eijam!</em></strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Innominat&#39;s fully restored.</p>
<p>What the heck!?</p>
<p>He fused with Innominat! Vzb, gur Furcureq ybbxf n ovg yvxr Lttqenfvyy zrrgf Lhev va uvf svany sbez va juvgr-tbyq nezbe. His right arm&#39;s glowing golden, and wielding a large, radiant sword.</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> &quot;Now! <strong>With the full might of my [fusion]...</strong> <strong><em>I shall suppress all creation!</em></strong>&quot;</p>

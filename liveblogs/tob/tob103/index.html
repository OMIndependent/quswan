<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/oByyklbPuiw>The sad music plays here again</a>.</p>
<p>I check the graves of the Shepherd and Celica&#39;s son: &quot;<strong>This little life will spread its wings and soar through the skies.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Could this epitaph hint at an answer to the Shepherd&#39;s question that he asked Velvet and Eleanor? It also implies his words about Seres being &quot;a mother bird.&quot; She spread her wings and flew...</p>
<p>The shelf&#39;s empty.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;No surprise there. The Shepherd is too thorough to overlook something like that.&quot;</p>
<p>Phi&#39;s having regrets again. Velvet tells him not to worry.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;It was just a dream. All of it.&quot;</p>
<p>I see some rolls of yarn in Velvet&#39;s room. She was learning how to knit...Niko would&#39;ve taught her knitting in exchange for Velvet&#39;s quiche recipe.</p>
<p>Rokurou notices Laphi&#39;s library. Phi sees Laphi&#39;s unfinished world map. He compliments its beauty. Eizen, for its detail.</p>
<p>Velvet mentions how her brother would &quot;stare at that map for hours&quot; if he got too sick...</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;Laphicet, he...wanted to travel the world?&quot;<br>
<strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Yes. It was his dream. I never understood what made him want to do something so dangerous.&quot; She&#39;s now living his dream. She knows that, calling it &quot;ironic.&quot;</p>
<p>Now to the gravestone of sister Celica and Velvet&#39;s unborn nephew...oh my god...</p>
<p>Phi thinks they should leave some flowers. Velvet don&#39;t care.</p>
<p><strong>Melchior:</strong> &quot;<strong>A keen insight. Eating one would be cruel enough, but plucking an innocent flower just to offer it as decoration for some memorial...That&#39;s not even a sacrifice. Just a cruelty devoid of all purpose.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou mutters under her breath. She <strong>does</strong> know this guy.</p>
<p>Velvet asks if he&#39;s the one doing all the illusions. <strong>He is.</strong> He tells her &quot;she did well to break free.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Melchior:</strong> &quot;If you weren&#39;t a therion, I&#39;d be tempted to take you under my wing...&quot;</p>
<p>Melchior has the original copy of Innominat&#39;s tome! Oh my god! So it was real, but we were a bit too late...</p>
<p><strong>Melchior:</strong> &quot;This [...] was complied by my dear friend who was also the Shepherd&#39;s mentor, and predecessor as head of the exorcists.&quot; <strong>Claudin!?</strong> How long did he live?!</p>
<p><strong>Melchior:</strong> &quot;It contains the hopes and dreams left by a noble soul who gave his life for the world that grieved him.&quot; He refuses, in his elegant way, to give Velvet the book.</p>
<p>Eizen and Velvet charge at him!</p>
<p>Oh my god! He transformed! No, it&#39;s another daemon that&#39;s guarding him!</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Is that... <strong>you didn&#39;t!</strong>&quot; It&#39;s Aifread as a therion! Oh my god!</p>
<p><strong>Melchior:</strong> &quot;What we seek is the realization of a perfect order, as tranquil and beautiful as a wildflower in bloom.&quot;</p>
<p>They warp away.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Eleanor didn&#39;t get what Melchior meant by his &quot;perfect order&quot; line.</p>
<p>They want to destroy the world and create it anew, I&#39;m thinking...</p>
<p>Phi sees a book from the empty general store booth...</p>
<p>Velvet gets a flashback...from the beginning of the game. It&#39;s Laphi&#39;s copy of Innominat&#39;s tome!</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;He transcribed it by hand and then he sold it. Just to buy me that comb.&quot;</p>
<p>Phi hands her the tome. She closes her eyes...</p>
<p>I hope it&#39;s a complete copy...</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Pulling one over the old man are you? Never a dull moment with Lady Calamity around.&quot;</p>
<p>Thank you, Laphi! I did not see that coming!</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Alright, time to drop off the pups and get Grim to translate this book.&quot;</p>
<p>I do some level grinding...</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;That horned monster...&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;He was with Melchior. There was something different about him.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou asks Eizen if the daemon&#39;s a malak. I don&#39;t think so.</p>
<p>Phi asks why the Abbey&#39;s colluding with daemons, or maybe they have therions...Eleanor thinks the same thing I am too, the bodyguard&#39;s probably a therion.</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s not too sure.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;In any case, now we know Melchior has a mean-looking bodyguard in addition to his illusions. It&#39;ll take quite a lot to stop him.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s Aifread turned into a daemon...poor Aifread...</p>
<p>Across the way in Lake Perinya, Eizen asks Eleanor if she&#39;s a spy.</p>
<p>Phi sticks up for her.</p>
<p>Eizen then asks why Melchior had an illusion waiting for them in the village.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;I&#39;m not up to any tricks. It&#39;s far too late for that now.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou assumes Magilou&#39;s the spy. I think so too...she denies &quot;[knowing] what a trick is.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet thinks if Eleanor was a spy, then the hideout would have been surrounded by the Abbey at this moment.</p>
<p>Eizen mentions one question: <strong>Why was Melchior waiting for them in the village?</strong> </p>
<p>Velvet knows that the Abbey knows of the crew&#39;s plans. Eleanor&#39;s not off the hook just yet.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Oho, such a brave determined soul!&quot;</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Next <strong>skit:</strong> Eizen asks Eleanor about an &quot;arte that can control daemons.&quot; She doesn&#39;t know most of the Abbey&#39;s secrets. Plus, why revive Innominat for when they can do that? World domination?</p>
<p>Rokurou mentions the daemon Melchior has.</p>
<p>Magilou knocks down all of the possibilities here, assuming manipulation.</p>
<p>Melchior&#39;s on par with Dumbledore on that.</p>
<p><strong>Phi:</strong> &quot;If you can create an illusion of something someone really wants, you can control them.&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou&#39;s acting very serious here. She probably knows some of Melchior&#39;s tricks.</p>
<p>Then she gets back to mentioning &quot;eeny teeny spiny crow...&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen&#39;s raising eyebrows about Magilou&#39;s sudden knowledge of suggestion. So&#39;s Eleanor.</p>
<p>Another <strong>skit</strong> before we go back to Taliesin: Phi denies Eleanor being a spy, and sticks up for her, saying that&#39;s he&#39;s watched her, along with Velvet.</p>
<p>Rokurou understands, knowing the guilt would be too much for her, and that she would turn into a daemon just from the guilt alone.</p>
<p>Phi&#39;s happy he hasn&#39;t become a dragon...</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;<strong>Thank you, both of you.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen, however, says they have to be more careful, since people like Melchior might be &quot;recording her thoughts.&quot;</p>
<p>That&#39;s close. And Magilou jumps in!</p>
<p>Rokurou, smiling, asks why Magilou told them off to Teresa. Magilou realizes that just now.</p>
<p>Rokurou smiles, confirming that Magilou&#39;s not spying on the party. Phi laughs. So does Eleanor.</p>
<p>Magilou, if you weren&#39;t such a troll...</p>

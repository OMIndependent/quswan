<p>I play a <strong>skit: A Virtuous Spy</strong>.</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s looking around, sweating...</p>
<p>...and ponders about Velvet&#39;s left arm. A &quot;mysterious weapon,&quot; she calls it, and sees it as a threat to the Abbey.</p>
<p>She talks about what she knows about the daemon arm. Meanwhile, Rokurou&#39;s walking by...</p>
<p>Eleanor notices the bandages covering up the arm aren&#39;t torn up...</p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s looking at her suspiciously...</p>
<p>Everyone&#39;s suspicious of her. Eleanor examines Velvet&#39;s wardrobe next...she probably wears it as memorabilia...</p>
<p>Eleanor thinks she should sew her clothes...lol...</p>
<p>But she&#39;s afraid the Shepherd would &quot;scold&quot; her for being &quot;fired up.&quot; Velvet comes to her, and Eleanor talks about fixing her clothes...Velvet&#39;s okay with that.</p>
<p>She notices Eleanor&#39;s sweating, and tells her &quot;to take care of herself&quot; if the weather changes...</p>
<p>Velvet tells Eleanor she&#39;ll catch a cold if she keeps sweating like that.</p>
<p>Velvet does care for Eleanor&#39;s hygiene and well-being. Eleanor&#39;s surprised at hearing such advice from her...</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;We girls have to be considerate of each other...&quot;</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I save and talk to the nearby Bloodwing agent who rewards us for our code red hunts.</p>
<p>The bandit that we met in the ravine asks us where the Swordbreaker is...</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;He&#39;s been dealt with.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor asks him what he&#39;s doing in the port. He changed his ways, and is heading to Loegres to start a restaurant for &quot;bandit cuisine.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor hopes he does well, and &quot;roots for [him]!&quot;</p>
<p>One housewife&#39;s grateful that Shigure came along and stopped the Swordbreaker.</p>
<p>More people talk joyously about Legate Shigure, saying that the only injury he suffered was from his cat scratching him.</p>
<p>The local swordsmith calls Rokurou&#39;s Stormhowl &quot;impressive.&quot; The swordsmith&#39;s a twenty-year &quot;novice.&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s even shocked!</p>
<p>Rokurou says that a lot of swordsmiths have given up, saying swords aren&#39;t working anymore against daemons...unless an exorcist uses them.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Abbey, Cadnix Isle&#39;s weapon trade is prospering.</p>
<p>Checking the map, Islegand&#39;s southwest of Westgand...</p>
<p>The port&#39;s a shadow of its former self but its weapons are the best when it comes to quality...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>In the inn, they&#39;re talking about the legend of the Swordbreaker...</p>
<p>We rest at the inn, where Rokurou&#39;s training super-hard, shirtless...</p>
<p>Velvet asks him why not train with two swords. He&#39;s always been training with one sword. &quot;10,000 practice swings a day&quot; since he was very young. He wants the perfect strike at his brother.</p>
<p>My goodness, he probably even trained that way in Titania too.</p>
<p>He&#39;s now deciding to do <strong>100,000</strong> a day!</p>
<p>Velvet tells him the mathematical impossibility of that. Rokurou&#39;ll only manage 86,400 swings a day at most if he does one swing a second. (I calculated that!) He then decides to do ten swings a second!</p>
<p>Velvet thinks that&#39;s going nowhere.</p>
<p>Rokurou points out that he&#39;s &quot;defeating an undefeatable adversary.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;All I can do is recognize the fact, and give it my best shot.&quot;</p>
<p>Now he&#39;s getting tired...</p>
<p>Velvet tells him to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;A lack of sleep will get you killed faster than a lack of practice.&quot; Good point.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Near where the <em>Van Eltia</em>&#39;s docked, there&#39;s another Katz!</p>
<p>After a few rounds of minigames, where I get more fashion prizes, I save and head down to the docks!</p>
<p>One of the pirates are in shock that Eizen and crew are in Islegand. Rumors have spread from the Bloodwings that the Abbey took care of them!</p>
<p>The pirate&#39;s not too comfortable with an exorcist aboard the <em>Van Eltia</em>. Eizen assures him he&#39;s got his eye on her.</p>
<p>Captain Aifread, on the other hand, would be excited having an exorcist aboard his ship, if he was on the ship...</p>
<p>Time to set sail!</p>
<p>Benwick thinks it&#39;s Eizen&#39;s Curse that got the party in Islegand.</p>
<p>Now we can sail to different continents! Yes!</p>
<p>Our only choices so far are <strong>Islegand</strong> and <strong>Southgand</strong>.</p>
<p>To Southgand we go!</p>
<p>On our way there, Kurogane and Dyle are talking to each other. Magilou&#39;s up and about. Eleanor and Velvet are looking at the sea on opposite sides of the ship.</p>
<p>Rokurou heads over to Dyle.</p>
<p>Benwick thinks that Velvet&#39;s ragtag crew is &quot;more of a circus troupe.&quot; Benwick&#39;s fine with daemons aboard.</p>
<p><strong>Benwick:</strong> &quot;If you&#39;re aboard this ship of misfits, you&#39;re a pirate! That&#39;s just our creed. At least that&#39;s what the captain and first mate always say.&quot;</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Laphicet asks Benwick what Aifread&#39;s like.</p>
<p>He compares his captain to being a &quot;pointed beard&quot; of the sea.</p>
<p>Benwick adds that everyone aboard the ship is &quot;an outcast in some way.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Benwick:</strong> &quot;Despite that, Captain Aifread accepted us for who we are and took us all on board.&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet considers him &quot;kind&quot; for doing so. I think he has to be more open-minded, since the sea isn&#39;t.</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> (about Aifread) &quot;Sounds like he&#39;s a little scary and hard to read...&quot; Just like the sea.</p>
<p>In short, from Benwick&#39;s description of him, Van Aifread <strong>is</strong> the sea.</p>
<p>Laphicet compares his personality to Velvet.</p>
<p>Eizen comes up to deck and says to change course for <strong>Port Reneed</strong>. <strong>What?</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, three crewmembers died from &quot;corsair&#39;s scourge.&quot; Oh no...</p>
<p>Everyone is carrying &quot;corsair&#39;s scourge...&quot; All they can do now is drink more fresh water...</p>
<p>Magilou explains the symptoms, and starts another tall tale about where the disease came from.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Only humans fall prey to the corsair&#39;s scourge.&quot;</p>
<p>So Magilou may have it. She overdramatically narrates her end. Oh, Magilou...</p>
<p>Eleanor might have been infected too. Magilou asks why no one&#39;s worried about Magilou.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> (to Magilou) &quot;You&#39;re a witch. Magic yourself healthy.&quot; Jeez, Velvet, hee...</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s curious to know what the &quot;Reaper&#39;s Curse&quot; is...</p>
<p>We head for rainy <strong>Port Reneed</strong> in south <strong>Westgand</strong>...</p>

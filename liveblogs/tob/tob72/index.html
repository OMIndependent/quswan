<p>I talk to a pirate who saved someone leaving a Class 4 island. She was hunting a &quot;rare wolf&quot; there. But the place was empty. It turns out there&#39;s something dangerous there. She tried to escape, but her ship and supplies got ravaged up badly!</p>
<p>Exorcists were also killed on that island!</p>
<p>She warns us to be very prepared before going there.</p>
<p>Benwick tells us we have some news from Tabatha, who has another job for us to do.</p>
<p>Velvet accepts the job, because she wants to see the griffin therion again!</p>
<p>Eizen agrees, thinking that the Bloodwings might have knowledge on the other therions.</p>
<p>Our only choice is to head to Port Zekson...</p>
<p>Inside the <em>Van Eltia</em>&#39;s saloon, Laphicet and Kamoana talk...and Eleanor pulls out her mother&#39;s mirror...</p>
<p>Kamoana sees the &quot;pretty&quot; mirror, and Eleanor explains what it is. She offers it to Kamoana, who sees her reflection...and cries in fright!</p>
<p>Oh no, the malevolence from her is kicking up again!</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> (thinking) &quot;When I was her age...that&#39;s just how I cried...&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor disrobes and shows Kamoana her scars...</p>
<p>She asks Kamoana if she&#39;s &quot;scary.&quot; No.</p>
<p>Kamoana then asks her if she&#39;s scary. No. Eleanor reassures her that she isn&#39;t.</p>
<p>Eleanor got the scar when she got attacked by a daemon. But her mother shielded her! <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png> The feels...</p>
<p>Her mother&#39;s last words to Eleanor: &quot;<strong>Stay strong and keep living.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet interrupts! Grim has an update on the translation!</p>
<p>Velvet notices Laphicet&#39;s blushing...oh, Laphicet...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Grimoirh asks us about the second verse of the song. Laphicet recites it.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;We think that passage means that Innominat and the therions will be revived by a chosen one, right?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Grimoirh:</strong> &quot;The song means that Innominat chooses who becomes therions?&quot;</p>
<p>Grim recites the last part of the second verse again.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;...that someone receptive to Innominat&#39;s power will be reborn as a therion.&quot; Oh god!</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Which is to say that the Abbey figured out how to turn people into therions and then got right to work.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s in shock at the twists and turns of the story so far!</p>
<p>Velvet assumes the Shepherd may be a therion too.</p>
<p>Grimoirh recites the &quot;forever reborn&quot; quote again, implying therions might be reincarnated or something...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Even if you kill one, there are more waiting in line. They can&#39;t be wiped out.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s still considering Kamoana for execution... <del>please no</del></p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;But therions can&#39;t be killed. Not truly.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;So...if you kill one, another person who&#39;s receptive to Innominat&#39;s power will be reborn as one.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;If you <strong>don&#39;t</strong> kill them, the next ones won&#39;t be born.&quot;</p>
<p>So our next goal is to take the therions from their prisons, and hide them from the Abbey.</p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s determined to take care of his bug.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Yeah. You take real good care of that thing now, got it?&quot; Oh Rokurou, you sounded like <a href=http://voltron.wikia.com/wiki/Shiro>Shiro</a> there for a second.</p>
<p>Rokurou agrees with the idea of having a hideout as well. He asks Eizen if he has a base. Nope.</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s thinking of a place to have malevolence available for the therions, but out of the Abbey&#39;s reach.</p>
<p>But we decide to stop by Loegres in Midgand this time.</p>
<p>Grim looks grim and deep in thought. She&#39;s thinking of something else...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Back at the port, there&#39;s some tension going on between the other pirates!</p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s worried about them...</p>
<p>Velvet tells him not to worry.</p>
<p>But Benwick&#39;s not happy as the price to dock the ship has risen!</p>
<p>We definitely need a hideout.</p>
<p>So we&#39;re now &quot;most wanted&quot; in the capital. Devilry.</p>
<p>Eizen gives up arguing and has Benwick pay the fee.</p>
<p>That&#39;ll be the last time we dock at the port...</p>
<p>We get a <strong>Jacketless Outfit</strong> for Eleanor!</p>
<p>And our expedition turned up something super nice: a <strong>Bodhi Blastia Bracelet</strong> nxn Lhev&#39;f Oenpryrg! I read the description: it curses the wearer &quot;with a sweet tooth!&quot; Hee.</p>
<p>Magilou has Eleanor try on the bracelet. She refuses. They keep on reciting expressions to each other, ending with &quot;even Eleanor sometimes nods.&quot;</p>
<p>I save here and wander around port.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Rumors are spreading that we may have summoned a dragon from Lothengrin...</p>
<p>Inside the inn, I hear merchants profiting off of the Gate&#39;s closure. There&#39;s also friends of theirs trying to bribe the Abbey to delay Gate repairs. No go. They&#39;re more uptight than the church is.</p>
<p>Laphicet finds the idea of the good stuff in the bad interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;There&#39;s a front and back to every coin.&quot;</p>
<p>There&#39;s a lot of <em>quid pro quo</em> going on between the merchants here...</p>
<p>The sailors aren&#39;t too happy about going around Vortigern to go to Reneed, now that its closed off to everyone. They think that the Abbey hasn&#39;t been doing a good job. They talk about us too.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Yep. Standing right here.&quot;</p>
<p>The sailors now mention our exploits in full, even the real story about High Priest Gideon&#39;s fate.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Looks like our infamy is growing by the day.&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Maybe they&#39;ve even put a bounty on us by now.&quot;</p>
<p>Magilou&#39;s still a bit insulted at the labels the sailors are giving us.</p>
<p>Velvet considers the confusion as a plus to us.</p>
<p>A merchant&#39;s shocked about Southganders eating pengyons, yet delivers a pack of raw rappig. Hypocrites!</p>
<p>The Aifread pirates work on repairing the <em>Van Eltia</em>.</p>
<p>We get a history of the <em>Van Eltia</em>. So the Midgand kingdom built this ship. Its engineer came from &quot;the far continent.&quot; But it&#39;s a cursed ship, taking out its captain, first, and second mate before Aifread and Eizen came along.</p>
<p>And an interruption offline ensues! I&#39;ll have to stop here since I&#39;ve covered a lot of ground for this session today!</p>

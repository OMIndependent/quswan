<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>Nothing new from our expedition so far...</p>
<p>But I get into a back attack with lizard priests!</p>
<p>Laphicet points out Mahina turned into a daemon while trying to find Kamoana her daughter...poor her...</p>
<p>She&#39;s still looking for her daughter.</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;Rokurou, Dyle, and Kurogane all remember what they wanted when they were human, right?&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s considering other possibilites.</p>
<p>Eleanor denies that daemons &quot;have a sense of motherhood.&quot; My lord, the prejudice against daemons is strong in Eleanor! But she says that&#39;s not Mahina now...</p>
<p>Rokurou and Laphicet are in shock at what she&#39;s saying here about Mahina...</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;Velvet and Rokurou still have empathy.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor recalls her memories of her village getting attacked by daemons.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Thus my path is clear.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s considering mercy killing at this point too. Laphicet&#39;s face is too sad...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I get to another <strong>skit</strong> where Rokurou asks if Innominat&#39;s an Empyrean or not...</p>
<p>Rokurou explains the embodiment of Innominat &quot;as an eight headed dragon&quot; according to the song.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;The Empyreans are supposed to be these holy beings, but using therions to feed on malevolence sounds more sinister than divine...&quot;</p>
<p>It does sound suspect.</p>
<p>Eleanor agrees Empyreans are malakhim, exceptional ones.</p>
<p>Laphicet wonders what happens if therions meet...</p>
<p>Rokurou guesses they&#39;ll fuse &quot;into a giant horrific monster!&quot; Rokurou, you teaser, but he has a point. Eight heads vs. six allies. Or, maybe the song was being abstract...</p>
<p>Magilou jests that she could cast a double!</p>
<p>Laphicet thinks each head might have their own free will...</p>
<p>And more teamwork speeches! Velvet, Eizen, and Magilou don&#39;t buy it.</p>
<p>We face another quartet of sword wielding <strong>Guard</strong>s before going to the west corridor and to the door there.</p>
<p>More stairs to climb, and we find another chalice!</p>
<p>I turn on the chalice here!</p>
<p>The waterfall that pours down creates a bridge!</p>
<p>But we can&#39;t go further...</p>
<p>I shut off the waterfall, the bridge is still there!</p>
<p>Into the next door where I see another chalice, and the way back down...</p>
<p>Another crack in the wall behind the chalice...</p>
<p>I break through, finding another monolith with a gem and a Katz Box east of it!</p>
<p>The Katz gives us a <strong>Void Normin Set</strong> costume for Eizen.</p>
<p>I pull the <strong>Flower-Shaped Gemstone</strong> out and place it on the pedestal.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Time to dry the waterfall here...</p>
<p>I use the lift at the edge to go back down.</p>
<p>We head to the center door. Velvet thinks there&#39;s a certain way to open the door...</p>
<p>Magilou thinks there&#39;s traps if one opens that door improperly.</p>
<p>She notices the gemstones embedded in the door.</p>
<p>She thinks it might have something to do with the chalices...</p>
<p>I head east and use the lift to go up. The way to the east room aheads broken...</p>
<p>I head back down and enter into the room nearby.</p>
<p>And there&#39;s more soldiers here...</p>
<p>Expedition&#39;s returned, and they found a set of <strong>Glowing Gears!</strong></p>
<p>The expedition has a new island to explore: The <strong>Krityan Archipelago!</strong> N <em>Irfcrevn</em> ersrerapr! Lrf!</p>
<p>Rokurou wants to cut those gears into pieces. No go, so he decides to cut Velvet&#39;s hair instead. I also learn that Rokurou&#39;s &quot;the barber&quot; in his clan. Lol...Velvet says no to that. She doesn&#39;t trust men touching her hair. She&#39;s smart.</p>
<p>I shut off the waterfall west of here...</p>
<p>I pick a fight with the <strong>Hammerer</strong> malakhim. They can poison us too!</p>
<p>Next door, I shut off the waterfall here as well.</p>
<p>I head back. It seems the chalice shut off the waterfall blocking a chamber in the east room.</p>
<p>Inside the chamber there&#39;s a monolith, and behind that, a chest, with a <strong>Gradient Doll</strong> inside!</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I read the monolith next: </p>
<p>&quot;<strong>The lock of the sacred sealed door</strong> [the door in the center] <strong>is governed by the blue and white jewels of the seven chalices.</strong></p>
<p><strong>When the jewels of the chalices shine, the jewels of the door shall shine alike.</strong></p>
<p><strong>When the seven jewels shine in unison, the way to the inner sanctum shall open.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Hmmm, another puzzle...</p>
<p>Since there are seven chalices total, their pedestal gems correspond to the gems in the door....</p>
<p>The flower gems are white, the teardrop gems are blue...</p>
<p>I figure out the puzzle for a while here.</p>
<p>I check the center door again, and six out of the seven jewels are shining...</p>
<p>I turn the chalice in the east room back on, and it seems that &quot;mana&#39;s [starting] to permeate the temple.&quot; This means we&#39;ve opened the door! <strong>Yes!!!</strong></p>
<p>I save before heading in the center door...</p>

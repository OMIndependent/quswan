<p>A pirate&#39;s trying to make sure his anthem sticks. Velvet tells him to let that go.</p>
<p>Kurogane and Dyle mention the two docks.</p>
<p>I head to the south entrance of the hideout, and check out the inn, which is just a storage place with beds.</p>
<p>I also find our first <strong>Arcane Bottle</strong> in a chest there!</p>
<p>Outside at the south dock, nothing to see here...</p>
<p>I check out the prison cells for any new treasures.</p>
<p>We go down to the depths...</p>
<p>Magilou&#39;s sitting down on one of the steps there...</p>
<p>Laphicet pulls out his compass.</p>
<p>He explains about the earthpulse points.</p>
<p>Eizen points out Laphicet&#39;s intuition in sensing earthpulse points.</p>
<p>Laphicet then infers that he might find other points using the earthpulse point in the cell. But he&#39;s not sure if they&#39;ll find a therion in the other earthpulse points.</p>
<p>Velvet asks him to try.</p>
<p>A light shines around Laphicet.</p>
<p>The same senses happen...</p>
<p>He sensed a lot of earthpulse points, along with bigger ones.</p>
<p>Laphicet tells us the cell is &quot;one of the big ones,&quot; and points to two others east and southeast, which are Warg Forest and Palamedes.</p>
<p>This means therions could be found at &quot;larger&quot; points.</p>
<p>Eleanor points out we have <strong>three</strong> therions left to find! I count the ones we have so far: the <strong>beetle</strong>, <strong>Kamoana</strong>, <strong>Griffin</strong>, and <strong>Velvet</strong>.</p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s a good motivator to Laphicet. Magilou exaggerates by calling him &quot;one of the wonders of the world.&quot; Oh, Magilou.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;Then let&#39;s go therion-hunting! We have an honest to goodness lead!&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Or dishonest to badness in our case...&quot;</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Back at the entrance where Dyle, Kamoana, and Kurogane are...</p>
<p>Kurogane&#39;s still having a hard time trying to forge his ultimate weapon.</p>
<p>Dyle thinks it&#39;s his armor that&#39;s too tough.</p>
<p>Kurogane uses his armor to test his sword&#39;s sharpness.</p>
<p>Orichalcum&#39;s his next move.</p>
<p>Laphicet points out it&#39;s &quot;the strongest metal in the world.&quot; And rare, according to Eizen.</p>
<p>Kurogane mentions he found orichalcum in an &quot;ancient ruin some two hundred years ago.&quot; But it sank with the ship carrying it.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;From the depths of the earth to the depths of the sea...&quot;</p>
<p>Dyle&#39;s getting interested...</p>
<p>But it&#39;s a fruitless mission to find it.</p>
<p><strong>Kamoana:</strong> &quot;Even Dyle&#39;s getting angry!&quot; Hee...</p>
<p>Kamoana laughs so joyfully for the first time in ages...</p>
<p>Velvet asks where the largest earthpulse point that&#39;s not Warg or Palamedes is. It&#39;s out west.</p>
<p>I survey around Titania to talk to everyone else. Kurogane and Dyle first.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>A skit between Kurogane and Dyle takes place.</p>
<p>Dyle complains about all of the expeditions he has to make. Poor Dyle. Kurogane thinks it&#39;s because he&#39;s trustworthy. But, the crew never sends Kurogane on missions...it&#39;s because he&#39;s forging weapons, and fixing stuff.</p>
<p>There they go again...</p>
<p>Dyle and Kurogane then complain about all the work they do together.</p>
<p>Kurogane points out that he doesn&#39;t have a face. Dyle meant that as an expression. Then they argue yet again, with Kurogane making a &quot;tail between legs&quot; expression. Dyle doesn&#39;t have a tail. Hee, these two.</p>
<p>I rest twice at the prison futons in the room near the south entrance.</p>
<p><strong>First skit:</strong> Laphicet&#39;s reading another book, about surveying. He&#39;s so happy...I can&#39;t believe this is the same malak that used to have no free will and was enslaved by Teresa!</p>

<p>Eizen feels what he feels. That feeling of exploration with treasure as &quot;a bonus on the side.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou asks Laphicet about the world map that he dropped when they met. It was only the areas that were Abbey-approved. He only saw the places he could get to on foot.</p>
<p>Eizen&#39;s line here could fit as an inspirational quote: &quot;Adventures are about achieving your ambitions and leaping across the walls we&#39;ve built to protect ourselves, no matter what danger that waits on the other side. There are no big or small adventures.&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet asks about his own trips out of Hellawes and Figahl Icecaps to Eizen to see if they were adventures.</p>
<p>Eizen asks Laphicet how he felt when he snuck out of the Abbey: &quot;Scary, but fun.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Then it was an adventure. The map you made within yourself is a treasure that&#39;s only yours.&quot;</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Second <strong>skit:</strong> Laphicet reads another book.</p>
<p>Velvet complains about that. Oh, Velvet.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;Knowledge opens up bigger worlds.&quot; My goodness, Eizen&#39;s filled with quotable sayings.</p>
<p>For Laphicet, reading was an escape from living under Teresa&#39;s control.</p>
<p>Dyle joins in the skit too!</p>
<p>Laphicet mentions the book he&#39;s reading: about dinosaurs. Velvet finds them similar to dragons.</p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s in awe at the dinosaurs.</p>
<p>Rokurou considers them to be &quot;great sparring partners!&quot; He points out the gigantospinosaurus, or the &quot;dual-bladed dragon.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s smiling now that he&#39;s found his dinosaur opponent. Go fight Lloyd, Rokurou.</p>
<p>Dyle thinks the dinosaurs are his &quot;ancestors.&quot; As Rokurou points out, though, Dyle was once human. Hee...</p>
<p>I save and stop here for tonight.</p>

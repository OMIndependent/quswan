<p>Kamoana saw the pirates mourning. She thought the &quot;daemon [Aifread] was really scary...&quot;</p>
<p>Many of Aifread&#39;s crew&#39;s gone...</p>
<p>Even Dyle thinks a captain killing his own crew is the worst way to go...</p>
<p>We ask Grim about the four Empyreans. Once Innominat&#39;s domain is closed, the malakhim are free from the exorcists, says Eleanor.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;More importantly, Innominat will lose the ability to enhance the resonance of his exorcists. Most exorcists won&#39;t be able to perceive malakhim at all. Of course, anyone as innately gifted as me is another story.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s worried that she won&#39;t see Phi at all...but she proceeds with the plan anyway. <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;But these...Empyreans, they&#39;re gods right? You sure it&#39;s okay to disturb their beauty sleep?&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Waking them is likely to upset the balance of the world quite a bit.&quot; Coming from Magilou, that&#39;s a big understatement there.</p>
<p>Velvet thinks they may have to bring &quot;a sacrifice in an earthpulse on a Scarlet Night.&quot;</p>
<p>Grim points out they need to offer a &quot;soul free of malevolence.&quot; They don&#39;t need to take care of anyone...</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Doesn&#39;t Velvet have a bellyful of them?&quot; She smirks at Velvet&#39;s direction.</p>
<p>Magilou thinks that Velvet can take out the exorcists&#39; souls she consumed. Namely, Oscar and Teresa. Holy heck...</p>
<p>Velvet asks Grim when the next Scarlet Night will happen.</p>
<p>Grim tells us the next Scarlet Night&#39;s coming...&quot;soon.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou wonders if there&#39;s enough time for that...</p>
<p>Grim mentions a &quot;lifepool&quot; of sorts to awaken all four Empyreans at once. Hmmm...</p>
<p>Grim explains vertically flowing earthpulses, which &quot;collects&quot; down into the base of the earthpulse, which is a lifepool. When flowing up, it&#39;s a lifespring.</p>
<p>This talk of lifesprings and lifepools reminds me of the Nofbecgvba naq Enqvngvba Tngrf va <em>Nolff</em>...</p>
<p>Grim knows there&#39;s a lifepool in northern Midgand, but she mentions a temple&#39;s there.</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s the Empyrean&#39;s Throne!&quot;<br>
<strong>Grimoirh:</strong> &quot;Ah, most unfortunate.&quot;</p>
<p>Phi suggests a lifespring.</p>
<p>Velvet decides to force feed the offering through the lifespring! Now this is getting interesting...</p>
<p>Rokurou asks where that is. Eizen points out that it&#39;s in <strong>Mt. Killaraus</strong>, the volcano up at Northgand.</p>
<p>Magilou calls the volcano a &quot;hellscape of ice and lava.&quot; So, in a way, Mt. Killaraus is this game&#39;s literal Hailfire Peaks.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;So in short, we shove the souls of the exorcists into the molten core of that volcano.&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor thinks it&#39;ll work, and they&#39;ll seal Innominat that way.</p>
<p>Alright, it&#39;s settled! Off to Northgand!</p>

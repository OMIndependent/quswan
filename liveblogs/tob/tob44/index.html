<p>Rokurou and Magilou are...somewhere else...</p>
<p>Magilou&#39;s a bit bitter that Laphicet &quot;opened an earthpulse.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Guess this is the end of the Velvet World Tour Revengeathon. What an anticlimax. Not that I care either way.&quot;</p>
<p>The Revenge-a-thon is still going, Magilou. It&#39;s just taking a long commercial break...</p>
<p>Magilou thinks it&#39;s over now that Velvet knows how powerful the Shepherd is. She bets Rokurou 10 gald that she&#39;s right.</p>
<p>Rokurou takes her up on that bet.</p>
<p>A bright pulse of light shines...</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s back! So&#39;s Eizen.</p>
<p>Magilou has her hands up! It looks like she got caught doing something bad.</p>
<p>Velvet, in anger, asks where Eleanor sent Laphicet.</p>
<p>Lol...Velvet&#39;s standing on top of Rokurou...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/euEUu1j.png alt="rokurou don't like" width=480 height=270 id=hd-liveblog></p>
<p>Velvet gets off of him and explains everything that&#39;s happened so far.</p>
<p>Eleanor and Laphicet aren&#39;t far off then...</p>
<p>Velvet decides to find them!</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> (to Velvet) &quot;Sheesh, are you never not worked up about something?&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s serious. She then smiles a very gleefully evil smile.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/g3Lr1w0.png alt="velvet smile" width=480 height=270 id=hd-liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Besides, [Laphicet&#39;s] power is just what I need.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou tells Magilou to pay up. Lol...oh, Magilou...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We&#39;re at the <strong>Yvolg Ruins, Forgotten Edifice</strong>.</p>
<p>I like the way the doors open in this dungeon, it feels <strong>Zelda</strong>-esque!</p>
<p>More exploring, and I get a <strong>Weathered Guardian</strong> for Magilou in a gilded chest here!</p>
<p>We climb up more stairs...</p>
<p>There&#39;s a slow-moving bat with wide wings and a winged skeleton...it turns out the slow-moving bat is a <strong>Devil!</strong></p>
<p>The winged skeleton&#39;s actually an <strong>Undead Magician</strong> with a purple cape instead of wings!</p>
<p>Turning a corner, we see a brick wall! A cracked brick wall...</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;Oh no, a dead end! And so the adventure came to a close in most sudden and unsatisfying manner.&quot;</p>
<p>But Velvet and I know the wall&#39;s cracked, and Velvet roundhouse kicks the wall out!</p>
<p>More stairs to climb...</p>
<p>On the upper floor, we get the jump on Armored Centipedes!</p>
<p><strong>Skit:</strong> Rokurou&#39;s still taking in the info about exorcists being malak&#39;s vessels. He asks Magilou if she could do that as well. She can.</p>
<p>Magilou mentions that she&#39;s won a &quot;Malakhim&#39;s Choice Award&quot; for &quot;Most Desirable Vessel&quot; three years in a row...poor Bienfu.</p>
<p>Velvet asks if Magilou could replace Eleanor as Laphicet&#39;s vessel. Nope. Velvet offers to eat Bienfu. Oh, god...not a chance, though.</p>
<p>Laphicet &quot;held his own against the power of Innominat.&quot;</p>
<p>Looks like this malak&#39;s more powerful than the party counted on...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Another skit:</strong> Rokurou asks where they are right now. Eizen thinks they&#39;re in an &quot;underground temple of Eumacia.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;<strong>Eumacia, the Empyrean of Earth.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou asks how the builders knew where an earthpulse was.</p>
<p><strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Just wham, there it is?&quot;</p>
<p>Eizen explains that humans can&#39;t sense earthpulses in the present time. But, long ago, they had that gift to sense the earthpulses and knew where to build the temples.</p>
<p>More history...</p>
<p>Rokurou wonders if the builders found any &quot;rare ores&quot; to make swords with. Jeez, Rokurou...</p>
<p>Eizen&#39;s done with Rokurou. Velvet points out that Eizen enjoys talking about ruins and art...she&#39;s right.</p>
<p>Turning a corner, we see a Turtlez guy, but we head downstairs...</p>
<p>We avoid the monsters to head to another dead end, where I spy a cracked brick wall northwest.</p>
<p>Magilou magikazams the brick wall away!</p>
<p>We found a treasure trove of Katz spirits!</p>
<p>Along with a side helping of Centipedes and Undead Magicians!</p>
<p>Returning, I see another gold chest with a <strong>Thorny Waistcoat</strong> inside!</p>
<p><a name=a></a></p>

<p></p><h2 class=entry-title>Tales of Berseria - Part 44a: Magilou vs. White Turtlez</h2><p></p>

<p>We talk to the White Turtlez guy again!</p>
<p>Velvet demands supplies from him.</p>
<p>He asks for &quot;extra&quot; money. Velvet asks how much more.</p>
<p>Magilou smirks, and tells the merchant about a &quot;spooooky monster&quot; that eats merchants. She describes said monster (Velvet) in the scariest detail possible. In the case of Turtlez, this monster starts off with the shell.</p>
<p>The Turtlez gives in quickly.</p>
<p>Velvet tells Magilou to give him &quot;the smile that he lives for.&quot; </p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Z6iZTYG.png alt="magilou smile" width=480 height=270 id=hd-liveblog></p>
<p>The poor White Turtlez weeps his heart out...hee...</p>

<p></p><h2 class=entry-title>Tales of Berseria - Part 44: Yvolg Ruins (continued)</h2><p></p>

<p>We do business at the Turtlez Shop.</p>
<p>After more weapon customizations, we a get another ventite!</p>
<p>A few more things to do in the shop, and we&#39;re off!</p>
<p>I go down the eastern staircase...</p>
<p>Which way, which way?</p>
<p>At the end of our little trek, I find a gold chest with <strong>Tarnished Earrings</strong> inside!</p>
<p>Heading back up, and taking the west staircase, I see a Katz Box in the other side of the room!</p>
<p>I rescue the Katz there, who gives us a <strong>Drop Earring!</strong></p>
<p>We move forward and climb another set of stairs, where I spot another code red daemon!</p>
<p>It seems the Undead Magician has some water spells up their sleeves!</p>
<p>Back down, it looks like I missed a brick wall! And another!</p>
<p>I found the exit!</p>
<p>In one battle, Magilou performs her Mystic Arte: <strong>Ascending Angel!</strong></p>
<p>One more flight of stairs, and we&#39;re now in the upper floors of the ruins!</p>
<p>Now more stairs and a door...</p>
<p>...we arrive in a large room with a thick column in the middle. No sign of Eleanor or Laphicet.</p>
<p>We&#39;re now at the exit, or the entrance, of these ruins...</p>
<p><a name=b></a></p>

<p></p><h2 class=entry-title>Tales of Berseria - Part 44b: The Spider Queen</h2><p></p>

<p>Now to face the code red daemon for this area, the <strong>Spider Queen</strong>...</p>
<p>She&#39;s in a room in the Central Floor of the ruins...</p>
<p>She&#39;s weak against wind and fire artes, but strong against non-elemental and earth arts...</p>
<p>She&#39;s also a good defender!</p>
<p>She shoots a web at Velvet, but lucky she missed!</p>
<p>She uses her web artes to stick Velvet into place and unleash her attacks!</p>
<p>Thanks to the Spider Queen&#39;s Spider Net, Velvet&#39;s movement speeds slowed down to a crawl...</p>
<p>After healing her from the slow movement, I take care of the code red daemon some more before I let loose Velvet&#39;s Mystic Arte!</p>
<p>Looking at the daemon&#39;s stats, the Spider Queen also knows a variety of spells like <strong>Gravity Well!</strong></p>
<p>And thanks to that spell, Velvet&#39;s out of the picture!</p>
<p>But Magilou finishes the job!</p>
<p>We win an <strong>Aspirant&#39;s Ignicite!</strong></p>
<p>Now that that&#39;s over and done with, I save before the ruin entrance!</p>

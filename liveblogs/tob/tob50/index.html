<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>The Swordbreaker talked! His final words are &quot;no...&quot;</p>
<p>That man broke Stormquell!</p>
<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> About the guy who finished off the Swordbreaker, his voice sounds familiar...</p>
<p>Eleanor introduces <strong>Shigure</strong>, who&#39;s an exorcist legate! So this guy ranks higher than a praetor, huh? I&#39;m betting Melchior&#39;s the second legate.</p>
<p>I&#39;m right again! Eizen confirms Melchior is the second one!</p>
<p>He turns around with a smile on his face...</p>
<p>He asks Eleanor if she got transformed into a daemon, or if she turned against the Abbey. She doesn&#39;t know what to say. She can&#39;t tell him outright that she&#39;s on a mission!</p>
<p>But he brushes that aside, saying that it&#39;s none of his business. He has a similar personality to Rokurou. I wonder if the Rangetsu clan was well-known for their laidback demeanors, but serious devotion to their traditions? Or is it just these two?</p>
<p>It seems he&#39;s beaten Rokurou to beating Stormquell.</p>
<p>His cat talked, mentioning Rokurou!</p>
<p>Shigure confirms he&#39;s Rokurou&#39;s older brother!</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s a bit shocked!</p>
<p>He taunts and teases Rokurou big time, saying he&#39;s gotten stronger than he did three years ago!</p>
<p>Rokurou pulls out the daggers, and unveils his daemon eye once more!</p>
<p>Shigure&#39;s now more excited to take Rokurou on!</p>
<p>The cat is Shigure&#39;s malak, as she disappears into her vessel...</p>
<p>He draws his big sword, his &quot;real Stormhowl!&quot;</p>
<p>He demonsrates its power, sending huge shockwaves!</p>
<p>Rokurou tells Laphicet to stay back this time!</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>A one-on-one duel using Rokurou alone! This is getting a bit exciting...</p>
<p>Shigure gets the first strike!</p>
<p><strong>Shigure:</strong> &quot;Ha! It&#39;s been too long since we crossed swords, brother!&quot;<br>
<strong>Rokurou:</strong> &quot;Shut up! ...I&#39;ll make you regret sparing my life last time!&quot;</p>
<p>I whittle down his health a bit!</p>
<p><strong>Shigure:</strong> &quot;You&#39;re feisty as a daemon! I like it!&quot;</p>
<p>Oh boy...</p>
<p>Shigure then announces his fight over!</p>
<p>Laphicet worries about Rokurou again, and accidentally has Eleanor save him! Whoops again...</p>
<p>Rokurou pulls out his shattered Stormhowl!</p>
<p>Shigure&#39;s getting more interested...oh god... <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>His malak is summoned!</p>
<p>Shigure then calls the battle over, taunting Rokurou, and points him to the Swordbreaker so he can repair his broken sword...</p>
<p>So the Swordbreaker&#39;s Kurogane himself, huh?</p>
<p>Shigure tells Rokurou he&#39;ll be meeting him at <strong>Port Cadnix</strong> for a rematch. He&#39;s the ticket to get out of Cadnix Island.</p>
<p>Eleanor tries to explain her mission, but he thinks she&#39;s siding with them, since she already saved one of their lives, oops... </p>
<p>Shigure promises to end her if he sees her again. Oh god... <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Eizen knows this isn&#39;t Shigure&#39;s full power...</p>
<p>Velvet thinks of fighting him four-on-one. Kurogane steps in, saying there is only one way to beat him...</p>
<p>Rokurou follows him.</p>
<p>Velvet says to Laphicet that &quot;this is something Rokurou has to do alone...&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor points out Shigure&#39;s stronger than the Shepherd. Oh god...</p>
<p>Magilou compares the crew to pinned mice and the cat as Shigure...he&#39;s taking his time.</p>
<p>In another <strong>skit</strong>, I learn the cat malak&#39;s name is <strong>Morgrim</strong> from Eleanor. But that&#39;s all she knows about her.</p>
<p>Shigure can take on exorcists or daemons even without his malak?!</p>
<p>We&#39;ve never seen him use his malak artes at all...</p>
<p>Eleanor names Morgrim as &quot;one of the seven wonders of the Abbey.&quot; Hmm...</p>
<p>Bienfu steps in, delivering more details about Morgrim, saying Morgrim&#39;s lazy, and that one of the conditions of her pact requires grooming her like a cat.</p>
<p>Velvet doesn&#39;t want to know Shigure&#39;s full power if he&#39;s more stronger than the Shepherd.</p>
<p><strong>Expedition check:</strong> We get another treasure, with the crest of Innominat on it!</p>
<p>From the relic, Velvet realizes the Empyreans&#39; power is even greater than she expected...</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Further on, I head inside a crawlspace into the next area!</p>
<p>Velvet questions Eleanor for attacking one of her own. She lies, saying she was worried about Rokurou. Laphicet&#39;s power made her do it.</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s now raising suspicions...</p>
<p>She tells her to only protect Laphicet, even if other allies take the fall...</p>
<p>Laphicet thanks Eleanor for covering for him.</p>
<p>He also thinks that she would also go out of her way to protect people like her brother.</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s thinking, and wheels are turning...oh god...what is she planning?</p>
<p>I explore these tunnels a bit more, avoiding enemies on the way...</p>
<p>I manage to get earrings for Magilou in a chest, which are effective protection against undead monsters!</p>
<p>We manage to make it down to the depths of the tunnels...</p>
<p>It seems the Swordbreaker&#39;s, or Kurogane&#39;s workshop is nearby...</p>
<p>Finally, a save point!</p>
<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> I accidentally got half-spoiled for Shigure since I might have seen glimpses of him while I was scanning through Tumblr to look for fanart of this game.</p>

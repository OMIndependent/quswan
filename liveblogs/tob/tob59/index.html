<p>We&#39;re now in the southwestern part of the Plateau, the vast part of it...</p>
<p>Holy heck, the place is huge!</p>
<p>We encounter newer monsters here as well...</p>
<p>There&#39;s also a code red daemon in this area.</p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s in awe at the gigantic geysers that look like mountains! Velvet, of the rainbows near them!</p>
<p>Eleanor explains we&#39;re at the Burnack Geyser!</p>
<p>Magilou explains the science of the geysers.</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;<strong>Wowie!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Eleanor&#39;s surprised at the &quot;educational&quot; material Magilou said.</p>
<p>Velvet, quit putting down Magilou.</p>
<p>Then Magilou exaggerates again, mentioning a boiled octopus or a boiled crab shooting out of a geyser on occasion! She&#39;s hungry, I think...</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Magilou...I&#39;m declaring your bizarre imagination the eighth wonder of the world.&quot;<br>
<strong>Magilou:</strong> &quot;People say that all the time.&quot;</p>
<p><a name=a></a></p>

<p></p><h2 class=entry-title>Tales of Berseria - Part 59a: Hungry Like the Wolf</h2><p></p>

<p>After a few battles and item searching, I decide to go after the code red daemon near a chest!</p>
<p>He&#39;s a very giant wolf, a <strong>Breed Wolf</strong>!</p>
<p>He does a lot of leaping strikes at us!</p>
<p>He&#39;s a tough one, nearly destroying half of our party, but we take him down!</p>
<p>We get a <strong>Luminary&#39;s Ventite</strong>, and head back to collect our reward before pressing forward!</p>

<p></p><h2 class=entry-title>Tales of Berseria - Part 59: Return to Burnack Plateau (continued)</h2><p></p>

<p>After tons of monster battles along the way, we arrive at our next stop!</p>
<p><strong>Expedition check:</strong> We&#39;ve got 13 recipes in the bag! 17 more to go! The new recipe we pick up can partially recover KO&#39;the allies in battle!</p>
<p>There&#39;s Eizen standing there near an exorcist campground...</p>
<p>Oh my god, all of the soldiers and orderlies are KO&#39;the!</p>
<p>He asks us if we gave the medicine to the crew. </p>
<p>It wasn&#39;t Eizen who did all of this. It&#39;s Zaveid. All of the exorcists are not dead, though. He&#39;s a fighter, not a killer.</p>
<p>Eizen also knows that Zaveid knows he&#39;s going into a trap. Why spring it and why bring Eizen along?</p>
<p>Eizen also wants to spring the trap to see if Aifread&#39;s at Lothringen.</p>
<p>He tells us the story of how he met Aifread. Aifread told him that the curse is a part of him.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;But if the reaper learns to grasp the wheel of his life, even he may find his creed...his path through stormy waters.&quot;</p>
<p>And thus, Eizen joined Aifread&#39;s crew.</p>
<p>There&#39;s Zaveid hanging out from behind the big tent listening to his story...</p>
<p>But the crew notices, and he comes out of hiding.</p>
<p><strong>Eizen:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s rude to eavesdrop.&quot;<br>
<strong>Zaveid:</strong> &quot;If you&#39;ve got secrets, talk about &#39;em at home.&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet asks if there&#39;s any hope of them working together.</p>
<p><strong>Zaveid &amp; Eizen:</strong> &quot;Not if he&#39;s going to keep acting like this.&quot; Hee...you stubborn malakhim...</p>
<p>Rokurou smiles and crosses his arms.</p>
<p>Zaveid leaves. Magilou wonders why he came out when &quot;he could have just stayed hidden.&quot;</p>
<p>Zaveid has his way of doing things...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Skit:</strong> Eizen and Eleanor explain about Lothringen. Velvet asks Laphicet if he was there with Teresa. He doesn&#39;t remember.</p>
<p>Eleanor explains the exorcist training process, where they are given malak and learn artes suitable based on their mana affinity.</p>
<p>Velvet dreads the orderly exorcist life.</p>
<p>Rokurou&#39;s disappointed by the lack of competition there.</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor:</strong> &quot;People join the Abbey for two reasons: to protect people from daemons and to save the world.&quot; Then what does Shigure&#39;s presence in the Abbey mean? The guy just wants a fight.</p>
<p>Velvet, Magilou, and Rokurou don&#39;t take too kindly about being exorcists.</p>
<p>Eleanor says that they don&#39;t understand &quot;their motives.&quot;</p>
<p>Rokurou, however, wants a fight in Lothringen!</p>
<p>Another <strong>skit</strong> about Zaveid this time. Laphicet points out he&#39;s not scared of him, because he wants a fight for fun, not to kill people.</p>
<p>Magilou thinks it&#39;s because he hangs out with Velvet a lot.</p>
<p>Eizen thinks he&#39;s naive.</p>
<p>Velvet and Eizen don&#39;t get Zaveid at all. Lol...</p>
<p>Eleanor doesn&#39;t get everyone else in the crew.</p>
<p><strong>Expedition check:</strong> We get a new treasure, a <strong>Valkinas Cryas Trinket!</strong></p>
<p>Eizen accidentally made a pun about the new treasure...he denies that.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We&#39;re almost close to Lothringen. We cross a bridge...</p>
<p>There&#39;s another lovely view of the geysers beyond.</p>
<p>Eleanor wonders why Eizen was let into Aifread&#39;s crew. She doesn&#39;t get his answer. Maybe he needs the challenge.</p>
<p>Laphicet wonders if he had the curse.</p>
<p>He would&#39;ve wanted and not wanted Velvet and Eleanor near him, for some reason, if he had it.</p>
<p>Eleanor accidentally compliments Eizen as &quot;a strong man.&quot;</p>
<p>We see the big Abbey wall before us now...</p>
<p>Laphicet asks Eizen about the gun Zaveid wields. To the crew, it&#39;s an unusual weapon. Eizen calls it a &quot;relic.&quot;</p>
<p>At least Eizen admits he and Zaveid aren&#39;t so different...</p>
<p>Aifread (and rightly so) wouldn&#39;t let people touch the gun.</p>
<p>But why would Zaveid go after Aifread for?</p>
<p>Laphicet thinks that he wouldn&#39;t steal anything valuable, maybe hes returning it?</p>
<p>Instead of turning left, I jump down to the shallow watering bed below and find a chest with a <strong>Garish Pink Shirt</strong> inside! Its attack boost is huge, but at the cost of a lower defense...</p>
<p>I turn back and I head inside the Tunnel across the stream, which is the <strong>East Laban Tunnel</strong>.</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Out of curiosity, I head deeper and collect the treasures there.</p>
<p>What have we here? Another set of vines...but there&#39;s a wide chasm ahead...</p>
<p>The <strong>Orbweaver</strong>s here are very tough and clever!</p>
<p>This tunnel is so long and deep!</p>
<p>We free another Katz from a Katz Box and get <strong>Aviator Sunglasses</strong>!</p>
<p>We make it outside to fresh air, but the tunnel continues downward and northward...</p>
<p>Is this place an optional dungeon of sorts?</p>
<p>I now make it to a huge area in the tunnel, but all three ways forward are dead ends...</p>
<p>Lots of Tales coins and spirits here too!</p>
<p>I pick up a <strong>Death Ward</strong> in the north dead end and head back!</p>
<p>For some reason, I&#39;m imagining Rokurou wearing that school uniform from <em>Princess Tutu</em>, blue cardigan, frilly sleeves, and all...</p>
<p>I open the north gate of the plateau to complete the area map, and go back, heading to the west...</p>
<p>There&#39;s the tower in the distance!</p>
<p>Magilou knows this is an obvious trap: no soldiers around. It&#39;s now a matter of when, where, and what the trap is.</p>
<p>I save and stop here for today!</p>

<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>I have Velvet talk to a few villagers now on their way home...</p>
<p>I have Velvet speak to Niko, who&#39;s still fascinated about Velvet&#39;s quiches. She considers selling them to people in Taliesin and they could be rich off of the quiches...she even brings up the idea of wearing matching uniforms.</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s a modest one...she wants a peaceful life.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;Orthie and Russ [Niko&#39;s two dogs] seem pretty down today.&quot; I&#39;m betting that&#39;s not a good sign...</p>
<p>Niko mentions Rollo, a kitty. <a href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/aselia/images/8/8b/Rollo.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150215000024">Hmmm...</a></p>
<p>Velvet calls Orthie and Russ hopeless at guarding things, but Niko calls them very cute.</p>
<p>I dread that there&#39;s going to be something horrible happening soon. A blood red moon is coming in this game, which sort of confirms my dread...</p>
<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> Speaking of blood moons, <a href=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/super-blue-blood-moon-coming-jan-31>there&#39;s going to be an actual blood moon a week from now on the 31st.</a></p>
<p>After picking up more stray items and saving, I head back to the cabin to see Laphi.</p>
<p>Velvet looks at the two graves: one of which is her sister Celica, and Celica&#39;s baby.</p>
<p>Wait, Celica had a child!?</p>
<p>But, Velvet forgot to bring her annual princessia flowers to Celica&#39;s grave...</p>
<p>She apologizes and promises to bring some from the cape in the morning.</p>
<p>Maybe I should&#39;ve gotten to the ruins to get those while we were hunting Prickleboars...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Inside the cabin, Laphi&#39;s at the table, drawing something.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a compass. Laphi&#39;s excited about this &quot;invention&quot; that can make it easy to &quot;voyage across the ocean.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet escorts him off to bed.</p>
<p>Velvet does a passable impression of her master: &quot;Gosh, Velvet, I think it&#39;s time you learned all my secret artes.&quot;</p>
<p>Laphicet knows that he&#39;s not coming home because Seres told him. Who is Seres?</p>
<p>A <strong>malak</strong>? I remember reading in the synopsis about malakhim...are they like those spirits in <em>Zestiria</em>?</p>
<p>Laphicet has &quot;exorcist potential,&quot; according to Arthur.</p>
<p>Laphi wants to be an exorcist. He wishes he could be one. Velvet says he has &quot;20 years, tops&quot; before he can reach Arthur&#39;s level. Oh, Velvet...</p>
<p>She starts her meatball stew for Laphicet.</p>
<p>Out of curiosity, I have Velvet read Laphi&#39;s journal. Note to self: don&#39;t <strong>ever</strong> do this in real life!</p>
<p>Laphi mentions Velvet&#39;s future again in his journal. Let her do what she wants, I say.</p>
<p>Laphicet knew that she would be looking through his journal, that&#39;s why he wrote that.</p>
<p>Now where is that stove?</p>
<p>I light the fire. Laphicet asks for no spinach in his stew. Velvet, as a bonus, decides to also put in Laphi&#39;s favorite curry spices...</p>
<p>I like their interactions, these two.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We get the spices in the attic. Velvet mentions to Laphi that Niko&#39;s coming over in a few days.</p>
<p>Jeez, Velvet peering over Laphi&#39;s love life (even though Laphicet did peer over Velvet&#39;s love life in his journal), and saying an adultist thing in one breath...</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s not ready to have a boyfriend, or &quot;a strange man,&quot; as she says.</p>
<p>Laphicet starts coughing...</p>
<p>Velvet, worried, jumps down and checks up on him. Laphicet just choked while trying to laugh.</p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s concerned about Velvet now.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet:</strong> &quot;For you, I&#39;d kill every last Prickleboar in the forest if it came down to it.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet starts getting dinner ready.</p>
<p>More talk between the two during dinner.</p>
<p>Now for bedtime...and Laphicet took his medicine.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, not tonight, is when <strong>Scarlet Night</strong> happens.</p>
<p>The fire dies down...</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The next morning now...Velvet has a lot on her mind. She&#39;s planning to make a quiche.</p>
<p>But she senses something wrong.</p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s gone. Where did he go?</p>
<p>We search for him in the village.</p>
<p>Velvet asks where Laphicet&#39;s gone to. The shopkeeper hasn&#39;t seen him. But, a book&#39;s on the ground. </p>
<p>It&#39;s a copy of one of Arthur&#39;s tomes...copied by hand. Laphicet didn&#39;t buy the compass at the shopkeeper, he looked at it, though. The merchant&#39;s not telling Velvet what they traded in.</p>
<p>Laphicet&#39;s headed for those ruins in the cape, I bet.</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s thinking he&#39;s picking up princessias to put on Celica&#39;s grave.</p>
<p>We talk to an elderly person, who mentions that Laphicet gave him info on navigation and farming...hmmmm...</p>
<p>The man tells Velvet that this is the first Scarlet Night since the Opening seven years ago.</p>
<p>I go to the gate behind him, and we get our first glimpse of Morgana Woods.</p>
<p>I save and I see a local villager motivating an animal named Tongue Stew to make more milk for the village...</p>
<p>There were supposed to be rabbits and birds around Morgana Woods, but they&#39;ve vanished, according to a few villagers patrolling the area...</p>
<p>There was also an investigation into that, but the group did not make it...oh god...</p>
<p>We turn back to the village. Some villagers don&#39;t believe in exorcists...</p>
<p>A young guy (with a nice hairstyle, imo) is excited for Scarlet Night, mentioning that the lunar eclipse is a &quot;gate connecting the [in-game] world to another&quot; as &quot;proof of humanity&#39;s sins.&quot; Laphi told him about that info.</p>
<p>Niko&#39;s dogs are too terrified to search for Laphi...</p>
<p>The shopkeeper has new wares in stock!</p>
<p>But, I don&#39;t have enough money to buy them...</p>
<p>More items to pick up, and more rappigs to talk to.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a villager with two cats named Othello and Othellina.</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We go into the Tranquil Woods now.</p>
<p>There&#39;s Laphicet!</p>
<p>Velvet&#39;s now giving Laphi a talking-to for up and leaving the house...</p>
<p>Laphi apologizes.</p>
<p>Velvet calls herself a &quot;crummy&quot; sister and knows she can&#39;t give Laphi the things he wanted... <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>But that&#39;s not why he left. </p>
<p>So Laphicet decided to go out and pick up the princessias on his own, and to see the ocean too.</p>
<p>They share another memory back when they were trying to pick up princessias. Laphi remembers that Velvet had a &quot;scary look on her face.&quot;</p>
<p>Laphi found a lone princessia down the hill there.</p>
<p>Velvet asks Laphi what the meaning of princessias are. This is reminding a bit of this manga I read called <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral%3A_The_Bonds_of_Reasoning><em>Spiral</em></a>, naq gur zrnavat bs gur vevf va gurer...</p>
<p>The princessia signifies &quot;good health&quot; and an &quot;irreplacable treasure.&quot;</p>
<p>Velvet mentions &quot;appleboos,&quot; or grated apples on the way. This is pretty heartwarming...Velvet would say &quot;boo boo&quot; if she wanted an apple, hence &quot;appleboos.&quot; Laphi also did that too...</p>
<p><strong>Laphicet:</strong> &quot;Boo...&quot;</p>
<p>Next time, if I make an apple pie, I&#39;m grating the apple, and calling it an &quot;appleboo pie.&quot;</p>
<p>No money from Prickleboars, though...</p>
<p>I make it to the save point before the cape&#39;s incline, and stop here.</p>

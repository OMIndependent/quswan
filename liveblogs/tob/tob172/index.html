<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>Now to place the rest of the orbs in their monoliths!</p>
<p>I get a <strong>Melon Gel</strong> from a chest and make my way down into the core of the domain.</p>
<p>I grab another Melon Gel and head back up...</p>
<p>Last chest in this area&#39;s an <strong>Elixir!</strong> Obviously, this is a sign that this game means serious business!</p>
<p>I place the Celestial Violet Orb into its recess now...</p>
<p>Next to unlock: <strong>The Chamber of Azure Skies!</strong></p>
<p>Now for the last warp point to unlock, the <strong>Chamber of Soaring Trees</strong>, which is way down at the lower parts of Innominat.</p>
<p>Into that chamber we go, where we fight against our first powerful Sub Lord: the many-armed <strong>Vigilante!</strong></p>
<p>The malak is weak to fire, but strong against earth...</p>
<p>We almost lose to him, but we manage to make it!</p>
<p>Our reward is Rokurou learning a new Mystic Arte, and a Soul Break: <strong>Form 9</strong>, and <strong>Vengeful Retribution!</strong></p>
<p>Next chamber: <strong>The Chamber of Twilight</strong>, where the <strong>Sky Soldier</strong> awaits, a giant, glowing white-gold dragon!</p>
<p>The Sky Soldier is weak to non-elemental attacks, but strong against fire, earth, and water...</p>
<p>After a semi-tricky but still long bout, we win Eizen a new Soul Break: <strong>Tyrant&#39;s Fete!</strong></p>
<p>Now the <strong>Chamber of Azure Skies</strong>, where we face off against the <strong>Miraculous Mimic</strong>, which looks nothing like a treasure chest mimic!</p>
<p>The Mimic&#39;s weak against earth, but strong against fire!</p>
<p>As its first action, the Mimic unleashes the Spores from its nearby floating weapons!</p>
<p>This malak monster keeps guarding a lot!</p>
<p>But we manage to finish the Mimic, and win Eleanor a new Mystic Arte and Soul Break (<strong>Gungnir Twister</strong>, and <strong>Strike Drei</strong>), and Eizen gets a new Mystic Arte: <strong>Venom Strike!</strong></p>
<p>On the way to the next chamber, I save at this point.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The <strong>Chamber of Dawn</strong> is next and the malak here is a <strong>Lawless Vessel</strong>, which looks like the pot we faced during the fishing trip episode!</p>
<p>The malak is weak against water and non-elemental attacks, but resistant to wind artes!</p>
<p>Plus, this malak has high defense and reduces all damage on it by 45 points!</p>
<p>As a reward for taking care of the malak, Laphicet learns <strong>Soul Distortion</strong> and <strong>Indignation!</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Chamber of the Pale Moon</strong> is next!</p>
<p>The malak in here is the <strong>Vengeful Goddess</strong>, who is strong to non-elemental and earth artes! She&#39;s weak against wind.</p>
<p>She also has an Iron Stance, meaning she can&#39;t be interrupted while casting an arte! Up to 15 hits, though...</p>
<p>She can also turn the party into stone!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, one of her spells gets us a game over!</p>
<p>Round number two against the Vengeful Goddess!</p>
<p>Once her health gets low, I restrategize a bit...</p>
<p>At this point, I decide to use my items, which I&#39;ve been trying to avoid using for all of the battles since I went into the domain.</p>
<p>After a few KOs, we manage to finish off Major Sub Lord Number 5!</p>
<p>Magilou gets the <strong>Tetra Detonator</strong> Arte Break and her new Mystic Arte: <strong>The Host of Forty-Nine!</strong></p>
<p>I save before the warp point to Innominat and the Shepherd before facing off against the last Major Sub Lord in the <strong>Chamber of Celestial Violet</strong>.</p>
<p>The malak in this chamber is a <strong>Reaper&#39;s Slanderer!</strong> This one has no weaknesses, but has strengths to fire and non-elemental attacks!</p>
<p>I focus on the weaknesses based on the malak&#39;s types (Crustacean, Fiend, and Dragon).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, its artes also end up destroying my party!</p>
<p>This malak also has an Iron Stance!!! Aaaaaaa!!!</p>
<p>We finally manage to take care of the malak!</p>
<p>Velvet learns <strong>Nightmare Claw</strong> and her final Mystic Arte: <strong>Impulse Desire!</strong></p>
<p>And that is that for now!</p>

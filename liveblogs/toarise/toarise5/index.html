<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>Someone in the Iron Mask&#39;s dream calls to him...it&#39;s a name: Alphen.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/znfZndT.png alt=flashback id=hd-liveblog width=480 height=270></p>
<p>He wakes up. How can he see with that thing? Or maybe it&#39;s a one-way mask, where he can see things, and others can&#39;t see his face.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/pDsKymk.png id=hd-liveblog width=480 height=270></p>
<p><strong>Tilsa:</strong> &quot;I&#39;m the medical officer for the Crimson Crows. You&#39;re in one of our safe houses.&quot; Crimson Crows, are they a rebel alliance? Tilsa says yes.</p>
<p><strong>Tilsa:</strong> &quot;Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;ve never heard of us. We&#39;re the Resistance. For the Dahnan people...Is it true you can&#39;t take that thing off?&quot;</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/yw31UBc.png id=hd-liveblog width=480 height=270></p>
<p><strong>Iron Mask:</strong> &quot;Yeah...Worse is that I don&#39;t even know why I&#39;m wearing it. That woman I was with...&quot;</p>
<p>Tilsa points out that the woman&#39;s &quot;quite a character.&quot; She&#39;s in jail.</p>
<p>I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s probably because of her power...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/DE1Yqq2.png alt="can move now" id=hd-liveblog width=480 height=270></p>
<p>I get to move again. We&#39;re in the <strong>Zionne Mines</strong>, a safehouse for the Crimson Crows, according to Tilsa.</p>
<p>I keep asking her all the questions on the choices list.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/4Irsr9C.png alt="told you" id=hd-liveblog width=480 height=270></p>
<p>Zephyr, the tough, bearded guy, is the leader of the Crimson Crows. They&#39;re going up against Balseph and his &quot;bright eyed&quot; troops.</p>
<p>One of the Crimson Crows points out how everyone knows about Iron Mask by one of their couriers, Nayth.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We go to the jail, where Zephyr and the young man are.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/qdXlG15.png alt="near jail" id=hd-liveblog width=480 height=270></p>
<p>The young man touches her again. And he gets another taste of her power...</p>
<p>Iron Mask tries to intervene, but if I were him, I would&#39;ve kept quiet.</p>
<p>Zephyr continues.</p>
<p><strong>Zephyr:</strong> &quot;It doesn&#39;t seem to be poison or magic...Is this the reason Balseph&#39;s soldiers were after you? For the last several days, Balseph&#39;s forces have been getting pretty restless. When we looked into it deeper, the word &#39;thorns&#39; came up over and over again. And now we come across Miss Prickly herself.&quot;</p>
<p>The guard and everyone else knows who she is: <strong>Shionne Imeris</strong>.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/9xdWBqF.png alt="shionne imeris" id=hd-liveblog width=480 height=270></p>
<p>Iron Mask notices too. She&#39;s a Renan.</p>
<p>So Renans are the only people that have surnames in this &#39;verse.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/UnqyKgh.png alt="eyes light up" id=hd-liveblog width=480 height=270></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/w7SaRp4.png alt="big talk" id=hd-liveblog width=480 height=270></p>
<p>Yeesh, what an exchange...</p>
<p>So the Crimson Crows took out their stones by hand...</p>
<p>Nayth is the guard with the spear.</p>
<p>I wonder, are Astral Artes the magic artes in this tale?</p>
<p>Nayth makes the mistake of calling her power an &quot;ability.&quot; Shionne calls it a curse.</p>
<p>The static thorns appear...</p>
<p>Zephyr continues the interrogation, but another noise from above is heard...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The soldiers are now catching up to the Crimson Crows.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/xsWMHOx.png id=hd-liveblog width=480 height=270></p>
<p>Zephyr tosses a sword to Iron Mask!</p>
<p>Zephyr tells Iron Mask not to die as he goes to the front &quot;to welcome [the] guests.&quot;</p>
<p>Nayth and the young man take Shionne with them, both armed to the teeth.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Iron Mask, you get a sword!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/jO1dhtf.png alt="dull sword" id=hd-liveblog width=480 height=270></p>
<p>We now can access the menu!</p>
<p>I have Iron Mask go down the end of the jail to the office, where we take an Apple Gel from a sack.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/E0zYp83.png alt="apple gel" id=hd-liveblog width=480 height=270></p>
<p>I take a peek at the menu again.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/XhnckRJ.png id=hd-liveblog width=480 height=270></p>
<p>Lucky in this game, I can save anytime too. I check the other stuff, with the synopsis first, or activity records.</p>
<p>So a spirit core is basically the stone that siphons off Dahnans&#39; lives...</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Back to the game...</p>
<p>Looks like the way out is clear...</p>
<p>More wounded... <img class=emojione alt=ðŸ˜¦ title=:frowning: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/1f626.png></p>
<p>One Crimson Crow thinks the Renans &quot;play dirty&quot; because of their advanced tech and weaponry.</p>
<p>The Iron Mask is like us: we&#39;re just seeing the world through his eyes.</p>
<p>Our first enemy!</p>
<p>The soldier asks where Shionne is. Iron Mask tries to say something. Don&#39;t say anything!</p>
<p><strong>Iron Mask:</strong> &quot;How&#39;s this for an answer â€” <strong>go to hell!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Now we fight, and a tutorial!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/oZxAjGH.png id=hd-liveblog width=480 height=270></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/LQYunLn.png id=hd-liveblog width=480 height=270></p>
<p>No victory music, huh? I&#39;m guessing it might break the pacing of the game if one was included...</p>
<p>Iron Mask doesn&#39;t have any HP either...</p>
<p>I save and explore around...</p>
<p>We enter the storage room ahead, get an Apple Gel, and see one member crying over his friend...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/8Y6br2b.png id=hd-liveblog width=480 height=270></p>
<p>Oh boy...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/7k3GubA.png id=hd-liveblog width=480 height=270></p>
<p>I try to run, but no choice...</p>
<p>We talk to another member ahead, who wonders how Shionne got a weapon...</p>
<p>There she is!</p>

<p><strong>Zephyr:</strong> &quot;Okay, people, this is it. Ulzebek.&quot;</p>
<p>Iron Mask notices no guards around.</p>
<p>Zephyr thinks that stationing guards in town wouldn&#39;t be practical from their standpoint.</p>
<p><strong>Zephyr:</strong> &quot;The last place they would look for their enemies is on their own doorstep.&quot;<br>
<strong>Shionne:</strong> &quot;That is, assuming anyone actually made it here before us.&quot;</p>
<p>Someone raises their hand and calls out to Zephyr. Our next stop awaits.</p>
<p>We ask a local about the town. Ulzebek is mostly a farming rather than a mining town.</p>
<p>The chicken eggs were taken by the soldiers, though...</p>
<p>One Crimson Crows member is hiding inside a house, still in shock at the power of the soldiers.</p>
<p>One man tells his wife he&#39;s joining the Crimson Crows... <img class=emojione alt=☹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>Going back up, where one man is now thinking of asking the Crimson Crows for more supplies, and out, I notice something sparkling at the town fountain...</p>
<p>Using jump skills, I find an Apple Gel there.</p>
<p><strong>Shionne:</strong> &quot;Should this really be here?&quot;</p>
<p>I go up more steps, where someone is going to be sent back to Mosgul after they&#39;ve recovered... <img class=emojione alt=☹ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>I try leaving, but a guard warns us about the zeugles beyond.</p>
<p>In a circle, people are trying to dissuade someone from joining the CCs. They&#39;ve lost hope at this point...</p>
<p>From a Crimson Crows member, the place I was about to head to was the Iglia Wastes, full of stray zeugles, and ruins...</p>
<p>Climbing up more ladders, one Crimson Crows member has a good message: stay hydrated.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/QPTGgQe.jpg alt="stay hydrated" id=hd-liveblog width=480 height=270></p>
<p>One ladder later, I get some more ingredients...</p>
<p>After some small talk, I make our way to an inn.</p>
<p><strong>Shionne:</strong> &quot;Looks like we get to sleep with a roof over our heads.&quot;</p>
<p>I check around, then the item shop, where it&#39;s a Life Bottle and some meat. Sadly, we have no money...</p>
<p>I sell some stuff and leave...</p>
<p>At least the inn&#39;s free...</p>
<p>I go to the north gate, where a Crimson Crows member warns us about more guards ahead.</p>
<p>Up to the steps to the hideout, Nayth waits for us.</p>
<p>A Crimson Crows member secretly gives rations to a father so he could feed his kids...</p>
<p>After exploring the upper west side of the town some more, I head in.</p>

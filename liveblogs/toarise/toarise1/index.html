<p>Alright, here I go to play the newest entry in the <em>Tales</em> franchise!</p>
<p>The 25th Anniversary Tales logo pops up...</p>
<p>Along with the Unreal Engine logo...</p>
<p>Autosaving prompt&#39;s on, next I choose English voice...</p>
<p>The OP immediately starts playing, showing the cast of characters, the main duo looking on a cliff. Now we see each character: first, the young woman walking opposite people in academic uniform...</p>
<p>There&#39;s a man in a very earthy place...</p>
<p>And there&#39;s Hootle...</p>
<p>And there is Mayor Law...in a blizzard yelling in front of the snowy town...</p>
<p>Who are these villains? Who is that black hooded assassin our masked man is fighting?</p>
<p>And there&#39;s everyone in a grassy plain...</p>
<p>And that&#39;s it for the OP.</p>
<p>I press start, trying to take a screenshot, but no good. </p>
<p>Next, more legalities to go over...</p>
<p>It takes me awhile to read over at this point, I can&#39;t be too careful...</p>
<p>At least the devs are explicit on what data they collect...</p>
<p>I decline the last part of the agreement, which is optional, and is only meant for the devs to collect data.</p>
<p>For some reason, I can&#39;t take screenshots...</p>
<p>I go back to the menu, and to the gallery to double-check. The screenshots I took are there! I do wish there was an indication that I took one...</p>
<p>After taking some out, I fiddle around with the screenshot options, and set it back to easy screenshot mode again...</p>
<p>Back to the game!</p>
<p>While changing subtitle options, I noticed a set of glyphs as a transition effect.</p>
<p>I go back to the PS menu (sorry!) and realize the screenshot notification is off! I turn it back on...now let&#39;s get started.</p>
<p>Adjusting the voice volume, I can hear &quot;Demon Fang.&quot; Looks like this game&#39;s going back to its roots for its protagonist.</p>
<p>After some input fixes, here we go!</p>

<p><strong>Narrator:</strong> &quot;Oh, how wrong we were.&quot;</p>

<p>This tale of Dahna and Rena, is basically a tale of conquest and slavery...lots of fire and heat comes up when the narrator gets to Orbus Calaglia...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Nw9CavL.png id=hd-liveblog width=480 height=270></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ct2zmFx.png id=hd-liveblog width=480 height=270></p>
<p>The only &quot;paradise&quot; for the Dahnans is death...</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong> &quot;So complete is the Renans&#39; domination...&quot;</p>
<p>Lots of miners mining, and carriers carrying, and &quot;knights&quot; overseeing the whole thing...a woman collapses...</p>
<p>A child pushes a barrel that is four times his size...</p>
<p>...and someone stops the blow!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/1snggzi.png id=hd-liveblog width=480 height=270></p>
<p>The iron masked man turns around. For some reason, he couldn&#39;t feel that rod hitting him.</p>
<p><strong>Iron Mask:</strong> &quot;Let me.&quot;</p>
<p>The knight amps up his sardonicness, and his squad (3rd Squad) is ordered to regroup!</p>
<p>He starts rolling the barrel. The masked man&#39;s back is bloody...eee...</p>
<p>The child thanks him. His name is Kohl.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Kohl is worried about the man, as his wounds are getting worse. The iron mask notices, and takes up on seeing Doc.</p>
<p>Doc isn&#39;t too far, just below the hill...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I can&#39;t turn back, though, as the soldiers are there...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/mxEji5E.png id=hd-liveblog width=480 height=270></p>
<p>I check the controls. Seems I can press R1 to open the Tales series&#39;s famous skits, and R2 to dash.</p>
<p>There&#39;s Doc.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/MjhhMMm.png alt=doc id=hd-liveblog width=480 height=270></p>
<p>The iron masked man is holding his not-so-good-arm...</p>
<p>Iron Mask apologizes.</p>
<p><strong>Doc:</strong> &quot;Look after yourself and there&#39;d be no need for sorry&#39;s, would there? Now sit.&quot;</p>
<p>So this Iron Mask has amnesia, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Iron Mask:</strong> &quot;Blank, as always. Nothing but that strange dream.&quot;</p>
<p>Doc points out his equally unusual ability to not feel pain...and also how he can still be injured &quot;just like everyone else.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Iron Mask:</strong> &quot;I watched another slave die today.&quot; Eeee...</p>
<p><strong>Doc:</strong> &quot;Unfortunately, that&#39;s not a rare sight to see in these parts.&quot;<br>
<strong>Iron Mask:</strong> &quot;Dahnans are always dying. And the Renans just watch.&quot;</p>
<p>Iron Mask is not taking it anymore. He may not feel physical pain, but he does feel the emotional pain of others...he asks why they can&#39;t fight.</p>
<p>Everyone&#39;s resigned to their fate...</p>
<p>Doc looks around, hoping no soldiers catch wind of what Iron Mask said.</p>
<p>300 years of uprisings, yikes...</p>
<p>By the prologue, the Dahnans are clearly outmatched.</p>
<p>Doc tells him not to get into trouble. I chuckle a bit.</p>
<p>Doc tells him to be patient and &quot;wait for the right moment. Both for yourself and the world.&quot;</p>
<p>Doc tells him to walk around a bit, but lay low.</p>
<p>This game does have the feel of epicness written all over it...</p>

<hr>
<p>Now I just gotta rest. Now I can move faster again.</p>
<p>I check the map.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/PnCwInc.png alt=map id=hd-liveblog width=480 height=270></p>
<p>Now to explore the place...</p>
<p>All the soldiers have blocked out the other ways out...</p>
<p>In the way unblocked by guards, I talk to an exhausted man, mentioning being inserted &quot;weird stones on [his] body&quot; and being overworked. He also mentions the soldiers siccing &quot;zeugles&quot; if they get into a fouler mood.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/1tCV2rB.png alt="not have a core" id=hd-liveblog width=480 height=270></p>
<p>Poor Iron Mask...but what is a spirit core?</p>
<p>Up at the foot of the steps, we see another casualty...</p>
<p>Even one of the soldiers is enjoying cremating the corpses...</p>
<p>Another exhausted man sitting tells us about Rena and Lenegis, the moon. I focus the camera on them...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/8ebfZsl.png alt=rena id=hd-liveblog width=480 height=270></p>
<p><strong>Man:</strong> &quot;That Lenegis especially is something else. There&#39;s no way we can ever hope to beat the Renans when they can build floating castles like that.&quot;</p>
<p>So Lenegis is not a moon...</p>
<p>The locals calls the soldiers here &quot;bright eyes,&quot; and they, in turn, call the locals &quot;embeddeds.&quot;</p>
<p>So after the locals mine the fuel, the soldiers burn the fuel? Then why do it?</p>
<p>I turn east, another soldier blocks the way...</p>
<p>Hope there&#39;s no Bonnie Tyler shoutouts re: these soldiers...</p>
<p>There&#39;s lots of patrol here...no rest for these guys...</p>
<p>I go and rest.</p>
<p>The Iron Mask wonders how many people have been sleeping before him before sleeping himself...</p>

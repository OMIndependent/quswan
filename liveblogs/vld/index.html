<p>This is the main page for my liveblog of the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamWorks_Animation>DreamWorks Animation</a> (owned by Comcast and NBC!) action-packed animated series, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltron:_Legendary_Defender><em>Voltron: Legendary Defender</em></a>, which was released on June 10, 2016 on the streaming service Netflix. This show is a reboot of the classic 1984 show, <a href=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Voltron><em>Voltron</em></a>, which itself was a mishmash of two Toei Animation-produced Japanese mecha shows <em>King of the Beasts GoLion</em> and <em>Dairugger XV</em>. <em>Voltron</em> (the 1984 show, not the 2016 show!) was also the first animated show to be released in stereo sound.</p>
<p>So how I first knew of this show was from <a href=http://blog.angryasianman.com/2016/03/voltron-returns-in-new-netflix-series.html>this article on Angry Asian Man that was posted back in March 2016</a>, and what convinced me to give this show a go was that the showrunners, along with the writers there, were <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> alums. Other reasons were because Steven Yeun is voicing someone on that show, and that one of the characters there sort of reminds me a bit of Kyon from <em>Haruhi Suzumiya</em> in terms of his character design.</p>
<p>The watchthrough will cover seasons 2-8 of this entertaining show.</p>

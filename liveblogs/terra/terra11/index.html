<p>Since I have some extra time, I decide to finish completing the rest of the five towers, and revive the world.</p>
<p>My new controller doesn&#39;t want to connect to my Pi for some reason...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/WaDBib1.png alt="tower 3 ext" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Third tower looks the same as the previous two...</p>
<p>The gate rises to let us in. I&#39;m guessing the Guardian from the first tower telepathically told the other four about our arrival.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/1zhmpNe.png alt="center platforms" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The platforms move to the center to let us through, as if they wanted us to move forward.</p>
<p>It seems that Ark can also fall into holes too, like in a Zelda game...</p>
<p>I manage to have Ark jump across the gaps and circle around to the staircase at the north end.</p>
<p>As I go around, the platforms to the next floor fall down...</p>
<p>I double back to the center to take care of more enemies, and check Ark&#39;s stats.</p>
<p>In a certain spot, I slip and Ark falls. Instead of losing health, we&#39;re now in this empty room...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ECcusFU.png alt="empty room" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I have Ark find some Magirock in the west end of the room, and go up.</p>
<p>Menu again. Whenever I press B, Yomi flies to the center door when I&#39;m in another room of the menu.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Dang these flame orbs!</p>
<p>I see a chest nearby, but how to reach it?</p>
<p>Ark walks through a little gap on the right of the stairs, and we&#39;re greeted by another flame orb! We get the stuff in the chest, and head up.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/xT0Dp2l.png alt=gap width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>After a red Huball&#39;s taken care of, Ark levels up!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/H0aXTkR.png alt="level up jump" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Well, this is going to be a bit challenging...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/XWCfwZq.png alt="yikes spears" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>While passing through the hall, I accidentally bump Ark into the point of a spear!</p>
<p>I realize that if I tap twice on the same direction on the control pad, Ark dashes, abg hayvxr Evpugre va <strong>Flzcubal bs gur Avtug</strong>...</p>
<p>Another puzzle...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/brWPdqJ.png alt="arrow platforms again" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>So pushing each button makes the arrow platforms on the right move vertically, and turning them off stops them.</p>
<p>With careful timing, I move each platform into somewhere reachable.</p>
<p>Hoo boy, another hall of spears await!</p>
<p>A text prompt says &quot;Guardner appeared!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Guardner</strong> is a huge, blue-fire specter that shoots out tiny flames!</p>
<p>I have Ark try to hit him, but he&#39;s invincible!</p>
<p>The tiny flame, or the sparkles he shoots out, puts Ark into a deep sleep!</p>
<p>I think Guardner&#39;s weak against magic spells. Sadly, I don&#39;t have any.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Upstairs now, where we run into another Cadet mage. Both Ark and the mage glare at each other for a few seconds...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Zyl9zU2.png alt="third floor?" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>...then we proceed to take care of them!</p>
<p>After leaping past the west gap, I learn that Guardner is basically this game&#39;s equivalent of a Wallmaster!</p>
<p>After making Ark sleepy, he sucks him into a vacuum, and kicks him back to the beginning of the tower!</p>
<p>Back to the fourth floor, where I charge through the floor once again, until a mage glares at Ark and stops him cold for a moment!</p>
<p>I circle around the floor, a bit lost...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/1gyzOO4.png alt="doors open" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Now to revive another continent!</p>
<p>In the next room, we meet another mage, and proceed to quickly take care of them.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/vNpfE2e.png alt="sleepless seal" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I wonder if this <strong>Sleepless Seal</strong> will help? By the jingle that plays after we get the item, it probably will.</p>
<p>According to the description, it will block Guardner&#39;s spell, but can it block other sleep spells?</p>
<p>I equip it, and proceed.</p>
<p>In the eastern end of the room, I get another Magirock.</p>
<p>After clearing the room of enemies, I press the two buttons here to open the door forward.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/q8v74v2.png alt="doors open again" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I manage to flee into the next room before the prompt prints out that &quot;a swarm of Huballs&quot; approach.</p>

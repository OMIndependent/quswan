<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>The camera pans down, showing the scale and might of the first tower.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/oHplUQu.png alt="tower entrance" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/id9Vzev.png alt="tower bottom" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Masked faces on the walls, knights flanked to the tower with swords, and a staircase to a sealed entrance. This tower is definitely not haunted. </p>
<p>But, it&#39;s probably quite ominous.</p>
<p><strong>Ark:</strong> &quot;So this is what [the Elder] was calling a tower. Heh, I&#39;m getting excited here.&quot;</p>
<p>As he runs up the stairs to the entrance...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ilUn17w.png alt="face appear" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Holy heck! A face! Ark&#39;s reaction is the same as mine. He tells the face on the door not to scare him.</p>
<p><strong>Face on gate:</strong> &quot;I am the Guardian. What business have you here?&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;m given a decision. Should I tell the guardian what we&#39;re doing, or to &quot;step aside&quot;? I do the first part.</p>
<p>Ark asks the guardian how he could save his village. The guardian tells us to go inside the tower.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/aR9BemG.png alt="face talk" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Guardian:</strong> &quot;Within wander countless souls of living things. Reach the uppermost floor and gain the power to control the world.&quot; Control the world? Oh dear... <img class=emojione alt=☹️ title=:frowning2: src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/3.1/png/32/2639.png></p>
<p>The guardian knows Ark&#39;s name. Has this Guardian been watching him since he unsealed that box too?</p>
<p><strong>Guardian:</strong> &quot;<strong>Will you test your fate?</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>The face disappears and the way is open.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/9YSSaAY.png alt="way open" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I take a deep breath before entering.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The first two official monsters we face in the tower are some roly-poly-like monsters, except they have one eye!</p>
<p>After a third one is gone, we climb more stairs.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/cVaGy0D.png alt="first floor stairs" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I check the menu, and check the map of the tower.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Z0bA3qv.png alt="tower map 1f" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I wonder how I can have Ark perform the other attack moves?</p>
<p>The second floor&#39;s where the real challenge begins...</p>
<p>I meet up with one of those flame orbs again. I have to remember to be careful about them, since they can hurt Ark pretty badly.</p>
<p>On the other side of the perch, more monsters, and I pick up our first <strong>Magirock</strong> of the game!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/vqVsNWm.png alt="magirock get" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>After descending down the stairs, I check the map again. It turns out I can scroll through the map.</p>
<p>This tower has five floors, the question mark at the top floor probably marking the boss.</p>
<p>After more flame orbs are gone, I see a flashing bulb of light. Is it a fairy?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ilTd4UA.png alt="i am wandering soul" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Soul:</strong> &quot;<strong>Living things have been transformed into monsters.</strong>&quot; What?</p>
<p><strong>Soul:</strong> &quot;<strong>Like you have saved me, save the others.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>The portcullis to the next floor opens up, and the soul vanishes!</p>
<p>I realize our health has recovered after saving that soul, as I proceed to take care of another flame orb.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/NuLOBx4.png alt="level up" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Yay, Ark!</p>
<p>Ark folds his arms and cheers!</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I realize now that Ark&#39;s health regenerates.</p>
<p>Onto the third floor, where more surprises await!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/4PiFDDC.png alt="knight again" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Oh no, it&#39;s that colossus knight again!</p>
<p>Not just one knight, but two of them. Taking advantage of the open space I have, I use it to slowly win the battle, and avoid their mighty lances!</p>
<p>Going up, more enemies, and another Magirock await!</p>
<p>We free another soul, who gives us advice: &quot;<strong>Fighting alone is not strength. Observation is the solution.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>On the left perch, we see more items to take.</p>
<p>Feeling a bit lost, I check the map again, where I see an exit on the southern end of the map.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/L8v8FNB.png alt="south exit" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Yikes!</p>
<p>Lucky Ark&#39;s holding on to a chain...</p>
<p>Up to the fourth floor we go!</p>
<p>The character animation of Ark is so fluid, and it shows when he&#39;s climbing on the chain rope.</p>
<p>Two more monsters to face...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/6bnktSo.png alt="way down" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>It seems like this is going to be a one-way trip.</p>
<p>Falling down, and climbing another staircase, where I see one of those giant lance knights. Without a care, I have Ark charge at them.</p>
<p>Now how to get that Magirock?</p>
<p>Meeting another knight, I pull the same strategy as last time.</p>
<p>Now for the third knight...</p>

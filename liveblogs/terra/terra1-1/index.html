<p><strong>Note:</strong> Since I played this part on different days, this part will be split into two posts.</p>
<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>The logos come up...</p>
<p>Now a red-tinted galaxy pops up...a heart beating...</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>The planet possessed two souls. An external and internal face. Lightside and Darkside. 46 billion years since the planet&#39;s birth. Growth and decline circle two wills. At the will of Lightside, new life is born. At the will of Darkside, ice ages descend. Lightside wills intelligent beings.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>A clock appears, ticking...</p>
<p>A biplane is seen, flying high to the skies...</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Rapid progress takes root.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Heatwaves and fiery landscapes now...with pillars of darkness within the film...</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Darkside breeds fear and disharmony. They came to be called God and Devil.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>The clock&#39;s hands fall off...and dissolves into the earth...</p>

<p>I&#39;m now here at the title screen.</p>
<p><strong>ETA:</strong> <a href=https://youtu.be/u9ibkTbuSBA>The main theme</a> starts off with an air of mystery and beauty, then swells into a &quot;grand adventure&quot; feeling here for a bit, then continues into something simple and beautiful again.</p>

<p><a href=https://youtu.be/78SpNZYdFIg>I like the file select theme</a>.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/QqKaasD.png alt="name input" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>My character&#39;s default name is <strong>Ark</strong>, so I go with that.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>

<p>Someone wakes up Ark...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/DE3q9Yu.png alt="good morning ark" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Her name is Elle.</p>
<p><strong>Elle:</strong> &quot;Are you all right?&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;m personally not too fond of the spacing of the text, but I&#39;m glad the game developers are doing their best to make sure that the text is readable.</p>
<p><strong>Elle:</strong> &quot;Ark. You looked like you were having a nightmare.&quot;<br>
<strong>Ark:</strong> &quot;I&#39;ve been having these strange dreams. Day in, day out, always the same dream.&quot;</p>
<p>Elle tells Ark to get some air, saying she&#39;s never heard him say things like that.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Rgg8rBC.png alt="crystal blu" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The term <strong>crystal blue</strong> is highlighted. Does she mean the sky is clear?</p>
<p>Ark gets up, and I can move about, noticing a book with ink and quill at the end of the table.</p>
<p>Ark has an idle animation, that&#39;s good detail there.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/tcejBre.png alt="ark idle" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Knowing that the book&#39;s a save point, I record my progress.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/zSk3Nzu.png alt=save width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>No menu yet.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I wander around the room, getting used to Ark&#39;s controls...</p>
<p>Holding Y makes Ark run, B makes him jump...</p>
<p>If I keep Ark idle long enough, he wags his finger at me, or taps his foot, arms akimbo.</p>
<p>The guy in the next room with the headband ships Ark and Elle. The other one next to him mentions the Elder, who says that &quot;crystal blue are the tears of the outside world.&quot; Hmmm...the guy doesn&#39;t know what he means by that either.</p>
<p>I go south to the kitchen, where the chef asks me to fetch a vase. I have Ark eat the apples instead. The chef&#39;s not too happy with him doing that.</p>
<p>I pick up the vase, but instead of talking to the chef to give her the vase, Ark throws it! Oops...</p>
<p>Heading west, floating letters read &quot;<strong>Elder&#39;s...</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>The guy at the room wants to see the crystal blue, but might end up losing his sight if he goes out.</p>
<p>He also has another query in his mind:</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/dSFr8nL.png alt=why width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Ageism?</p>
<p>I throw all the vases in the room, and start to go outside, but...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ETruIIe.png alt="elder calling" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I wander around the house again.</p>
<p>Oh, Ark. At least Ark&#39;s more braver than I am...</p>

<p>After my little trip (and it was a good one), I&#39;m back in action!</p>
<p>The final tower is in sight!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/kaWLWGb.png alt="first tower from final tower" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I notice that this world map is pretty small, as we can see the first tower from where the final tower is...</p>

<p>As soon as we enter, Ark is unable to move! What the heck!?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/RcIZ9qj.png alt="cannot move" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>A spotlight appears on the floor, and the Guardian reveals himself!</p>

<p>Hello, Guardian, can you let us out please?</p>
<p>He doesn&#39;t, and he shoots out a beam kicking us out. Yeesh... it seems I may need to get something from the village to go further.</p>
<p>I visit the weavers&#39; house again to get what Elle&#39;s made. Unfortunately, she&#39;s not finished with her work, and asks us to rest. We do so.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lr-gqvaHNdg">The music, when Ark is sleeping, sounds nice</a>.</p>

<p>There&#39;s Ark lying on the floor...and we save before heading out.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Two of the villagers are sleeping soundly.</p>
<p>I go to the Elder&#39;s room, where I decide that&#39;s not a good idea.</p>
<p>The whole house is silent. Crickets chirp outside as the night rolls on...some of the villagers and chickens are still frozen in time...</p>
<p>I decide to go to the weaver&#39;s house to visit Elle again.</p>
<p>Elle stops weaving and recites her prayer.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/pSUQDaC.png alt="elle at loom" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Elle:</strong> &quot;...Crystal cape. I pray to you. I beseech you to shield Ark from harm. And...I pray...Please don&#39;t take Ark far away.&quot;</p>
<p>As Ark approaches Elle, a new tune plays: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acDgcJv7b4Q">her theme</a>.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/AAyTEaf.png alt="ark cannot sleep" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Elle:</strong> &quot;Your cape is almost finished. I will be done tomorrow. Ark. Please get some rest...But when this cape is made, I get this feeling Ark will go far away...You won&#39;t do that, will you?&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;m given a choice. I have Ark say the first one: <strong>Of course not.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ark:</strong> &quot;What are you saying? Who said I&#39;m going anywhere? Yes, I did see the world outside here and learned the world is huge. But...I love this village because Elle lives here. I&#39;m not leaving.&quot;</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ItKiavw.png alt="ty ark" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Awww...</p>
<p>Elle tells us to go back to bed again, and says &quot;[she&#39;ll] wait up for [us]&quot; once her masterpiece is finished.</p>
<p>I wander outside town for a second to see if anything&#39;s changed before going to the Elder, where I&#39;m given the same decisions (about the tower, or the box, or to complain about how tired we are). I&#39;m wondering, does the Elder even sleep? Or is our duty of restoring the towers so important to him that he&#39;s able to stay awake at this time?</p>
<p>The next morning, Ark ends up waking up off the bed again. He&#39;s quite the fitful sleeper, huh?</p>
<p>At the weavers now...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/tqpMjta.png alt="elle finish" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Elle:</strong> &quot;Ark. Did you sleep well? Here. Take this. <strong>Your cape</strong> as promised. It&#39;s light and warm. And I wove in a prayer to protect you from adversity, Ark. I think it will help you, please wear it when you are in trouble.&quot;</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/owfCOJf.png alt="got elle cape" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Now I think we can make it past the fifth tower okay!</p>
<p>With her words of warning to Ark, and her vows of prayer for him, we set off. Outside, I equip her cape.</p>

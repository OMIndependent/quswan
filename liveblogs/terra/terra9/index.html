<p>Awww...</p>
<p>Inside the weavers&#39; house, I have Ark speak to the madam.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/9elcSzL.png alt="i feel strange" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Madam:</strong> &quot;I feel as if I awoke from a long sleep to an unfamiliar place.&quot;</p>
<p>I speak to one of the weavers, who was also dreaming that she was in the city, or &quot;in a busy town with huge buildings&quot;, embroidering.</p>
<p>Two other weavers had the same dream.</p>
<p>The south weaver in the circle says something different.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/6BlsSwB.png alt="was i asleep" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>She then mentions Elle has a special power with her weavings: they &quot;evoke happiness.&quot;</p>
<p>The weaver upstairs says the same thing.</p>
<p>I go to Elle.</p>
<p>She&#39;s at the loom, weaving the Elder&#39;s cloth.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/vAYgJF9.png alt="elle ark" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Elle:</strong> &quot;While I was barely conscious, I came to understand. That it was you [...] who saved me. I...I know now for whom this weaving is intended. Ark. Just as you fought to save us, I, too will help you. I will weave my soul into what I weave for you, Ark.&quot;</p>
<p>So I was right, the piece that the Elder commissioned was for Ark.</p>
<p>I go back to the Elder. Same decisions pop up.</p>
<p>I rest and save before going to the magishop.</p>
<p>Now that I have Magirock, I can get either a <strong>Fire Ring</strong> or an <strong>Ice Ring</strong>...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/oqdrlCj.png alt="fire ring" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I pay 5 gems and 1 Magirock to get an Ice Ring.</p>
<p>Now I can perform magic, ho ho ho...</p>
<p>But in case any magical accidents happen when I&#39;m trying to take screencaps, I unequip the jewel box.</p>
<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> In order to cast magic, I press Y. But to take a pic, I have to press Select and Y, which might have Ark either go into the menu box, or cast a spell, depending on which button the game sees me press first.</p>

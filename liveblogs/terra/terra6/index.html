<p>From the title screen, I&#39;m guessing that cloth the Elder commissioned Elle to weave was not for him, but for Ark.</p>
<p>I wander around the Elder&#39;s room. He&#39;s not back.</p>
<p>I try to go outside, but at the entrance room, the Elder&#39;s waiting.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/DEQCChS.png alt="elder waiting" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Ark demands an explanation. The Elder calls him an &quot;enormous fool.&quot; What did we do? He blames Ark for opening the blue door.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/WUWCgE1.png alt="door not be open" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>He asks Ark if he wants to turn them back from their frozen state. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Elder:</strong> &quot;So be it. Ark, go out of the village. Five towers await you.&quot;</p>
<p>What do those towers represent?</p>
<p>Ark&#39;s curious about what&#39;s outside the village, and the towers.</p>
<p><strong>Elder:</strong> &quot;The gate is open. <strong>But have you the ability to succeed?</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>He brushes us aside and goes to his quarters. </p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I have Ark follow him to explain about the towers.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/3dUjYYm.png alt="you no" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Well, that&#39;s helpful.</p>
<p><strong>Elder:</strong> &quot;No one here has ever set foot outside. Five towers await outside, each one controlling living things. That is all. You must seek the answers in the towers yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>I ask about the box next.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/xOKOsCP.png alt="world oppo ours" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>So this game has two worlds, fvzvyne gb <em>Flzcubavn</em>, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Elder:</strong> &quot;By freeing [the box], you upset the natural balance of this world...&quot; So that&#39;s why he&#39;s blaming Ark, all because he broke the seal on a simple jewel box.</p>
<p><strong>Elder:</strong> &quot;But its real significance you will come to learn yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>I go to the chests. The Elder obliges us to take whatever&#39;s in there.</p>
<p>We get an <strong>S. Bulb</strong>, and 50 gems. I&#39;m guessing the gems are the currency for this game.</p>
<p>The <strong>S. Bulb</strong> is basically like an herb of sorts.</p>
<p>Outside, Ark notices something...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/U8L3BqM.png alt="gate appear" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Ark:</strong> &quot;...Outside, huh? Sounds exciting! I&#39;ll go anywhere!&quot; I wish the Elder hadn&#39;t shut out everyone from the outside world, even if he meant well.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Now we&#39;re at the world map, where Ark is wearing a red mantle.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/nJsmZUk.png alt="world map" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>So the whole village is surrounded by a lava river, huh? With crystal, or icy, mountains as well. What is this world?</p>
<p>Every liquid in the world is filled with lava instead of ocean.</p>
<p>Southwest, we see a tall spire. This must be one of the towers that the Elder mentioned to us.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/UeECiJA.png alt="first tower" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Going north from there, we see another tower.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/01Sd4au.png alt="second tower" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>And to the northeast, a third tower...</p>
<p>The Elder mentioned that there were five towers in all. But which one to go to first?</p>
<p>Entering this location leads me inside a facility of sorts.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/dbAJBl7.png alt=location width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>But there are orb-like security enemies with flames surrounding them.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/QAa13iq.png alt="flame orbs" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I go to the menu to equip the <strong>Crystal Staff</strong>, which is what Ark&#39;s already equipped with, and proceed to take care of them.</p>
<p>But, a colossus of a knight comes forward.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/xMLr5bo.png alt="big knight" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We retreat.</p>
<p>While on the world map, I cannot select the menu box.</p>
<p>Back at the village now, the merchant here is not frozen! I buy another S. Bulb, or is it a small bulb of garlic?</p>
<p>The hooded mages are also alright.</p>
<p>I have Ark rest a bit and save before venturing into the first tower we saw.</p>

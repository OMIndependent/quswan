<p>And we&#39;re back at the bird sanctuary!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/VzaOxGN.png alt="bird sanctuary restored" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>A grown parakeet wants to fly, but hasn&#39;t been given the go-ahead from Windvale.</p>
<p>The small birds can&#39;t talk, though...</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the wind isn&#39;t blowing, so the birds are stranded.</p>
<p>A seagull&#39;s roosting and pecking at the sand...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/3onJqSo.png alt="just a migratory guy" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>His personality is sort of like Bonaire&#39;s from <strong>Alundra</strong>. He asks us if we want to hear a song. I say no. He turns his head and sighs.</p>
<p>I check around the sanctuary, and outside of it to see if anything&#39;s changed.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/YWvN2wZ.png alt=waterfall width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I go back to the seagull again, and listen to his singing.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/9iRoylg.png alt=bro width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The music begins to slow down...</p>
<p>Now our next stop is Windvale...</p>
<p>But how to get there?</p>
<p>A bit lost, I wander around the world a bit, even going back to Evergreen. But I end up returning to the bird sanctuary.</p>
<p>It seems that the little birds can talk...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/5AXdod0.png alt="kingbirds nest" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Some small birds want to be like kingbirds...</p>
<p>The small bird at the entrance greets us to the sanctuary, giving us a small pleasantry.</p>
<p>By accident, I find out Ark can climb this rock wall...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/WB6jI2D.png alt="ark can climb cliff" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I have Ark continue up to the top of the sanctuary, where the kingbirds&#39; nests are.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Whoa...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/6Ciy9om.png alt=kingsnest width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We speak to one kingbird, who explains that they build their nests in high places.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/xF7uFG5.png alt="king of birds where" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Another kingbird thanks us for resurrecting their population.</p>
<p>I have Ark climb higher.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Cfoky2y.png alt="small kingbirds" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Awww...</p>
<p>The kingbird chicks are pretty patient. One wants dinner, but waits patiently. Another&#39;s proud that they can stay &quot;home alone.&quot;</p>
<p>One kingbird mentions humans stealing their eggs, probably for meals. But since the human population isn&#39;t back, it&#39;s calm so far.</p>
<p>A crow with a santa hat who calls us &quot;brother&quot; is the shopkeeper for this place.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/11DK4lY.png alt="crow shopkeeper" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I get a healing bulb and a new suit of armor!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/87A1nay.png alt="bird armor" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I have Ark climb to the peak of the cliff here.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/cqdUWgh.png alt="west peak" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The soul is another magishop.</p>
<p>One kingbird points us to where the king of birds is, who&#39;s all the way to the east.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We toss away a rock and climb up the long rope to where the King of Birds is.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/rdLQCfh.png alt="long rope" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>There he is.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/IwiDg18.png alt="king of birds 1" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>He gives us his gratitude.</p>
<p>He knows, though, that we still have a long way to go before everything is restored.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/0IX5vth.png alt="windvale cavern" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I see, that unreachable cavern near the river east of here is probably the entrance to Windvale.</p>
<p><strong>King of Birds:</strong> &quot;Wind from it in the spring tells that we must fly to new lands. But this year, the wind has not blown. We are concerned.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Concerned&quot; is an understatement.</p>
<p>Speaking to the King again, he tells us we can get there by asking the trio of gulls.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/hAkehCd.png alt="eager gull" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>But, I have Ark tell one of the gulls to carry us to Windvale later. The gull&#39;s a bit bummed out...</p>
<p><strong>Okay, that&#39;s it! I&#39;m not sure that I&#39;ll continue this playthrough on the beginning of December like I promised in previous posts, but rather, next year, starting on late February to March! Until then, thank you for reading these liveblogs. Again, it really means a lot!</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> Note that I did not continue the playthrough of this game until late August of &quot;next year,&quot; 2020.</p>

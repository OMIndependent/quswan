<p>Let&#39;s see what tower two looks like...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/AWnZm4q.png alt="tower 2 ext" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>It&#39;s still the same as the first tower on the outside.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Tu4wUj7ZUk">The theme for the second tower sounds different</a>. No, it&#39;s probably because I turned down the volume when I played through the first tower that I couldn&#39;t hear the tower theme properly.</p>
<p>Yep, this tower&#39;s still not scary...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/dM2btOF.png alt="still not scary" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The Huballs here have gotten easier to take care of, as I go through them, and pick up a Magirock.</p>
<p>I go to the east wing and take care of the enemies in this area.</p>
<p>As a reward, a <strong>freed soul</strong> offers me advice: &quot;<strong>Pay heed to the statues and the color of the jewel in the forehead.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>I pick up the chest nearby, which has more money, and continue on.</p>
<p>One of the jewels in the statue&#39;s forehead looks different from the others.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/RKzqPBd.png alt="statue red jewel" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I wonder if I have to cast a spell at the statue?</p>
<p>Nope, it doesn&#39;t work.</p>
<p>I have Ark move to the east part of the chamber and push the red jewel statue there.</p>
<p>Moving it to the left turned off the waterfall!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/uOwg26h.png alt="new passage" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Okay, we&#39;re at the next floor!</p>
<p>Like the first tower, there&#39;s five floors here...</p>
<p>After two more flame orbs are taken care of, a newly freed soul gives more advice on how to proceed forward.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/GsnjXvF.png alt=switches width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I have Ark pick up the Magirock, and go to a pillar with a red button on top.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/wbnVNfA.png alt="button push" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Since there&#39;s a pillar in the east, there must also be one in the west.</p>
<p>I push the western statue to the right, and open the upstairs passage!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/bHSXKoe.png alt=floating width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>A new enemy appears...a floating mage!</p>
<p>I dodge the mage&#39;s crescent beam, and proceed to do business.</p>
<p>For the final blow, I throw a lantern at the mage!</p>
<p>Now I open the doorway to the next floor by pressing the button on the pillar here.</p>
<p>Yikes, spikes here...</p>
<p>Crossing underneath the passageway, we make it to the third floor.</p>
<p>I charge twice at the floating mage nearby.</p>
<p>I press both the buttons on each side of this floor, but nothing&#39;s happened.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/8615rvl.png alt="red jewel again" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Ah, I see. There&#39;s more buttons to push here.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>While pushing the statue, the mage, or a <strong>Cadet</strong>, glares at Ark, and Ark glares back at the mage! This must be another spell that the mage uses. They try to glare at Ark again.</p>
<p>This floating mage is very stubborn!</p>
<p>I manage to clear the floor of enemies and push the last button, revealing a bridge to floor number four!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/zXNTcew.png alt="floor number four passage" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Up the stairs we go...</p>
<p>Now this is a familiar room...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/leuLcGb.png alt="grid of statues" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>In the northwest corner, we get more Magirock!</p>
<p>In the settings menu, I figure out which button to press to guard. Here&#39;s the list...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/YdA7dau.png alt="settings menu" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I might have to change the hotkey on the controller.</p>
<p>The only setting I&#39;ve changed is the text speed.</p>
<p>I practice guarding a few times before scouting around the fourth floor.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/OGmqkqa.png alt="red statue" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I push the nearby statue, and hear a click. Let&#39;s see if I can find other statues like this one...</p>
<p>After pushing the second statue, the door upstairs opens!</p>
<p>Like before, a Guardian awaits, his presence blocking the way to the land control console.</p>
<p>However, it&#39;s not as easy as walking over there this time...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/NOuXXll.png alt="gate lock" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/EjGGGhH.png alt="vase throw" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I meet with the Guardian, who commends me, but does a creepy chuckle. Looks like another challenge is coming...</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>...or not, as he vanishes and lets me through.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/xwpY9b8.png alt="door to console 2" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Hmmm...</p>
<p>The chamber&#39;s the same as before.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/fqDCKkr.png alt="console 2" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The globe descends on top of Ark again, and another continent is born.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/DoirFeb.png alt="new continent 2" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>What&#39;s this continent&#39;s name?</p>
<p>Now that&#39;s unusual...thunder and lightning begin to form, or maybe I didn&#39;t notice that part for the first tower...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/K4lztD8.png alt=rainstorms width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/BjxwJ1m.png alt="south america" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>More villagers&#39; souls have been restored!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/VzQFkmW.png alt="flour mill people unfrozen" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I wonder if we&#39;ll get to visit those continents later in the game?</p>
<p>I enter the fortune teller&#39;s hut, but change my mind and walk around to find the people who have awakened...</p>
<p>The chicken on top of the roof is still spinning along with their neighboring weather vane.</p>
<p>So the people in the flour mill are unfrozen now.</p>
<p>Since we resurrected Eurasia, and South America, I&#39;m guessing there&#39;s North America, Africa, and Australia left...</p>

<p>The cacti that discouraged us from proceeding before mentions the toughness of lions.</p>
<p>I have Ark climb down the vine, now that the danger has lessened somewhat thanks to our deeds.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/YaSuVl9.png alt="vine climbing" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>It seems that it&#39;s a one-way trip down the canyon, huh?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/mt2KptQ.png alt="falling down" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Plus, it&#39;s also a long way down...</p>
<p>Luckily, Ark is pretty sturdy!</p>
<p>West of here is Leim, along with two Peritons!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/puj79Pv.png alt="leim and peritons" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>After taking care of the vultures, we approach Leim, who thanks us. Ark&#39;s worried about Leim.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/deJ5Ovi.png alt="aren't you afraid" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Leim:</strong> &quot;All lions have to pass this test.&quot; Yikes! Poor Leim, though...</p>
<p>Ark decides to follow Leim to leave the canyon. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJnd-xsPjnw">The music begins to change, and here we go!</a></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ccMKdeZ.png alt="leim escort" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We follow Leim as we guard him against nearby swooping Peritons!</p>
<p>And we make it to our first hurdle...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/h7yzebU.png alt="pass the cliff" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I try breaking a nearby boulder covering the cliff face, but for some reason, it will not budge.</p>
<p>I have Ark turn back to find other routes out of the canyon, no good. It takes me a minute to realize there&#39;s an empty space near the boulder, and I decide to push it.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We proceed!</p>
<p>We slowly piton our way up. Leim decides to speed up the way out a bit.</p>
<p>Familiar enemies like the mud monster and orbs of flames await us!</p>
<p>Leim is at an opening on the far end of the next area in the canyon.</p>
<p>I accidentally go way ahead of Leim, and turn back to find him in the same place.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/OvxdPbb.png alt="if tests are this fun" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>At least he&#39;s enjoying the trip...</p>
<p>More enemies await!</p>
<p>Leim heads off to a dead end and heads off to the maze of rocks.</p>
<p>I notice a small stream of water flowing on the cliff face opposite a cactus...</p>
<p>Leim ignores it and moves south.</p>
<p>Now we&#39;re at a fork, I tell Leim that we&#39;ll check where the right way is.</p>
<p>We go east of the fork first, which shows us the way up and out. South fork, not so much.</p>
<p>We go back to Leim and say it&#39;s east.</p>
<p><strong>Leim:</strong> &quot;Wow big guy! You can even foretell the future?&quot; I let him play along with that impression.</p>
<p>Now that we&#39;re near the exit of this area, he compliments the fun of this &quot;test.&quot;</p>
<p>Next area, he&#39;s amazed at the monsters nearby, and follows us to watch us fight them.</p>
<p>He&#39;s in awe at our easy combat with the Peritons.</p>
<p>East of here is a stone bridge, which Leim is excited about, but is it enough to carry all of us forward?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our weight doesn&#39;t support the bridge and Leim falls!</p>
<p>Seeing no way down, we move east...</p>
<p>Next, we climb the nearby cliff face, and at the top we go west...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>...and we reach a dead end!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/X0FOqzx.png alt="dead end" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>It seems that we&#39;re stuck...</p>
<p>Until we go back and jump down from an opening near the other side of the stone bridge!</p>
<p>We make it back to the maze of rocks, and look for Leim back at the shadowy opening of the canyon. He&#39;s not there. We manage to find him back at the open area with the Periton vultures.</p>
<p>We try the stone bridge test again...</p>
<p>We gingerly cross the stone bridge, with us slightly tailing Leim.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/DFtiBDV.png alt="scary thrilling" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Oh yes, indeed!</p>
<p>Leim tells us his growing excitement for this &quot;test,&quot; meaning we passed this area with flying colors.</p>
<p>Next area, Leim&#39;s surprised at the sheer height of the cliff, and so am I.</p>
<p>He decides to make this into a race...</p>
<p>Leim has four paws, so therefore, he wins.</p>
<p>Next area, Leim senses a boss...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ma53Plc.png alt="i sense a monster" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>This should be my &quot;boss is coming up&quot; warning image.</p>
<p>Leim leaps to the other side of the gap, and casually walks away.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Another mud monster greets us...but, we can&#39;t move!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/0WNjrBi.png alt="nice of you to visit" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog>
<strong>Mud Doll:</strong> &quot;I don&#39;t get guests here very often. Let&#39;s party!&quot;</p>
<p>The &quot;party&quot; that this monster wants to partake in is definitely not a friendly one for us...</p>
<p>They start by shooting out mud pellets!</p>
<p>Maybe we should throw them back at the mud doll?</p>
<p>It doesn&#39;t work...how do we reach them?</p>
<p>We can&#39;t escape! Plus, magic rings don&#39;t work here either! I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s because we have a guest party member around...</p>
<p>I see a stray rock and have Ark give the mud doll a return present!</p>
<p>Leim leaves as soon as we pick up the rock...</p>
<p>...only to give us another one! Yes!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/69i3X7C.png alt="use this boulder" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Now we know how to beat this mud doll!</p>
<p>We continue the strategy...</p>
<p>...until the mud doll starts talking again...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/6B8rmSr.png alt="sorry? sure you are" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Oh dear, I don&#39;t like where this is going...</p>
<p><strong>Mud Doll:</strong> &quot;You courageous souls facing the test... It was low of me to try taking advantage of your inexperience. I swear to behave from now on. I&#39;ve got a gift to prove it here.&quot;</p>
<p>The mud doll opens a land bridge to meet them. We fall for their trap, as I expected.</p>
<p>Down into the chasm we go!</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/BgAym7k.png alt="foggy chasm" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Now how do we get out?</p>
<p><strong>Leim:</strong> &quot;<strong>Big guy!!!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>The mud doll lectures Leim on &quot;the pain of betrayals&quot; and spares the prince, saying &quot;that&#39;s what life&#39;s about&quot;. Lucky they don&#39;t know we&#39;re still alive!</p>
<p>Off screen, Leim&#39;s fighting the mud doll!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/z5TfkjM.png alt="one for big guy" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Leim:</strong> &quot;I&#39;m not going to lose to you!&quot; Go Leim!</p>
<p>We hear pellets flying, and claws...</p>
<p>The mud doll is impressed at the lion prince&#39;s fighting spirit!</p>
<p>Now silence....</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Bsvq5tN.png alt=sorry width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The mud doll finally surrenders! Or do they?</p>
<p>I have Ark jump a couple of times, since I really want to take on this monster!</p>
<p><strong>Thud!</strong></p>
<p>Leim jumps down the cliff, reuniting with us!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/kp9Fsre.png alt="youre okay" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>But thanks to my slippery fingers, or the stickiness of the control pad, I accidentally reset the game! I have to take on the escort mission all over again!!!!!</p>
<p>It&#39;s a bit quicker acing it the second time around now that I know what to do, though, Leim gets hurt more from the Peritons.</p>
<p>I still cannot outclimb Leim, even after a head start...</p>
<p><a name=6></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Alright, back to where we left off!</p>
<p><strong>Ark:</strong> &quot;You think Ark will go down that easily?&quot;<br>
<strong>Leim:</strong> &quot;Big guy. I did it. I defeated that monster by myself. I, I feel great. I feel like I have the power to do anything.&quot; Great job, Leim!</p>
<p>Ark points out Leim&#39;s character development, yay!</p>
<p>A sparkle falls down into the chasm near us...Leim wonders if it came from the mud doll. He doubts it though, since it&#39;s a &quot;beautiful stone.&quot;</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/vHpsJTc.png alt="keepsake of test" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Good decision, Ark.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/395GSM4.png alt=starstone width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>So that&#39;s what the stone&#39;s called.</p>
<p>Leim decides to call a gull to take us back. He leaps out of the chasm. It takes a second before we&#39;re out of that canyon...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/DzR7bPM.png alt="gull escort" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We did it!</p>

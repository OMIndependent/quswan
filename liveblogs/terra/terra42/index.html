<p>Okay, time to continue the trek up this cold mountain!</p>
<p>I climb back down an area, as a warmup, to take care of some enemies. I notice a set of vines in the western end of the mountain, at a cliff wall behind a group of tree stumps...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/reuu0f9.png alt="west end of mountain" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Ahead are scattered boulders and two charging Sabredogs!</p>
<p>The boulders can&#39;t be picked up, though.</p>
<p>We climb to higher ground, and I check the map, it seems we&#39;re west of the cave that we didn&#39;t enter yet...</p>
<p>Two more Rakshaki to take care of, and I notice another chest in a small, unreachable opening below...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Wm3xZbW.png alt="valley treasure chest" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>This level has a lot of unreachable treasures...</p>
<p>In the next area is another entrance to a cave.</p>
<p>And we end up sliding down the waterfall!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/6OuEnMb.png alt=waterfall width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Avalanche!!!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/OlOagyb.png alt=avalanche width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I reset the game back to where I left off since I didn&#39;t see what was inside the cave earlier...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Two more gems cross our path, and ahead of them, two Rakshaki, and a Magirock!</p>
<p>We take care of most of them, but the remaining Rakshaki confuses Ark again!</p>
<p>The Raskshaki after lunging their trident a bit too much, gets stuck on the wall temporarily!</p>
<p>We stumble around the cave wall, getting the last Magirock piece at the center of this small tunnel...</p>
<p>I have Ark run out of the cave before the confusion mixes up the movement controls again...</p>
<p>After another match with a Rakshaki at a lower part of the mountain, we go down to the foot of the peak to try to get the treasure...</p>
<p>Before I do, I go back to the mound of tree stumps and head to the southern edge. I notice more Magirock!</p>
<p>While climbing down to the foot of the peak, my controller loses power!</p>
<p>I wait awhile to charge the controller before continuing onwards...</p>
<p>After plugging the controller into the Pi, the controls are now mapped differently!</p>
<p>I take it out, and the controls are back to normal!</p>
<p>After taking care of the Sabredog, I notice a ramp half-hidden by the evergreens, which leads up to the chest on the plateau!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/PouFZ7o.png alt="stardew get" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Now to climb back up...</p>
<p>On the valley below the chest in the western half of the peak, two gems appear!</p>
<p>Another duel with the nearby Rakshaki confuses Ark again!</p>
<p>How can we reach that chest?</p>
<p>There&#39;s no vine to climb up to that valley...</p>
<p>I go back to that area, gaining more XP and money along the way...</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Reading a guide online, it seems that the chest in the valley is impossible to reach at the moment...</p>
<p>Also according to that guide, the crystalline enemies here are called <strong>Ice Crystals</strong>.</p>
<p>Down the cavernous water slide we go!!!</p>
<p>I try to outrun the avalanche the second time around by going into the cave, but nature beats us again!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/nR6wptz.png alt="how much time" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Awaken to find the concerned look of a mountain goat.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>The mountain goat talks to us, stating the obvious: we&#39;re trapped in the cave because of the avalanche. The goat asks us if we can walk. I select the first choice: &quot;No problem.&quot;</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/DyVaLQ4.png alt="not one to give up" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Oh, Ark. The mountain goat likes that answer.</p>
<p>The goat asks us to follow.</p>
<p>Oh god...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/F9apiPe.png alt="the husband goat" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Ark:</strong> &quot;[The second goat] doesn&#39;t appear to be breathing...&quot;</p>
<p>The mountain goat says that the goat is her husband. She explains her short story: they were running up the slopes...</p>
<p>But she moves on pretty quickly, and looks for a way out of the cavern...</p>
<p>We sprint the perimeter of the cavern...</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>It turns dark pretty fast once we make it back to the goat....</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/z8GEiLB.png alt="dark pretty fast" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The goat tells us that we&#39;re cold...</p>
<p><strong>Goat:</strong> &quot;Here comes the night...&quot;</p>
<p>The cave&#39;s now dark, and the goat talks. She asks us if &quot;the [darkness] frightens us.&quot; I put up a brave answer.</p>
<p><strong>Ark:</strong> &quot;I&#39;ve been traveling alone. I may have gotten used to it...&quot;<br>
<strong>Goat:</strong> &quot;All alone...&quot;</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/nv80sa7.png alt="all shun darkness" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We get some rest until daylight comes...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/aiqMJ3h.png alt="so warm" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I don&#39;t know if Ark&#39;s feeling homesick for Crysta Village at this moment...maybe he does...</p>
<p>We hear some rock-crumbling going on...</p>
<p>It seems there might be a way out. The goat asks us if we got woken up by the noise...</p>
<p><strong>Ark:</strong> &quot;Noise that loud will wake anyone!&quot;<br>
<strong>Goat:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s true.&quot;</p>
<p>She asks Ark if he wants breakfast.</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The music from the towers plays again...the goat&#39;s going to have her late husband for breakfast!</p>
<p>Ark&#39;s not happy about the idea...the goat has no problem though...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/933nWIU.png alt=goat width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Ark pauses. He really does not want to do this...</p>
<p>The goat understands, but gives him more advice.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/26azM7C.png alt="be strong" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The mountain goat notices that the wall is thinner on the north end of the cave. She decides to ram the wall!</p>
<p>After a few attempts, she makes it!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Bl4DEq1.png alt="way out" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We&#39;re free!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/k8QEy7J.png alt="crystal wall" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog>
Or not...</p>
<p>The goat gives up...then says that Ark can climb this crystal wall out.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/VIYaKKB.png alt="there will be walls to climb" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I&#39;m guessing she means not just the literal kind of wall either.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/GxW8R6U.png alt="but you mustn't give up" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Goat:</strong> &quot;I will get out of here myself one way or another. You have to persevere. Now go. You must continue your journey.&quot;</p>
<p>We scale the wall, and we&#39;re back at the foot of the mountain!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/baqLfBQ.png alt="back outside" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><a name=6></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Luckily the way to the Stardew chest is still accessible. Missable items are never a good sign, imo.</p>
<p>Ice Crystals bar the way up...</p>
<p>Let&#39;s see if anything&#39;s changed since that avalanche...</p>
<p>It has! The valley is now filled with so much snow that we can reach the unopened chest!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/qbLQmoa.png alt="treasure chest reachable" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We win a <strong>Life Potion</strong> from there (another max life boost), and check for any more changes...</p>
<p>I have Ark use it up quickly, along with the Luck Potion!</p>
<p>I have a feeling that the mountain goat from earlier was testing Ark, in a way.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/c0XASY1.png alt="boulders block" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Back down the mountain now, since there&#39;s no way back up...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/zqjJTh7.png alt="avalanche snow lake" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Ark states the avalanche snow must have filled the water completely...</p>
<p>We circle around the vast snow-covered lake, taking care of more Sabredogs...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/avkipnq.png alt="vast lake of snow" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I have Ark sprint to the western end of the lake...nothing there.</p>
<p>Ark accidentally falls into the chasm nearby, losing a Zelda heart&#39;s worth of damage!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/U9JQhE5.png alt="long climb" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Now that&#39;s a long climb!</p>
<p><a name=7></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The map of Eklemata&#39;s changed once again, there&#39;s seven floors total!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/mby6p4u.png alt="new map" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We go inside the cave, which looks more darker than the previous caves.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/gNKLdCX.png alt="darker cave" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We tail around and climb down to get the <strong>Stardew</strong> from the chest, and climb back up to cover the western end of the cave.</p>
<p>No path forward there, but we grab more money from another chest...</p>
<p>We climb back down again, climb up some more, and climb more stairs...so much climbing!</p>
<p>A duo of Slimes greet us at the top...</p>
<p>Outside the cave, Sabredogs!</p>
<p>The power from my controller is out again! I wait awhile to charge my controller before continuing...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/5jXixoq.png alt=waiting width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>This mountain is one long trek! At least, thank goodness, this dungeon is not the Ancient Shrine or the Lake Shrine! It&#39;s long but not difficult...</p>
<p>Climbing more vines, and tricky Rakshaki await us!</p>
<p>We claim a Magirock at the foot of the nearby field...</p>
<p><a name=8></a></p>
<hr>
<p>At the end of our trek is another hole to jump into...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/qmi5MXY.png alt="big hole" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Sensing that there&#39;s going to be a boss battle soon, I make the decision to go back down the mountain since I&#39;m low on healing supplies.</p>
<p>We jump down the chasm!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/gqvcwAR.png alt="another cave" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>And another!</p>
<p>We continue traversing the cave and take care of more Ice Crystals and Slimes along the way!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/xCraG24.png alt="cave exit" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>This tunnel, I&#39;m guessing, is the way to the summit, and where the boss for this area, is going to be...</p>
<p>There&#39;s still a bit of more mountain to climb...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/cM7quFa.png alt="way to summit" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Here we go!</p>
<p><a name=9></a></p>
<hr>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/vJbK5H3.png alt="boss fight" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The slenderman, at the dais of the summit, transforms into a Yeti!</p>
<p>The boss&#39;s first salvo is a block of sharp ice, and a blizzard!!!</p>
<p>I try my best efforts to break the ice, but the blizzard ends up charting the course for us...</p>
<p>The shadowy slenderman changes back, and the scene fades to black...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/xkhnphw.png alt="high cadet mage" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>What&#39;s a High Cadet Mage doing here?</p>
<p>We manage to get one hit in, before the High Cadet Mage floats across the summit super fast...</p>
<p>Airborne attacks are the only way the High Cadet Mage can be affected, I think?</p>
<p>I try using up some Rings, but this fight doesn&#39;t allow them!</p>
<p>I realize that the High Cadet Mage can only be hit by its own spells!</p>
<p>So this is going to be a tennis match...</p>
<p>And the Cadet Mage is down!</p>
<p>Now the slenderman faces us!</p>
<p>He transforms into a group of invulnerable bats!</p>
<p>After another hit, he changes back to a flurry of bats again!</p>
<p>Two more turns like this, and the small fireworks display begins!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ihSLDQI.png alt="dark morph" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I&#39;ll still call him slenderman, though.</p>
<p>The same omnipotent voice speaks to us again...</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Ark.</strong> <strong><em>The day has come for the resurrection of humans.</em></strong> <strong>Humans are wonderful animals with the ability to create technology. But they have no idea of the vast power they wield.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/S3jz3UK.png alt="you must lead" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Now the final cutscene begins: The Resurrection of the Humans.</p>
<p><a name=10></a></p>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47WRHtOSwSs">This music gives me the chills.</a></p>
<p>A fallen Ark fades to black...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/NsGlSlT.png alt="ark fallen" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>A flower blooms...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/YlBxQ5b.png alt="flower blooms" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Now a yak eats the flower.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/9i6647W.png alt="yak and flower" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>And a Kingbird swoops down on the yak...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/BcqO4TS.png alt=kingbird width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>A baby Kingbird hatches from an egg...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/LZM894G.png alt="kingbird and child" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>A Huball gets the Kingbird and their offspring...</p>
<p>Ark back again...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/8ZBiOK2.png alt="ark again" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>He falls...</p>
<p>Fade to black. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8_sfFLvWZ4">The birth music plays again</a>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> I accidentally reset my session twice during the resurrection cutscene by accident!! It still doesn&#39;t change the fact that I get chills listening to that music...</p>

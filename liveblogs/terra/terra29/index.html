<p>As I&#39;m getting ready for my last session before I go into hiatus, I&#39;d like to thank everyone who&#39;s been following my liveblogs so far!</p>
<p>Back to that Grecliff, where I think I noticed another tunnel in... but it&#39;s only a dead end.</p>
<p>This bird enemy is super quick!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/SouYN4c.png alt="bird enemy" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>There we go!</p>
<p>Now outside at the second floor of the cliff, I try to find other passages I haven&#39;t reached last time...</p>
<p>I get the drop on the Quaker this time by having Ark make a diving charge at another stone creature before he lands!</p>
<p>Climbing up to another floor now. After a few failed attempts, we make a leaping charge past the chasm!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/nVKU5gJ.png alt="other side of chasm" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>After another diving charge past another chasm, we finally make it! I celebrate a bit by having Ark swim at the watering hole here.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/oGFOMUm.png alt="watering hole" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Outside, there&#39;s another chest on the west side of the cliff, but the gap is too wide for us to reach.</p>
<p>Eastward, there&#39;s more vines to climb. I&#39;m expecting mudmen here too...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Miraculously, no mudmen appear, and we find another Magirock at the north end of the cliff.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/uIWF0L2.png alt="tunnel nearby" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Inside the tunnel south and west from there, we come across more boulders blocking our path...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/1eNh4T6.png alt=boulders width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Not a problem, as Ark destroys them easily with the new spear!</p>
<p>Past another flight of steps down, we&#39;re back outside, where a mudman and more swoopers wait for us.</p>
<p>As we leap up the short cliffs, we take care of one swooper bird with a diving save.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/RtpEwgW.png alt="cliff steps" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>In the next area, and I notice these small men there. Are they friend or foe?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/WhdDopO.png alt="small fighters" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>It looks like they&#39;re foes, as they start performing martial arts and rolling at us!</p>
<p>There are now two sets of vines for us to climb, and I take the southernmost set, leading us to another set of Magirock. But, it&#39;s guarded by a mudman.</p>
<p>We pass him, and go east, which is a dead end.</p>
<p>We go back up and take the vines going inside a hole. The vines though, are very short.</p>
<p>We fall a long way down!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/nG0kj9j.png alt="long way down" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>And we&#39;re back outside, at the place where we found a Magirock.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We climb back up again.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/aJ0L0YY.png alt="vines or hole" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>What to do, what to do?</p>
<p>Falling in, I steer Ark in a fork going to the left...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/2eADtHD.png alt="to the left" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>...and we end up at the unreachable chest!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/CRdJw8U.png alt="unreachable chest" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We climb the set of vines west of the chest, tumbling us down to another undiscovered part of the cliffs. The place is infested with more living mud puddles!</p>
<p>East is a dead end, and west leads us to a bridge over to the next cliff.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/JGixFaU.png alt=horizon width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/4byNUfK.png alt="tunnel second cliff" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Inside a tunnel in the second cliff, small leaping mini-stone heads fire small fireballs at us!</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I give up and have Ark sprint away from them, and find more Magirock!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/au60OQU.png alt=fireballs width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>On the other side of the large passage, we climb another set of steps into more of those falling platforms!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/qmcXfIu.png alt="upstairs falling platforms" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We make a sprint for it, which doesn&#39;t cause the platforms to fall. I realize they&#39;re not falling because of the Quaker head on the other side didn&#39;t jump...</p>
<p>The rest of the room has more of those large stone heads!</p>
<p>I have Ark sprint and quickly take care of them as we go.</p>
<p>We did it!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/qe4kGBJ.png alt="falling platforms end" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Unfortunately, our small celebration is short-lived as more swoopers come to roost on Ark!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/5bBQhDu.png alt="birds nest" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>So we&#39;re now at their giant nest, huh?</p>
<p>We noticed a sparkling thing in the nest, and pick it up.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/d3J1gPI.png alt="sharp claws" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Now we can climb those reliefs in the cliffs! Gur pynjf&#39; hfr vf fvzvyne gb gur cvgbaf va gur svany <strong>Hapunegrq</strong> tnzr.</p>
<p>I also learn that the swooper birds here are called <strong>Periton</strong>s.</p>
<p>I test the Claws out on some of the cliff faces we&#39;ve seen.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ivUrlup.png alt="climbing cliffs" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Now that&#39;s a lovely horizon...</p>
<p>I have Ark climb up the long cliff, reaching a tunnel. From the map, we&#39;re now in the large part of the fifth floor.</p>
<p>We run into more old enemies such as the Peritons, and Quaker stone heads.</p>
<p>Up another cliff, we meet more of those small rolypoly people, and find more money and a Magirock!</p>
<p>More rumblin&#39; and tumblin&#39;!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/CWv9Op5.png alt="rumble tumble" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>At our landing spot, I notice another Magirock, but the vine to get up there is too short and too far to reach!</p>
<p>I have Ark go west...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/k8epBTO.png alt="vine climb" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Dangit, we&#39;re almost low on health! After some healing, I check up on the description of the Sharp Claws.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/36WU1R6.png alt="sharp claw description" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Westward, we&#39;re back at the entrance, but on the top cliff this time!</p>
<p>We reach more unreachable loot as well!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/twEgh7b.png alt="life potion" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I leave the Grecliff, or as it should be called, the Great Cliffs, and do some R&amp;R for a bit.</p>
<p>While I&#39;m writing this, I forget to pause the game, as a stone creature attacks Ark!!</p>

<p><a name=1></a></p>
<p>Going back to the northwest house, a girl mentions her new dream.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/8dZVvty.png alt="dream about ark" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><strong>Girl:</strong> &quot;...somewhere I never ever seen. Isn&#39;t it nice?&quot;</p>
<p>The mother and the son say the same things before they got frozen.</p>
<p>I go back to the Elder&#39;s house and have Ark sleep before saving again.</p>
<p>Fourth tower, here we come...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/PcsC6YS.png alt="fourth tower" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The fourth tower&#39;s outside is similar to the other three...except the face on the gate is placed higher now...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/2VvJ97A.png alt=candyland width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Did I step into Candyland?</p>
<p>And this is a bit of a surprise!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/oAiZzWp.png alt="guardian at entrance" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The Guardian chuckles at us again. What do you have in store this time?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/HiFHqdI.png alt="three cadets" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Here we go again!</p>
<p>Lucky it&#39;s three Cadet mages instead of one mage and two illusions!</p>
<p>After they&#39;re gone, the spikes on both ends of the floor lower, opening a huge gap! The tightropes there are the only ways of crossing the chasm.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Let&#39;s see how Ark does here...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/nGUzFeB.png alt="tightrope walking yay" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>That was close. I&#39;m guessing Ark might&#39;ve walked on some clotheslines when he was younger as practice. The villagers weren&#39;t too happy, though.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/VDkcwrT.png alt="drapes blowing" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The detailed animation of the hanging drapes blowing looks nice. No wonder why this game is good.</p>
<p>The interior of the tower might be at home with the mages here.</p>
<p>After taking care of another Cadet mage, we free a <strong>soul:</strong> &quot;<strong>Your courage is at test. At times, you must take bold chances.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>The tightrope might be one of those tests...</p>
<p>I realize that I have to let Ark fall into the huge abyss here.</p>
<p>And we make it to the basement!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/AdbBz4t.png alt=basement width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>A Guardner tried to kick us out, but since Ark was wearing the Seal, it doesn&#39;t work!</p>
<p>More Cadet mages notice us, and prepare their spells!</p>
<p>Checking the map, there are 2 basement floors and 3 main floors for this tower.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/qkfrDkH.png alt="map sample fourth tower" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Ark&#39;s now causing more damage to the mages!</p>
<p>The only way forward here is to go down...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/hqOlqJ6.png alt="only way is down" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I clear the second floor basement full of enemies.</p>
<p>Are Guardners usually invincible?</p>
<p>Upstairs, I get more money from a chest, and a Magirock.</p>
<p>After two more flights of stairs, and taking on more enemies, Ark falls while trying to get a foothold on the tightrope.</p>
<p>Back to square, or floor, one!</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>This time, I have Ark fall on to the southeast hole in first floor basement, where we end up in another part of the tower.</p>
<p>Through this path, we get a one way ticket to the top, or...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/mKPrhaE.png alt="hole down" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I decide to have Ark jump down the hole and go another way. There&#39;s some items here I haven&#39;t gotten yet.</p>
<p>Unlike the other Quintet games I&#39;ve played, the enemies regenerate for each floor.</p>
<p>I manage to pick up more Magirock on the second floor.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/HMPKvQr.png alt="more magirock" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/gzaAfLd.png alt="more tightrope" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>And after crossing the tightrope and meeting more enemies, our rewards await!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/bXW6blS.png alt=rewards width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We win a <strong>medium bulb of garlic</strong> in the first chest, and a <strong>Life Potion</strong> in the second.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/xiNX3lP.png alt="life potion" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I wonder, is a Life Potion the game&#39;s equivalent of a Wonder Essence or a Fairy? No, I realize that it&#39;s a Heart Container! I use it immediately.</p>
<p>I have Ark walk the long tightrope to go back to the stairway.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/5mCb4D2.png alt="made it" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>We made it!</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Now we&#39;re at the top floor...</p>
<p>More enemies, very little time!</p>
<p>At the northwest passage, I pick up something from a chest that might help Elle with her weaving...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/xh6SUv6.png alt="crystal thread yes" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Lucky for this hole, at least it doesn&#39;t throw us back to the first floor...</p>
<p>I have Ark continue tightroping.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Oq81LKo.png alt="console door" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>How could we open that door?</p>
<p>The Guardian calls to us as we step forward.</p>
<p><strong>Guardian:</strong> &quot;I have prepared a most entertaining show for you. Savor it. Enjoy.&quot; Oh boy...</p>

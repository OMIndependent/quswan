<p>Here we are, at <strong>Grecliff</strong>, or the place where the birds are sleeping.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/R3pU6pK.png alt=grecliff width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The red landscape looks ominous, but it looks so nice.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/VOURgUp.png alt="cave entrance" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Inside the cave now, where we see a stone creature walking around at the north end.</p>
<p>The creature&#39;s a hard hitter, and hard to hit!</p>
<p>I have Ark use a repeated rush at the stone being.</p>
<p>I take caution after awhile, and proceed to take care of them slowly.</p>
<p>Eastward, another stone creature and a swooping bird strike!</p>
<p>I have Ark jump the short cliffs, and head upstairs...</p>
<p>Looking at the map, it seems we have a long way to go...there&#39;s two cliffs here. 5 floors on the first cliff, and 2 floors on the second.</p>
<p>I pass by another stone creature, and have Ark push a boulder to get thru. Near the second boulder, we pick up some small boulders and throw them at the creature.</p>
<p>After they&#39;re gone, I have Ark push the second boulder, which turns out to have another stone creature hiding in there! Oh my goodness, game...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/XPreEFL.png alt="boulder shakes" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I escape...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>There&#39;s also a mudman here too, and the mud that he slings is like quicksand. Ark&#39;s staff or magic have no effect on him...</p>
<p>I go to the next tunnel in the cliff, and pass the stone creatures.</p>
<p>The birds here are slightly tough to take out, since they keep flying over Ark, and move out of range.</p>
<p>Higher up, we go inside and get another boost potion!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/pHxXEdo.png alt="str boost" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Back at the cavern river full of birds, we climb to the next floor in the cliff...</p>
<p>Past the entrance, we&#39;re treated to another surprise!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/muMFZBX.png alt=quaker width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>The Quaker jumps again, freezing Ark because of the shockwave from his jump!</p>
<p>We climb two sets of stairs, and circle around the area until we make it back outside the cliff...</p>
<p>We climb more vines and pass another invincible mudman before going back in. Are mudmen really indestructible in this game?</p>
<p>Two stone creatures get the drop on us, and we pass through them (taking lots of injuries) in order to get what&#39;s in the chest.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/UOYtH9r.png alt=rocspear width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>Let&#39;s hope this weapon will make things a bit easier around here...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/hay8S1k.png alt="boulder fall" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>...and a boulder falls, blocking our exit!</p>
<p>I equip the Rock Spear and shatter the large boulder, along with the two rock creatures!</p>
<p>Now we&#39;re getting somewhere!</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I noticed a bunch of holes and reliefs on some of the faces of the cliff...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/LItj0H3.png alt="holes in cliff" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I think we might need something to climb that rock face.</p>
<p>West of where we came from has those same holes.</p>
<p>We go back and climb more stairs, where Ark levels up after taking care of another swooper!</p>
<p>Looks like we&#39;ll have to fall in...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/3V73a97.png alt="big hole" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>...or not.</p>
<p>With nowhere to go, we turn back. The enemies in this area are now more easier to take care of with this new spear.</p>
<p>Now how to reach that treasure chest in the corner?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/pzrY7kN.png alt="how to reach chest" width=360 height=270 id=liveblog></p>
<p>I take care of more stone creatures to relieve my frustrations of this mountain from earlier.</p>
<p>At least they drop a lot of money...</p>
<p>We return to the empty bird sanctuary, buy some more bulbs, and save at this point.</p>

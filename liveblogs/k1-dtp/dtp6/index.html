<p>Last session, I forgot to bring up how many friends we rescued so far...here they are.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/2OvblKY.png alt="new friends" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>As a warmup, I take on yesterday&#39;s level.</p>
<p>I mess up on the boss rematch and the dream sprite challenge with the rolling spike balls, though.</p>
<p>The big leaf lifts us up to a higher part of the forest...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/74QDwSV.png alt="vision start" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>The forest is growing back thanks to our efforts in Jugpot...</p>
<p>A new gameplay element is introduced here: the trampoline.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/XTrOJq7.png alt=trampoline id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>As I said before, timing is important, and trampolines emphasize that. I&#39;m more or less telling myself this as a memo.</p>
<p>Boxes are here too, huh?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/IX1qoH0.png alt=boxes id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>An ambush! Moos and their armored counterparts await us! The Armored Moos have creepy, cute grins painted on their armor.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s see if the old tricks to take care of them work...</p>
<p>And they do!</p>
<p>We make it to a small hut, where a forest local is tied up...</p>
<p>As Klonoa is untying the ropes, the local calls Klonoa &quot;not one of the bad ones.&quot; Klonoa introduces himself. It makes me wonder, do all the other kingdoms keep to themselves?</p>
<p>The guard gets to his feet. Klonoa jumps in surprise.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/vgqpxYD.png alt="gondola guard" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>Oh Klonoa...</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Meanwhile, above the trees, Joka is not pleased. Keep being annoyed at Klonoa, Joka, because we won&#39;t stop.</p>
<p>Now Joka starts a game: flying Moo keep-away. The item he&#39;s keeping away is the key in this level.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/4eNgJCB.png alt="flying moo and joka" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>The Moos are cute, but they do have a sense of soullessness to them.</p>
<p>Back at the hut, the guard warns us it&#39;s a &quot;long trip ahead.&quot;</p>
<p>He&#39;s not wrong, as we meet a spike ball spitter, and a new Moo variation.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/W2cWtKz.png alt="trampoline moo" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>As soon as we get to the higher floor, we lost a life!</p>
<p>We use a gondola to make it to the hut in the background, but I change my mind, thinking there&#39;s nothing there, and go west.</p>
<p>I see an egg floating on one of the thickets in the hut behind us...</p>
<p>We rescue a friend, and double back to the large hut, surrounded by blue Moos in grinning armor.</p>
<p>We break the egg, and get a key!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/hUeek1X.png alt="key get" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>So much for Joka&#39;s keep-away game!</p>
<p>We rescue our second friend after breaking a box.</p>
<p>I try breaking more boxes lodged on a tree in the background, where the enemies I use end up phasing through the tree.</p>
<p>Now to the other side, where trampoline Moos and a trio of armors await.</p>
<p>We break the supporting box, and the top box lands!</p>
<p>We double back around, and get another key from the box!</p>
<p>This is probably going to be called the key-and-gondola level, if this keeps up.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Zp8WwL7.png alt="key open" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Now to another area...</p>
<p>I go down into a small pit, and keep getting hit by rollers! I use one to open up a flower...</p>
<p>And it&#39;s holding an egg!</p>
<p>The rolling rollers cost Klonoa another life!</p>
<p>As I expected, our fourth friend is in that egg.</p>
<p>After losing another life, and almost a third, we rescue that friend, and get out of the rollers&#39; pit to proceed to the trampoline pillars.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/mS6McCa.png alt="big armor moomoo" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>That&#39;s a big armored Moomoo!</p>
<p>I shed its armor, but since there&#39;s no enemies nearby to use, I go west.</p>
<p>I was thinking I was reaching a dead end, but it seems I&#39;m entering frustration land.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/oa8jrqW.png alt="tree hole jump" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>Picking up enemies when Klonoa is standing on a trampoline is a careful operation. Otherwise, I end up making Klonoa double jump if the timing is wrong.</p>
<p>We finally break a Moo&#39;s armor, and break a box, and head down the gap, where a closed flower is.</p>
<p>Thanks to a nearby Moo spawning, we get an extra life!</p>

<p>I almost read Coronia as Corona.</p>
<p>I accidentally spoiled myself in that there are 72 friends that need rescuing. I&#39;ve rescued 54 friends already, so counting this level, there&#39;s three more levels to go.</p>
<p>Now we&#39;re in the thick of it...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/1A613iT.png alt="vision start" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>The first sight Klonoa sees is a wounded priest!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/22rkw5r.png alt="wounded priest" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>The priest says he &quot;was ambushed.&quot; Oh no...</p>
<p>Klonoa asks him who he is.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/lf9VyJ3.png alt=moire id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>The priest introduces himself as Moire the High Priest.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we&#39;re too late. Ghadius has opened the gateway...</p>
<p><strong>Moire</strong>: &quot;The kingdom of legend will return soon.&quot;<br>
<strong>Klonoa</strong>: &quot;That can&#39;t be!&quot;<br>
<strong>Moire</strong>: &quot;<strong>The Moon Kingdom Cress gathers up dream power...and gives shape to Phantomile.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Moire</strong>: &quot;That is, everything you see around you...Ghadius wants to replace that dream with nightmares...and set loose evil unto the world.&quot;</p>
<p>Klonoa shuts his eyes, saddened.</p>
<p>Huepow&#39;s not backing down, though.</p>
<p><strong>Huepow</strong>: &quot;Even if the Moon Kingdom appears, we can still stop Ghadius!&quot;</p>
<p>Klonoa is emboldened by his words. Moire&#39;s not so sure.</p>
<p>The priest then gives us his blessing and warns us that &quot;the eclipse gives power to evil ones,&quot; and while light exists, we should use that to our advantage.</p>
<p>What does he mean by that?</p>
<p>Klonoa repeats Moire&#39;s words.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>When we head outside, the darkness comes, and platforms appear. So do the nightmare creatures...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/wE7wXOv.png alt="darkness comes" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>As long as the darkness is there, the creatures are invincible. But it&#39;s temporary, as light returns to the temple later.</p>
<p>Getting to the other side of this ledge is tricky...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/fvpBsdx.png alt="ledge w fire spout" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>By using the switches, we can toggle the in-out pillars here.</p>
<p>So many multiple paths. I go west, there&#39;s trampolines. East, tunnels.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/itACrNz.png alt="many tunnels" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>We walk to the tunnel outside, observe, and go back.</p>
<p>The trampolines get us back to the higher alcove.</p>
<p>We collect the heart and drop down onto the in-out platform.</p>
<p>Knowing there&#39;s a second friend to be rescued, we go to the middle tunnel.</p>
<p>Back in and out using the east path, we lose a life thanks to an invincible nightmare Moo.</p>
<p>I have to remember, as long as there is daylight, the creatures are not immune.</p>
<p>We make it the top of the stairs!</p>
<p>We leap onto the platforms when the darkness appears.</p>
<p>Seeing a friend in a bubble, we use a flying Moo to cross the wide gap with a fire spout filling the gap.</p>
<p>Inside another light beam elevator...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/L4GEVXP.png alt="elevator two" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>

<p>I nearly succeeded in a dream sprite challenge, though I&#39;m relieved I got an extra life. Unfortunately, we end up losing it because of the invincible nightmare creatures and the fire-breathing exhausts...</p>
<p>...and Klonoa&#39;s almost out of health again!</p>
<p>Instead of using the platform to go inwards where the armored Moos are, we head east and get our health restored!</p>
<p>We see another bubble where a fourth friend is. I wait for the light to fade...</p>
<p>...and then rescue him!</p>
<p>Back inside the temple again...another life gone!</p>
<p>We go west and use a Glibz to activate a switch that pushes the pillars in.</p>
<p>Outside, we rescue a fifth friend, and back in again!</p>
<p>We crisscross through the mini-maze, using the creatures nearby, and rescue the last friend in this level!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/TSXZ02j.png alt="rescue last friend" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>We cross the metal platform in the middle of the mini-maze to make our getaway!</p>
<p>The devs are aware that this is a tough level, being generous with the golden hearts.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/SJ1JSWB.png alt="dark creature" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>As soon as the light shows up, we take one of the swoopers and throw it to the switch!</p>
<p>I push the pillar back once we reach the other side...</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>It&#39;s close, but we make it to the next elevator room!</p>
<p>Looks like there&#39;s more adventure left...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/6v4qXgv.png alt="more tunnels" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>If that&#39;s the way to Ghadius and Joka, then we need to find a way to get up there.</p>
<p>We&#39;re near the top of the temple, and we have to open these switches to free a Moo.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/VqFA9wR.png alt="caged moo" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>There&#39;s around four or five of them to activate. We already got two in so far.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/X7KDwuu.png alt="switches around" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>We did it! It turns out I have to use the Moo as a boost jump inside the elevator room.</p>
<p>Klonoa lands on a platform that leads us to the entrance to the boss room...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/te1RJIk.png alt="entrance to elevator four" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>Or the elevator up to Ghadius and Joka.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Cpnp6CJ.png alt="lift on the way" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>We reach the top of the temple!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/w0OGtIL.png alt="where are we?" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Oh no, Ghadius!</p>
<p>Ghadius turns to Joka...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/vHncJlN.png alt=explain id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>Joka tries to explain himself, but from experience, I know what kind of a villain Ghadius is.</p>
<p>Or not, as Ghadius ignores Joka.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/qHo9lWf.png alt="what are you planning?" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>Ghadius desires &quot;simple revenge&quot; for being trapped for 3 millennia.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/m4KrTGT.png alt="ghadius monologue" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p><strong>Ghadius</strong>: &quot;Well, I&#39;ll plunge all of you and your world into a sea of nightmares!&quot;</p>
<p>He opens his cape...revealing Lephise!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/uL1uEij.png alt="open cape" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>Ghadius announces his plan to hatch his &quot;egg of destruction&quot; onto the world, and vanishes!</p>
<p>Klonoa and Huepow decide to chase after him!</p>
<p>Joka stops them, his voice now distorted...</p>
<p>That clown mask is still angry at us for beating him not once, not twice, not thrice, but four times!</p>
<p>He grows into a giant and the floor panels rise to the sky!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/JWA6UhJ.png alt="joka boss" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p><a name=boss></a></p>
<hr>
<p></p><h2 class=entry-title>Boss: Joka</h2><p></p>

<p>He bows...</p>
<p>And the fight is on!</p>
<p>What is he planning to do?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/PtKSbGT.png alt="joka walks" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>He casually walks, while his fists rotate around him like rotating shields!</p>
<p>One hit barely made a mark on his health.</p>
<p>Three hits and the darkness returns...</p>
<p>He summons wisps to him...and transforms!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/LfT1wDz.png alt=transformation id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>The Moos have turned into nightmares, unable to be caught, while Joka starts swinging his scythe-like arms!</p>
<p>I figure out that we need to turn the floors yellow by walking over them, turning dark into light, metaphorically.</p>
<p>As soon as we do that, the light comes back, and Joka turns back into his usual self!</p>
<p>Joka&#39;s walking a bit faster this time, and more randomly.</p>
<p>Knowing the pattern of when he&#39;s going to transform, we hit him thrice.</p>
<p>Purple panels make this harder now, so does a sweeping attack circling the whole arena!</p>
<p>Back to light, Joka&#39;s jumping this time.</p>
<p>The darkness comes once more.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/2qBWqIr.png alt="sweeping attack" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>Miraculously, we change him back again!</p>
<p>No hits were made, his defense is rock solid.</p>
<p>Here we go again...</p>
<p>Two lives spent later, on the eighth hit, we finally take care of Joka!</p>
<p>That was for Grandpa!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/PXPHjd3.png alt="vision clear" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>The arena descends down to earth.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/MprJvqK.png alt="joka done" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p><strong>Joka</strong>: &quot;Shamed. Defeated. Dishonored. <strong>But...the time has come. Listen well. The sound of the Moon Kingdom&#39;s return. You&#39;ll end up in darkness, in a nightmare...In a world of nothingness...Agh, my Ghadius!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Joka blows up!</p>
<p><a name=6></a></p>
<hr>
<p>I&#39;m treated to a cutscene.</p>
<p>The crystal in the middle, the barrier sealing the Moon Kingdom, is shattered.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/TwbT6qT.png alt="crystal shines" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>A beam of light drops down.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ndqE2pZ.png alt="beam of light" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>The light splits into three, one per Kingdom: Jugpot, Forlock, and Breezegale. </p>
<p>They end up hitting the center of their large wheels, and rebound to the center of the kingdoms.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Atvjudu.png alt=center id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>A brief silence.</p>
<p>The Moon Kingdom rises from the ground!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/52YZu6o.png alt="moon kingdom rises" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>It&#39;s quite a beautiful palace.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/z7wb8uw.png alt="moon kingdom rises 2" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p><strong>Huepow</strong>: &quot;Nightmare energy is being spread around the world.&quot;</p>
<p>Klonoa bares his fangs in fury. It&#39;s Klonorbin&#39; time!</p>
<p>Pamela swoops in, and tells Klonoa to jump on! Yes, we&#39;re going up there!!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/fBUOkBI.png alt="up to the moon kingdom" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>Even the storybook reveals the Moon Kingdom too.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/EuDqCiI.png alt="end screen" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>The fireworks are more numerous now!</p>
<p>Next session, we enter the Moon Kingdom.</p>

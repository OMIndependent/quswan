<p>The ring that we&#39;re in is similar to being in a hamster wheel instead of a circular arena like last time.</p>
<p>So if we shoot the circling warps, it leads us outside of the ring!</p>
<p>He shoots a beam of blue onto the ring!</p>
<p>We warp out of there immediately!</p>
<p>Inside the ring, he summons eyeless Death Moos, and after looking them up off-session, they are super nightmarish to look at, as they have no eyes and sharp teeth!</p>
<p>He also launches fanged, flaming orbs!</p>
<p>After observing his attack patterns in and out of the ring, we get a hit on him! So it&#39;s not the mask but his cape we have to hit!</p>
<p>We manage to succeed on take two! At half-health, Ghadius now makes triples of his mask!</p>
<p>He rematerializes his mask and summons bumper car-like beings (it&#39;s the only way I can describe it) with Death Moos and portals in tow! They&#39;re now flying about the ring!</p>
<p>After two hits, he switches up his strategy...</p>
<p>He conjures up a triangle barrier with Death Moos inside!</p>
<p>After breaking one of the bumpers, we get him with another of his Death Moos!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he summons another one with a portal as a third bumper!</p>
<p>And the last one!</p>

<p>His unsettling, amplified scream echoes as his cape disintegrates and the fireworks explode on him!</p>
<p>Now <strong>that</strong> was for Grandpa!</p>
<p>In other news, we got everybody, and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gss1es9qLdE">Thank You Song</a> is played in full.</p>

<p>Next session, we wrap up <strong>Klonoa: Door to Phantomile</strong> once and for all!</p>
<p>Oh my god, this level was definitely one of the hardest! The devs gave it their all on this one! Fitting that it&#39;s also the last platforming level of this game!</p>
<p>I will admit, though, that if I were younger, Ghadius&#39;s voice would have been terrifying to hear, especially when the lowness of it scratches and nearly breaks the audio.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1aADI-G6uU">Here is the music for the boss fight with Ghadius, the title for it fits so well for the arena we were placed into</a>.</p>

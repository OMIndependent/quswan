<p>Klonoa tells Pamela to stop at the base of the entrance.</p>
<p>And as before, he thanks her for the ride.</p>
<p>And also as before, Pamela tells Klonoa to be careful.</p>
<p>Now this is something new: a brooding Huepow. Klonoa asks what&#39;s wrong.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/TAqZ2yA.png alt="huepow brooding" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>Huepow denies anything&#39;s wrong, and says that we have to stop Ghadius first.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/2IkLscI.png alt=entranceway id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>We enter the Moon Kingdom proper.</p>
<p>It&#39;s quite a place!</p>
<p>I&#39;m a bit worried there might be an endless pit somewhere in this room, that&#39;s why I&#39;m treading carefully here.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/mHefKv5.png alt="bridge to atrium" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>I wonder what these glowing statues are here for? I&#39;m guessing there&#39;s a certain creature we might need to catch to break them.</p>
<p>In the west passage, we see an electrified floor below. I wait for a drum platform to drop in.</p>
<p>The stakes are getting high, as I slip repeatedly, either by touching the floor, or by a Moo, and Klonoa loses a life! We did manage to rescue one friend before starting back at the start of the passage.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-W9RG4LvL0E">Some parts of the music sound familiar...</a></p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We do a better job this time.</p>
<p>We make it past the electrified platform, and end up in the background. We rescue a second friend too.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/5kIFHOb.png alt="red crystal" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>After shattering the shining red crystal, the statue in front of it turns to dust.</p>
<p>Now I remember why the music sounded so familiar, some parts of it are taken from the opening.</p>
<p>We float jump to the alcove to the east part of the atrium. Going further east, we run into a blue statue blocking the way.</p>
<p>Into the big passageway we go...</p>
<p>We&#39;re outside, Klonoa standing on a glittering perch of stars...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/dGKOJX9.png alt="stardust balcony" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>With each step, stardust drops from the floor into the aether.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a green statue to take care of too.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/zksQorO.png alt="green statue" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>We return to the atrium and enter into a room full of Ghosts. Lots of them.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a linear path from here to the next room.</p>
<p>We take the floating platform up, and take all that&#39;s here, including rescuing a third friend.</p>
<p>We jump onto more floating platforms, and for some reason, their edges seem to wobble, like it might topple over if we&#39;re not careful. Ghosts join in on the fun of wanting to push us down into the endless pit.</p>
<p>I miss a few dream stones, oh well.</p>
<p>We break the blue crystal, dissolving the blue statues into powder.</p>
<p><a name=3></a></p>
<hr>
<p>We go outside to the perch and enter the blue statue doorway.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a few yellow statues here, so we take a detour below. In the next room, a bunch of Boomies are walking about in the area below!</p>
<p>Another life gone from a spikey, but we breeze through the room!</p>
<p>Only to fall twice in the next room!</p>
<p>This is the Lake Shrine of this game, or almost close to it.</p>
<p>I manage to get our fourth friend and avoid falling the third time.</p>
<p>A single file of Boomies are walking around in the staircase. We take care of them, but not before Klonoa takes recoil from their explosions!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/iK7af4A.png alt="green statue gone" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>There, green statues gone!</p>
<p>We&#39;re back in one of the previous rooms!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/zrRkern.png alt="flying moos bunched up" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>We throw the Boomie and get an extra life, but I miss more dream stones. We rescue friend number five, and head back to the atrium.</p>
<p>We cross into the entryway where the green statue used to be.</p>
<p>After getting hit by the Ghosts and creatures, these hearts are a breath of air.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/b0KpZXY.png alt="more hearts" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>In the next room, we&#39;re introduced to disappearing platforms!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/XxTVRSI.png alt="vanishing platforms" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>The dream sprite challenge was pretty easy, but quick.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Outside again, more disappearing platforms! The yellow ones are longer, and last longer, while the blue ones are smaller, and last for a short second.</p>
<p>We end up falling because I underestimated how long the gap was bw the yellow and the stardust platform.</p>
<p>We end up getting our last friend out!</p>
<p>Now how are we going to break that crystal?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/lNugu5J.png alt="yellow crystal" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>Dream sprite challenge time, and it is a tough one!</p>
<p>Another life gone...</p>
<p>We sort of manage to get it by the second try (I end up getting a dream stone too early).</p>
<p>Now that the yellow statue is gone, how can we get up there?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/goZ3Og8.png alt="how to get up there?" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>I enter back into the atrium through the blue dust entrance, and climb the steps filled with ex-yellow statues.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/FQWm1Ao.png alt="at the top" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>More disappearing platforms later, and we&#39;re inside the center of the kingdom!</p>
<p>I&#39;m guessing that the pulsing rock beneath us is what keeps the Moon Kingdom floating.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/QERu2ej.png alt="pulsing rock" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>Up the steps...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/JLnYph6.png alt="white crystal" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>We break the white crystal, activating the elevator to the upper floors!</p>

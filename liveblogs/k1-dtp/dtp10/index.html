<p>According to one of the director&#39;s tweets for this game (posted and translated in English in <a href=https://klonoa-at-blog.tumblr.com/post/172434542603/klonoa-chronicles-33>this tumblr post</a>), he mentioned one of the artists made an evolutionary line of the Moos, starting with an octopus-like Moo, which made a cameo in the previous level, frozen in a pilar of ice, but I did not see it in my playthrough...</p>

<p>Pamela drops us off at the foot of the temple. She apologizes for not going any farther. It&#39;s okay.</p>
<p>Someone pointed out on Twitter that <a href=https://twitter.com/flahr/status/1557485174941630464>Klonoa&#39;s the only video game character on record, from that person&#39;s experience, that thanks people for taking him on rides</a>.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/OjGFIHG.png alt="thank you" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p><strong>Pamela:</strong> &quot;Klonoa... Be careful.&quot; With that, she leaves.</p>
<p>As Klonoa enters a pipe, we drop down in the next area.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/9pf4uCc.png alt="temple entrance" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>The duo are a bit amazed at the temple.</p>
<p>Someone calls to Klonoa and Huepow, in a gurgling voice, like they&#39;re in an aquarium tank.</p>
<p>Other voices speak...</p>
<p>They&#39;ve been asking us why we were slow to get here.</p>
<p>How do they know Klonoa and Huepow?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Q5lh2Wu.png alt="the sun priests" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>Solare and Soleil are the sun priests.</p>
<p><a name=2></a></p>
<hr>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/3gfH3fb.png alt=greetings id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>Klonoa and Huepow wonder the same thing I&#39;m wondering...</p>
<p>Huepow asks about Joka without mentioning his name. Yes.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/UJyOAQn.png alt=pedestals id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>V&#39;z trggvat ivorf sebz gur frdhry urer...</p>
<p><strong>Solare</strong>: &quot;An orb must be placed on each one to open the door to the altar.&quot;<br>
<strong>Soleil</strong>: &quot;Need orbs.&quot;<br>
<strong>Solare</strong>: &quot;But the orbs have all been taken by followers of Ghadius.&quot;<br>
<strong>Soleil</strong>: &quot;Without permission!&quot;</p>
<p>So they ask us to bring back the orbs. Soleil is a bit more...frank about the situation.</p>
<p>Solare is begging, Soleil threatens us if we don&#39;t succeed...</p>
<p>Klonoa asks what our next move is. Simple, get the orbs back. </p>
<p>Where to start, though?</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/opx5b2F.png alt=pedestals id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>I decide on going after red first.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a better close up of the bottom area of the pedestal room.</p>

<hr>
<p>Exiting the nearest pipe first, we&#39;re now at the west wing of the temple.</p>
<p>Onto the platform, which takes us higher. We use a flying Moo to rescue our first friend above a pool of molten metal...</p>
<p>And make it to the tunnel leading to the red orb.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/PpTPez6.png alt="red orb entrance" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>Collecting a few dream stones first before entering...</p>
<p>We jump onto another moving platform.</p>
<p>Knowing there&#39;s molten liquid below, I take it steady.</p>
<p>After pushing two metal boards down, we proceed.</p>
<p>Still proceeding gingerly, we rescue another friend!</p>
<p>Pushing the boards down made makeshift bridges!</p>
<p>And Klonoa slips and falls into the molten pool!</p>
<p>Back at the metal boards again, I worry that they&#39;re going to bounce back up if Klonoa stands there for too long.</p>
<p>After passing them, we make it!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/EfSpCGn.png alt="red orb get" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>Now to get out...the only way is up!</p>
<p>I miss a dream sprite challenge because of a spikey blocking the way!</p>
<p>Eternally spawning Moos are the next obstacle.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/p90AQcB.png alt="spawning moos" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>They follow a pattern, but how do I use them to pass the fiery spout here?</p>
<p>I throw the bare Moo at the checkpoint, and figure out how to hit the egg next.</p>
<p>With no luck, after some playing around, I use the bare Moo to get over the flame column!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/bfvFnIZ.png alt="first orb in" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>First orb in!</p>
<p>Now for the blue one.</p>
<p><a name=4></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The blue orb&#39;s situated outside this time.</p>
<p>We encounter another new creature, a ball-and-chain wielder!</p>
<p>The iron bars make it hard to tell if the platform is flush with the beam.</p>
<p>Not before taking damage, I take out an armor from a Moo and throw him to rescue friend number three!</p>
<p>After a while, we get the blue orb and go back in the temple!</p>
<p>The temple has blacksmith and terracotta aesthetics. It feels like a foreshadowing of what I&#39;m going to be seeing (or reseeing) in the next game.</p>
<p>We encounter the rotating spawning Moos again, jumping to and fro from the back to the front, along with a ball-and-chainer.</p>
<p>Fourth friend out!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/CIsSYkB.png alt="second orb in" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>And second orb back in place!</p>
<p>Now for the east wing!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/7EWN5AX.png alt="to east wing" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>I get too eager and Klonoa gets caught in one of the fire spouts!</p>
<p>One life gone, but not bowed out. Seeing a fork in the road at the top, we go right, avoiding fire spouts!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/BJE1fWR.png alt="how to open?" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>Now how to open that door?</p>
<p>After seeing a dead end forward, I backtrack, picking up a Moo to hit the switch enclosed by a brick wall.</p>
<p>That did the trick, as the way out is open!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/ZNRJb7N.png alt="green door open" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>There&#39;s the green orb!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/aq3Le5r.png alt="green orb" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>All we need to do is open two more gates, and were done with this part!</p>
<p><a name=5></a></p>
<hr>
<p>After pulling off a neat trick that, if it failed, would&#39;ve had Klonoa in the molten pool, we go in and open the third door.</p>
<p>Now that&#39;s a long drop!</p>
<p>I mistime the jump and fall down to the ground floor without rescuing the fifth friend!</p>
<p>A line of armored Moos march at us below!</p>
<p>With help from the mantarays, we get friend number five, and take care of the single file of armored Moos.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/JZbI56A.png alt="third orb in" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>Now for the last orb...</p>
<p>We take the left path back in the room with the green doorways.</p>
<p>After avoiding losing a life from the ball-and-chainers, we face another challenge.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/56BSL07.png alt="dream sprite challenge" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>These dream sprites are getting trickier, as expected late-game.</p>
<p>Another snag.</p>
<p>We make it and a flying Moo spawns, then we fall!</p>
<p>Let&#39;s see if I gather all the stones this time.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t, but we rescue our last friend, and pick up the last orb!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/qTI2fxv.png alt="last orb get" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>The orbs shine as the central door opens up!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/27fX6sF.png alt="center door open" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p><a name=6></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Now what&#39;s in this room? </p>
<p>Where does this platform take us? The music&#39;s gone silent too.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/WdP7vtd.png alt="platform and switch?" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>We activate the switch!</p>
<p>A pillar of light emerges!</p>
<p>Soleil and Solare commend us, in their own way, for opening the way to the altar. They tell us to proceed.</p>
<p>Klonoa&#39;s a bit nervous...</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/YuRkWXQ.png alt="you have our permission" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>One of the flying messengers comes in, who whispers news for Solare: a solar eclipse. By Solare&#39;s reaction, that&#39;s not a good sign.</p>
<p>Solare suspects Ghadius, since he has the Pendant.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/wLgR33o.png alt=ghadius id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>Yup, Ghadius has darkness written all over him.</p>
<p><strong>Solare</strong>: &quot;He has awakened from a 3,000 year sleep, and now seeks revenge.&quot;<br>
<strong>Soleil</strong>: &quot;In other words, Mr. Evil himself.&quot;</p>
<p>Solare tells us to beat Ghadius and his minions to the Sun Altar before they do.</p>
<p>Klonoa asks the priests how they&#39;ll fare.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/3LtOzPz.png alt="we're wimps" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>Ha.</p>
<p>Klonoa jumps into the pillar of light!</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/iuSxvfy.png alt="vision clear" id=liveblog width=480 height=360></p>
<p>The platform below escorts him up...</p>
<p>I noticed this before, but the more friends we rescue, the longer the song gets.</p>

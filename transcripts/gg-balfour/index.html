<p><em>Description here later on Galloway&#39;s background info, and the history behind the Balfour Declaration Concerning Israel...</em></p>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/GuxuCF1RALQ>Here&#39;s the link to the video.</a></p>
<p>I&#39;m George Galloway and this is a necessarily abbreviated version of what I would have said at the big Palestine demonstration in London to mark the 100th of the Balfour Declaration. And indeed, what I would have said at any of the other Balfour commemorations too. I&#39;ve spoken about this in Parliament and on public platforms for more years than I care to remember. But it would be wrong for me not to say something on the centenary events.</p>
<p>The important thing to remember about Balfour is that it was yet another imperial lie yet another British imperial crime. After all, Britain did not even possess Palestine, in the warped logic of imperial possessions at the time that it gave it away. It was thus unique even by imperialist standards as an imperial crime, because it represented one people promising to a second people that land that belonged to a third people, even before .</p>
<p>The second thing that needs to be remembered is that this is not ancient history. Balfour made this declaration 100 years ago. That means there&#39;s actually a small, but increasing number of people who were alive at the time he made it. It is also important to remember that the great crime at Naqba, at Catastrophe. And the subsequent crimes against Palestine in the Swinging Sixties, in 1967, the crime in Jordan in Black September in 1970, Lebanon 1982, are all easily in the lifetime of many people . took place under the aegis of the people who are still in power today. So let me be unequivocal. <strong>Palestine belongs to the Palestinian people.</strong></p>
<p>So, what to do? The only solution is a bi-national state between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. A bi-national state of Israel-Palestine or Palestine-Israel.</p>
<p>I&#39;m sorry that I haven&#39;t been asked to speak at the demonstration in London, but, I wouldn&#39;t want to let the occasion pass without having my say. I&#39;m George Galloway, and I hope the demonstration is a big success.</p>

Happy New Year! Gong Xi Fa Cai!

After a [disastrous start][LA Fires] to the new year, and a lot of, for lack of a better explanation (or excuse) for not updating this blog, transformations, I'm back!

While browsing for an anime that was on my watchlist on the Crunchyrolls, I stumbled upon *Natsume's Book of Friends* again, and saw that there was a seventh season! I saw last year's [announcement video][s7-vid], and thought that another season was an impossible feat, or that it would take ample time for it to be released.

But it goes to show how fast a year can go by.

Anyway, now that the seventh season of that wonderful, warm show is back, it's given me slight motivation to start liveblogging again, though mentally tiring as the labor is, after 2 and a half years. I'll have to get myself acquainted again by rewatching a few episodes before starting up the new season. The *Natsume* liveblog index page has been updated to take account for that.

I've just remembered that I need to transfer the domain name for this liveblog. The price for renewing it is getting too expensive, though the old domain hosts giving it away to another host--most likely because of updated [ICANN standards][icann] a few years ago--are partly to blame for that change. Originally, under the old domain hosts, I would've paid around $5.99/year for upkeep, now because of the change in hosting, it's $39.99/year! I found an alternative domain host, but the transfer process, if I get around to it, will take some time.

As for updates on other stuff like the *Tales of Arise* playthrough, that will be uploaded soon, provided I have time to post the screencaps and edit my posts.

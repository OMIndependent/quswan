Because I usually rush in doing stuff, I forgot to mention a few things from yesterday.

If anyone's wondering about *Terranigma*, posts for that game will still be uploaded, though it will be the two new games and *Tales of Arise* that will take priority.

Also, I need to bring up the spoiler policy for the new games I'll be playing. **No spoilers** are allowed for the first game, and **allowed but ciphered**, for any newcomers in the franchise, for the second.

Tomorrow night, expect the first playthrough posts of *Arise* to be up.

Good night!

Hello, folks! I'm here to announce the posting schedule of my replay playthrough of an old favorite:

<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQxZTRiMzctYjUwNi00M2QyLWFjY2QtZGFlNzhiNTg1MTY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA0MTM5NjI2._V1_.jpg" alt="k2-lv" width="288" height="432.2" />

*Klonoa 2: Lunatea's Veil*!

I'll be posting every Friday to Sunday night, so expect the first posts tomorrow.

To remind everyone, I'll be playing the Nintendo Switch remake version instead of the original PS2 version.

For this game, as I said last month, spoilers are **allowed** but **ciphered** using [ROT13](https://rot13.com), so as not to spoil anything for newcomers reading through these posts!

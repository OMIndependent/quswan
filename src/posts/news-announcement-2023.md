Long time no see! Aside from the publication for the last *Klonoa 2* post, things have gone stagnant. 

I wasn't keen on making updates here since I've been busy and lazy. Plus, it takes certain know-how and stringent inspection to ensure this blogsite is bug-free per update.

I delved into my deep thoughts [last Monday on my old tumblr for its 10th anniversary][tumblr] on where that blog's going to end up. I usually don't make announcements here out of the blue, if ever, but some news came about that made me reconsider returning to making regular updates.

First, the announcement for [*Tales of Arise: Beyond the Dawn*][toa:bod] last Thursday was one cause for celebration, though not enough for a simple update. 

However, another [announcement][ny-announce] while I was lurking around online threw me into disbelief and excitement (mostly the former). I've already updated the index page for this show, too!

The next steps on where this blogsite is going to go is that I'll finally release more *Super Mario RPG* posts, before the remake gets shipped in November. More *Tales of Arise* and the start of the third act of *Terranigma* are also in the pipeline.

See you on the other side.

Inside the tunnel, I take the bottom way and walk along the mine tracks. I double back a bit to get to the top, but after seeing Bob-ombs walking on the hall, I stick to my original course.

At the end of the tunnel, I use the nearby stack crates to jump up, wondering if there's some treasure blocks around...

While getting the coins in a chest block, more monsters come...

I wander around some more in the mine tunnels, heading back along the mine tracks. As I enter into the next area...

...a Shy Guy riding a minecart comes out of the tunnel!

The minecart crashes onto the stack of crates!

Lucky I retrieve a Frog Coin from the collision as the Shy Guy runs away!

Avoiding the Bob-ombs, I jump back up to the tunnel and cross forward into a mine track bridge, where four Bob-ombs in square formation march, blocking the way forward...

I see a save block on the other side, but I'm trying to figure out how to pass the Bob-ombs...

Reading a guide online, it turns out that I missed a chest block containing a Star!

Getting that, I knock off a few Bob-ombs along the way!

Unfortunately, I wasn't fast enough to get to the Bob-ombs near the bridge, and I get into an encounter!

I manage to escape!

With a leap of faith, I jump past the Bob-ombs, now out of formation, and make it!

I get another Mushroom from a chest block, and save at this point...

I also pick up an extra Flower from a higher chest, using a stack of crates for more height!

After asking a tadpole's favorite song: **Frogfucius's Suite #18**, I head off to Melody Bay.

My composing skills aren't very good... :frowning2:

I meet Toadofsky at the other end of the bay, who offers to give us lessons on how to "play" Melody Bay.

I head back to the tadpole at the entrance to memorize the scales of Frogfucius's Suite **(So La Mi Re Do Re Do Re)** and head back to Melody Bay. I'm also told by the tadpole that Toadofsky likes that melody...

I ask Toadofsky how Melody Bay works. It's also a pretty good basic refresher for me too...he explains the scales:

**In between lines two and three - Do<br/>
Above - Do Re Mi<br/>
Below - Do Ti La So Fa**

I try my hand at composing **Frogfucius's Suite** a few times.

I succeed on the third try, and Toadofsky jumps in excitement, his hands and baton shaking in joy!

He thanks us for playing the suite, and gives us an **Alto Card**, which gives us a membership to the Juice Bar here!

After checking out the Frog Coin Emporium, I look at the Juice Bar wares, which only has a Froggie Drink and an **Elixir**...

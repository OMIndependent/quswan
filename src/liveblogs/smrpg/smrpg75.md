Since I want to get this sidequest finished quickly, I decide to take a look at a [guide online to compose the Monstro Town star song](https://www.gamefaqs.com/snes/588739-super-mario-rpg-legend-of-the-seven-stars/faqs/54434?print=1).

The notes for this one are: **La Ti Do Re Mi So Do Re Mi**

After succeeding on the second try, Toadofsky jumps in joy at our piece, and gives us another Juice Bar membership card.

**Toadofsky:** "Finally, my song is near complete. But I must confess that you contributed a lot to it. We can all take credit for it! Now you must think of a final phrase that will wrap it all up. Let your creative juices flow and **show me what you got!**"

Mario runs rapidly back to the start!

Now we get to make up our own tune!

Where to start...?

I jump on a couple of notes, I feel like the final piece I made sounds a bit melancholic...

Toadofsky then looks at the whole piece together!

He starts the music, with Mario as his co-conductor!

The tadpoles applaud our symphony!

I talk to Toadofsky again, who asks what we think of our piece. I say nothing and save here.

The tadpole outside Melody Bay thought it was a pretty good piece.

I go to the Juice Bar, where I show off the **Soprano Card** to the shopkeeper! They're amazed!

We can now get KeroKero Colas!

I buy two Megalixirs and head off to see Frogfucius!

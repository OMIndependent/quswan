Taking a glimpse of [the area map of Bean Valley](http://www.mariouniverse.com/wp-content/img/maps/snes/smrpg/le-beanvalley.png), I decide to visit the circle of pipes blocked by the Piranha Plants there...

I try to avoid the Stingers on the way...

Now here I am...all I have to do is wait for the Shy Away to start his watering.

I save at the nearest block before taking on the Piranha Plants on there.

I take care of the Chewy plants and sink into the first pipe.

There's a crowd of Geckits and a golden Chain Chomp, or a **Chomp Chomp**, in the grotto of the first pipe.

I take on the Chomp Chomp first. I get a **Crystalline** as a reward, and bounce back up to the surface.

Next Piranha Plant to take care of!

Instead of going in the pipes, I take care of all the Piranha Plants there...

For the third Piranha Plant battle, I get not just Chewys, but their friends too: two Geckits and a Kriffid!

Just one more Plant to take care of now...

There! Everything's in the clear!

For the next pipe I should travel to, I'll go clockwise!

Inside the second pipe, I get the nearest chest block there, which is...a monster-in-a-box!

The chest monster is a **Box Boy** this time!

I have Mario Super Jump the chest monster, causing massive damage! In return, the Box Boy uses **Blast**, almost near-KO'ing Geno!

After Peach heals Geno, the Box Boy summons a genie-like monster called **Fautso** to his side!

Another Super Jump from Mario should do the trick! No good! Box Boy counters with another Blast, knocking Peach out!

Fautso's also strong too!

**What!?** Box Boy can attack twice!?

After a bit of an interruption offline, I'm back!

I have Peach revive Mario! But now, the worst of Fautso and Box Boy's attacks come! Fautso uses **Aurora Flash** and **Boulder**, while Box Boy reveals he's a Big Boo in a chest!

One final Super Jump move (10? Jumps in a row!) and Box Boy is finished!

Now for Fautso...

I have Mario Super Jump Fautso once more, and have Peach use the Crystalline!

One timed hit from Geno finishes him off!

Mario levels up! So does Mallow! I give them a magical stat bonus boost!

Back to the map, I have Mario jump up the stairs, and take the bounce pad up to a corner of the valley where a chest block is!

It has a Frog Coin inside!

I sink into the pipe, where Mario jump near a corner, where a Frog Coin is!

Into the third pipe in the circle of pipes!

This chest block looks different than the others we've opened...

It's a slot machine chest block! I manage to get two flowers and a mushroom! I get a Flower as a prize!

In the fourth pipe, I get a slot machine chest block, which I lose at! Time for another battle with a Box Boy!

With Mario's Super Jumps, I manage to survive that encounter!

Bowser also levels up too! I upgrade his health!

I sink into the fifth pipe, where I get another slot machine chest block, and I get three mushrooms, which rewards me with a Frog Coin!

I check the area map again. It seems there were also hidden chests, or Surprise Blocks, here too...

The first one I pick up has a **Red Essence**, and the second one has a **KeroKero Cola**!

I save before grabbing the last hidden chest block in this area...

And that's it! I go back to Monstro Town and save there!

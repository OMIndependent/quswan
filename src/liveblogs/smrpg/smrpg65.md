Off to Nimbus Land we go!

I take the left bouncepad and I'm now in the town proper! The place feels like an Adventure Time-esque city in the clouds!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/8teKrK8.png" alt="cloud citizens" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Someone, however, yells to get the citizens at attention!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/hQufTiS.png" alt="attention" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Her name is **Valentina**. She mentions the King is not getting any better, and that the town will be losing its ruler... :frowning2:

**Valentina:** "**But!**...It just so happens that I have found the missing Prince! Prince Mallow, that is!"

Wait, wait, wait, so Mallow's the prince, and he's with us...shouldn't he be inside waiting for Valentina's cue?

Valentina summons "Prince Mallow" in a...rather courteous manner that Scorpion would applaud her for.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/MDMr9F4.png" alt="get over here" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Valentina announces that the "Prince" has "stage fright," and heads inside to tell the "Prince" to hurry up!

Unfortunately, "Prince" Mallow can't get through the doorway...

There's the Prince, who doesn't look like a cloud person at all...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/lylRytm.png" alt="prince mallow?" width="480"  height="360" />

Everyone welcomes the "Prince" with open arms, but are still a bit surprised at the appearance of the "Prince"...

The "Prince" asks Valentina for something...she thinks he's being serious, and doesn't know what to say...

She announces immediately that she will marry "Prince" Mallow!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/p3NGS3g.png" alt="marriage" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Valentina is internally relishing the thought of being the Queen of Nimbus Land for some reason...she dismisses the citizenry...she tells the "Prince" to hurry up back there.

Mallow's surprised too, because he sees a Prince with the same name as his! Maybe it's because **you're** the real Prince, Mallow!

Mallow tells us we should be finding the rest of the Star Pieces.

I head for the inn first and save there.

I talk to one of the citizens outside, who tells us that he was fired by Valentina after one day for no reason and says the king needs him...

I head into the shop, where there's new gear, such as Fuzzy armor, a **Mega Glove** for Mario, a **War Fan** for Peach, a **Hand Cannon** for Geno, and a **Sticky Glove** for Mallow!

I buy the Fuzzy equipment and the new weapons, and some items.

Outside, I talk to another cloud citizen, who doesn't like the new guards there...

I head into Garro the sculptor's house, where he's at the far end of the house, his back turned.

Wait, is that golden sculpture...?

The citizens still think the big black bird is Prince Mallow!

One citizen, who used to work in the palace, mentions "poor Dodo" and the mistreatment he gets from Valentina... :frowning2:

Another has never heard of Star Pieces, but he's watching the volcano below...

One remembers the actual Prince as small and timid...

There's even a royal bus that the King used to use...

We now try to go forward into the castle, but the Birdys don't like people barging in...

I head up west, where I think this might be where the Royal Bus is usually parked....

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/RynDaxr.png" alt="patch of cloud" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

I head back to the inn, where the innkeeper offers a Dream Cushion for 60 coins...technically, it's 30 coins for the night, and 30 more for the cushion. I have Mario accept the night's stay with the cushion.

Mario has dreams of Chef Tortes working and walking around, surrounded by huge ingredients...

Now where should we head off to next?

I have Mario head back to the sculptor, maybe he knows something...

He says that he's now ordered to make sculptures for Valentina, who's taken up residence in King Nimbus's castle.

We go near the sculpture.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/2JBA4OR.png" alt="hey look its me" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Mallow notices himself in the sculpture! But, Garro comes and says that it's actually King Nimbus when he was younger!

Garro then does a double take...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DO11mC2.png" alt="who are you!?" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Mallow introduces himself, and Mario, to Garro.

Garro rejoices at Mallow's return!

Mallow jumps super super high in shock!

Mario then starts his charades, explaining everything that's happened to the sculptor.

He imitates the scene where Frogfucius said that Mallow is **NOT a tadpole**, even Mallow's reaction.

Garro confirms that our Mallow is the real prince of Nimbus Land.

**Mallow:** "Mario! Look at me! I'm a prince!" ^O^

Mario stoops his head low.

**Garro:** "I knew Valentina was up to something! I just didn't know what...that must mean that the King really isn't gravely ill...!"

Mallow wants to go save the castle now! Mallow's now super angry and pumped up!

But the Birdys stop him...

Mallow returns, disappointed.

Garro, though, has a plan to get us in the castle, all we have to do is say the word, and he will prepare the plan...

I save and stop here.

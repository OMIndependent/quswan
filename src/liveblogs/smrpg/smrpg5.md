I check around town before heading into the palace...

There's a save block in the inn, which I use, and look at the wares in the Item Shop.

I buy some recovery items, and a **Shirt**. I have Mario equip both the **Hammer** that I got after beating the Hammer Bros and the **Shirt**.

After saving again at the inn, it's time to face the Chancellor!

I head in to the castle, where Toad tells me that he'll notify the Chancellor that we're here...

I wander around the castle, and I bounce around on Peach's bed...it's so bouncy...

Heading downstairs, there's two rooms: a Vault Room south, where a Toad is guarding the way, and a Guest Room north, where I head into and jump on that bed, which is also bouncy.

I head back to the entrance hall and into the anteroom, where I follow Toad in...

There's the Chancellor...

He notes to us the explosion near Bowser's castle and asks where Peach is.

Mario panics!

Mario does charades to explain to the Chancellor what happened so far...Mario even portrays Bowser and Peach convincingly...the charades are a bit funny...

The Chancellor tells us that Peach's life is in our hands...

Mario nods, and we leave.

But the Chancellor stops us, and gives us something: a **Map!**

We leave, but the Chancellor stops us again. He gives us permission to take whatever we need from the vaults.

For each treasure we take in the Vault Room, the Toad Guard explains everything.

We get a Mushroom that restores all our HP and FP, another Flower (upgrading Mario's FP by one), and 10 coins.

I ask the Toad Guard about FPs, and I leave.

Outside, someone's yelling "**Come back here!!!**"

A purple dinosaur runs while a cloud person pursues them.

The cloud person says that the dinosaur stole his grandpa's coin!

He tries not to cry...then he cries...and it rains. Poor cloud person... :frowning2:

I head to the inn and save.

Before I shut off the game, I check the map the Chancellor gave us.

The beginning part of the game's...pretty okay so far. I hope it gets more interesting...

<a href="https://youtu.be/oShuhcg9LlU">Here's the music for Yo'ster Isle.</a>

I talk to the Yoshis, who respond in chirps.

I read the letter in the mailbox, which contains honeymoon reservations for two...

I have Mario approach the green Yoshi, which is the Yoshi we know! Yoshi's talking to Mario in his head, and properly welcomes us to Yo'ster Isle.

Yoshi then asks for our help, but Mario doesn't understand a word that the Yoshis say. Lucky Yoshi comes along to translate for us! I have Mario hop aboard Yoshi!

I talk to Boshi, the tough-talking, purple Yoshi with sunglasses, who wants cookies before we challenge him...

The rest of the Yoshi want to all have a race together, but Boshi only does one-on-one races...

I go southwest, which leads me back to the world map. I stay on Yo'ster Isle to look around for anything I missed.

Well, nothing's here. I head back out...

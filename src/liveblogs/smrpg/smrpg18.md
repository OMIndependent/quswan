Now at Rose Way, I read the nearby sign before the base of the river, which says that I can't jump on or off when yellow blocks turn blue.

I jump to the nearest yellow block, which turns blue, and whizzes me to another block, which I have it stop at an island where a mushroom sits...

I get the remaining items in the lake...

...while newer creatures come after us: an **Arachne** and a **Starslap!**

Mallow's new **Froggie Stick** gives him better attack!

I let the yellow platform turn blue, which hovers to two exits in the area...

I take the northwest one...

There's a treasure block high up, and two swinging platforms with **Shy Guys** on them!

There's two Shy Guys and a Snapdragon I have to face...

The Shy Guy silenced Mario with a Doom Reverb...

The Shy Guy's got a range of special attacks, and he's hard to mind read!

Mario gains another level, and I boost his health further!

I'm running out of Mushrooms here too...

I jump on one of the swinging platforms and wait until the second one's within reach to face off against the next set of Shy Guy forces...

Mallow also levels up, and I increase Mallow's defense and attack!

After a few attempts, I manage to get another Frog Coin from the chest!

I go back, trying to get the floating coins, no chance.

There are some robber enemies I run into that lunge at me and then run away...are they like Metal Slimes in that if you defeat them you get tons of gold?

I head forward into the next area, the same lake where the yellow-to-blue platforms are.

After getting the coins there, it's off to the southwest area, where a Shy Guy's sitting on top of a chest block!

The Arachne, when I had Mallow scan him, is singing Day-O in his head...

There's a lot of Shy Guys on treasure chests in this area!

So the robber enemy's name is a **Crook**...

In one battle where he doesn't run, I finish off the Crook quickly.

Oh no, the Arachne's pulling out its Venom Drool!

A few more battles and chest blocks of coins later, I see Goombas in single file in the next area...that's strange...

Once we get there, Mario pulls Mallow to hide...

Looks like Bowser's alive. Now he's ordering his troops: the Magikoopas, the Terrapins, and the Goombas to attention!

Bowser and his troops march away, planning to take back Bowser's castle...

Mallow tells us that Rose Town is up ahead.

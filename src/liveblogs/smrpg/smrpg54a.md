Back at the Sea, I buy some more items and new Sailor equipment for Geno and Mallow from the hooded shopkeeper...

Just as a little diversion, before making the trip back to Seaside, I head to the Mushroom Kingdom. There's someone I want to meet...

I talk to a Toad (?) in the corner of the house before the palace, who tells me to avoid "pointy monsters on Star Hill". Are they the Mastadooms?

I then head into the palace, where a Toad tells me they'll keep the Princess safe! :laughing:

They don't know the actual Princess is with us!

The person I wanted to see isn't in the guest room though...

I head back and save at the sea cavern.

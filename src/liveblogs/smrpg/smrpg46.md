As we head outside the palace, a voice shouts:

**???:** "**Mario!!!**"

It's the Princess, floating down on a parasol!

She begs us with all her might if she could join us. **Yes!!!!**

Mario is not too sure, though...

She tells us that her grandma helped her sneak out of the castle...

She wonders where the next Star Piece is...but doesn't know where to look!

Mario doesn't know where the next Star Piece is either, but Mallow does know what to do if they're lost: Go ask Frogfucius!

Yes, she does!

I save at the inn.

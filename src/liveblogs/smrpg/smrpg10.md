I warm up a bit by fighting a few monsters before heading back to the Mushroom Kingdom...

Oh my god! Shy Guys on pogo sticks!

While trying to talk to the Toad guard, I get into a battle with two Shy Guys, or Shysters, on pogo sticks!

The Shysters are pretty hard to hit for Mallow!

The Toad guard thanks us for stopping them, and gives us 10 coins!

I get into another battle with two more Shysters, bouncing around the blue Toad.

One of them tries to drain Mallow's health!

After taking care of them, I give the wallet back to the blue Toad, and get a **Flower Tab!**

More Flower Points yes!

I use all the Flower Tabs I have (one of them I got after beating Croco)!

I take care of more Shy Guys on pogo sticks! Where are they coming from?

Mario reaches Level 5! I increase his magical stats.

After another battle, so does Mallow! I choose to increase Mallow's attack and defense.

I head into one of the houses...

**...holy heck!** The Toads are trembling in fright, while the little brother upstairs is still jumping on the bed and is awed at one of the Shy Guys's bouncing!

I take care of the Shy Guys in the house...and I get another **Flower Tab**.

The little brother is also told by his father that he'll be like Mario someday...awww...

As I head to the palace, I see more Shy Guys (on pogo sticks!) bouncing out of the entrance!

Holy heck, I'm laughing a bit at this point!

In the antechamber east, I have Mario jump on top of a Toad guard jumping in panic...

I could do this all day...

I head to the guest room north to find the trembling vault guard in the corner...he finds a coin (which is all his!), and sees us. He gives us a **Wake Up Pin!**

I head to the other side of the palace, and take care of more Shysters!

I now head upstairs to Peach's bedroom...and the Shy Guys flanking the doors stop us!

**Shy Guy:** "**NOT SO FAST, PAL!**"

After that battle, we go in to Peach's chamber.

The maid tells us that we may not sleep in the Princess's bed and heals us instead!

I save my progress on the save block there, bounce on Peach's bed a bit, and go downstairs to take care of more Shy Guys...

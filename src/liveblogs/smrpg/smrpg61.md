I'll probably fight Culex again after I get all seven Star Pieces.

I buy some more stuff in the Goomba's Weapon & Armor Shop before meeting the Toad in the first house.

For Bowser, he gets a new weapon and armor: a **Spiked Link**, and a **Courage Shell**.

Before meeting the Toad, I play around with the fan monster on the end of the room. I switch it to 'Blast', and he turns red!

The Toad, **Monstermama**, is surprised to see visitors like us! She's the landlady of Monstro Town.

Mario pantomimes his "star get" post and makes the Star Piece sound effect to tell her what he wants!

Monstermama thinks that Mario's there to see "their" Star, who's upstairs...

I have Mario look upstairs to find her.

That is definitely a Star, but not a Star Piece...

I have Mario interact with her. She dances on the table...

I talk to the Pandorite next, who tells me about hidden chests, which "pop out of thin air," he says, if I jump at the right place.

So these hidden chest blocks have a name: **Surprise Boxes**. Luckily, we ran into some!

He points out there are still **29** more we need to look for.

I talk to the Rat Funk, who mentions the elderly Gardener from Rose Town that we met earlier.

We head back down to meet Monstermama, who asks us if we think their "Star"'s adorable. She also points out that the Star's talented too!

Mario shakes his head no. That's not what we're looking for...

**Monstermama:** "Oh, Star Piece! Nope, not familiar with 'em. So, you came all the way to search for a Star Piece? It must be **really** important. This is the last place on land. If you can't find it here...the only place left, is **UP!**"

Mario's in shock at the idea! He accepts, and wants to go up!

Monstermama mentions a secret passage to the sky at **Bean Valley**. But we have to climb the cliff we saw earlier at Land's End.

Monstermama then calls for help:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/cVxVYL4.png" alt="sky troopas" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

They're not coming...then they come!

The Sky Troopas are summoned!

It took them 8.52 seconds to get into Monstermama's house!

Sgt. Flutter is their leader!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/EDV6035.png" alt="sgt flutter late" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Sgt. Flutter points out the Troopas are 0.52 seconds late. So the Sky Troopas come in 8 seconds exactly after they're called...

Monstermama points out Sgt. Flutter's adherence with the rules, and tells him to let that go in front of her. She tells them about us getting to Bean Valley.

They have their orders: "Get Mustache over the cliff."

They liftoff and leave the house to tell the other troops!

I go into the next door, where a Chow, a Thwomp, and a Piranha Plant live...

The Piranha Plant mentions the guy next door, mentioning "Crystal-this and an Evil-that." The Crystal, the Piranha Plant points out, is a "shiny rock.."

I have Mario talk to Thwomp next who jumps and stomps the floor! He mentions Mario being a legendary jumper! I have Mario follow his lead and talk to him again, who says that Mario's "out-pumped!"

Looks like this is going to be a casual competition...

The Chow records Mario's Super Jumps, which are only at **1**...

The Chow promises to give us a prize if we do **30** Super Jumps in a row in battle!

If I talk to the Thwomp again, the key above the perch's going to fall...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/U9vC2XL.png" alt="key at edge" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

After another talk with him, I head out and grab the **Temple Key!**

Back to Belome's Temple, we make for the treasure room, where we face the golden Belome...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DfrTmei.png" alt="gold belome" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

...and we give him the key, which he gobbles up, and vanishes!

The treasures here are now ours!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/zxDiMt2.png" alt="treasures" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

I grab all 8 Frog Coins, that makes it 36! I'm guessing that's enough to buy the Coin Trick from Frogfucius's Student at Seaside!

Items next, and they're a Royal Syrup, a Max Mushroom, and a **Fire Bomb**!

Finally, the four Flowers!

I head back, and buy the **Coin Trick** (exactly 36 Frog Coins, yes!), and head to Land's End after saving.

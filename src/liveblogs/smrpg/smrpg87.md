The final Star Piece is ours!

Geno tells us to send the Star Piece immediately up high to the heavens!

Now the seven stars are back in their resting place...

The seven stars surround Geno...

Everyone raises their arms as Geno the tiny star places the pieces back and soars away...the six star encircle the seventh in a dance, ascending to join their friends.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Cz02NT8.png" alt="the end" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

**The end.**

I sort of surprised myself here: I was expecting to finish this game after my trip, but now it's over!

I listen to the [game's rendition of the **Super Mario Bros.** first level music](https://youtu.be/nO66ohWJxNs) awhile before turning off the game.

There's some stuff I didn't get to finish in this playthrough, like the Yoshi vs. Boshi race, or beating Culex, or the final round with Jinx, but, oh well...

**That's that!**

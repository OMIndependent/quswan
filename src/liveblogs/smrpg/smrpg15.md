After a few battles as warm ups, I have Mario jump into the northeast pipe.

These sewers never end, don't they?

I fall into a chamber, in front of an open-mouthed four-eyed tiger with a huge door behind him!

We pass the tiger and head for the door. But it's sealed shut, with Mallow wondering how to open it!

We bounce back up to the Boo filled passage, trying to get the second chest block above.

It seems in order to get that chest, I'll need to get in to this chamber by the northwestern pipe on the tall ledge.

Unfortunately, there are no ways to get up there, and I head back down, where the tiger is...

The tiger is...**Belome!?**

Mallow points out the "fire hose" on his tongue...

He talks to us!

We're now in a boss fight!

I have Mario attack Belome, with Mallow scanning the boss, where Belome has 461 HP! In reading his mind, I find out that he wants a bib for his "room service"...

Belome is **very** hungry...

...and he eats Mallow!

**Belome:** "Stick for a body, head for a straw, give me a scarecrow, rah, rah, **RAH!**"

He breathes dust on Mario to turn him into a scarecrow...

Lucky that's not going to work! Mario has a Trueform Pin equipped!

With a Super Jump from Mario, Belome spits out Mallow!

Belome really wants to turn Mario into a scarecrow so badly...

Belome swallows Mallow again!

We finally finish him, but Belome tells us that we won't beat him even if we defeat him. What does that mean? He warns us of a flood in his last breath...uh oh... :frowning2:

The big doors now open. Mallow's tempting fate here...

We're now hearing sounds of water...

Mallow tells Mario to step on the switch, but in their panic, Mallow gets knocked out. Mario hits the switch, but too late! The water comes rushing in, sending the duo out...

Mario and Mallow get tossed into the Midas River...

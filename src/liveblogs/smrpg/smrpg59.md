We fall into the pipe, leading us to Monstro Town, at the edge of Land's End!

I wonder what we could find here...

[The music has some organ and xylophone in it, but it's a happy tune...](https://youtu.be/4W9oakK-Pkc)

I go into the weapon and armor shop, where a Goomba runs the store! He's a bit shocked for some reason...

He's actually shocked at seeing Bowser!

So the Goomba and Bowser have a history, huh? It's been "ages" since he worked for Bowser. The Goomba just fled to this town because Smithy and his lackeys scared him!

He even has Goombettes of his own! They all greet "Uncle" Bowser hi!

He now sells weapons and armor! He tells Bowser not to be angry at him for leaving him alone... :frowning2:

**Bowser:** ".........Don't worry. I'm not angry with you. I've got new troops now and we're going to reclaim my castle! You go on with your life here. I wish you the best." :slight_smile:

I check the rest of the houses...there's a Toad downstairs, and a Pandorite and a Rat Funk upstairs in one house!

I head into another doorway, into a dojo, where a Terrapin is meditating...

Bowser now comes to meet with the Terrapin, Jagger! They know each other too...

Jagger's been studying under Master Jinx, the head of the dojo.

He ran because he couldn't beat Smithy or his minions either...

Bowser tells Jagger the same thing he told the Goomba shopkeeper.

Now where's an inn?

There's a place to rest provided by the "3 Musty Fears", but no save block...

The third door in the middle of the town is locked...

The exit is at the far right door, where a note says: "**Thanks for stopping by.**"

What a nice town...I like it!

I save at Seaside and stop here.

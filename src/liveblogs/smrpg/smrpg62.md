I go through the cannons, remembering that I launch Mario the moment I hear the bell ring!

On the way to the cliff, Bowser makes it to level 16!

Mario also gets hit with a Funguspike, which turns him into a Mushroom!

I have Mallow heal him, but Mario gets turned into a Scarecrow by a Fink Flower!

Once more into the sand whirlpools...

...and now I'm back at the cliff, where the Sky Troopas have assembled, with Sgt. Flutter at the top of the cliff!

Our "mission," according to Sgt. Flutter, is to climb the cliff by jumping on each shell.

It's basically a moving platform minigame of sorts...

It took me 27.16 seconds to make it up the cliff!

On to Bean Valley!

The aesthetic looks pretty autumnal here, and there are two pipes to go to...which one should I take? I have Mario go to the western one.

But that's a dead end...

With these Stinger battles, Geno gets lucky twice because he has a chance to attack three times in one turn, with these "ONCE AGAIN!" flowers!

Peach reaches level 16 as well! I upgrade her magical stats.

I switch Mallow out with Peach...

...and head into the western pipe in the second area.

In one battle, Peach gets turned into a pink Mushroom!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/IUwEX0B.png" alt="pink mushroom" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

After that battle, Geno reaches level 16! I upgrade his health!

I then head into the southern pipe, which takes us to a place where a chest block is...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/A1KYB5o.png" alt="chest block area" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Inside the chest block is a Flower!

Back to the previous area, and up north, and we're now at an area filled with Piranha Plant-filled pipes!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/E70N8A3.png" alt="piranha plant pipes" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

A Shy Away is guarding the area...

And a save block's up north! I save my progress at this point.

Looks like the Piranha Plants are waking up and biting! It turns out the Shy Away's watering them!

We get into one battle with one Piranha Plant, or a **Smilax**, blocking the pipe ahead!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/MIrDkjF.png" alt="smilax battle" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

We take care of that one immediately, but the Shy Away comes, singing a tune, watering his precious plant! This time, the Piranha Plant has two heads now!

I'm betting we have to face two more heads after these two...

Their usual attacks are Flame and Drain, pretty moderate spells.

After taking care of the heads, the Shy Away comes back with "recycled" water!

My mistake, we're now facing **three** heads!

They can also perform **Pollen Nap** as well...

I have Geno use his **Geno Blast**, Peach her **Group Hug**, and Mario his **Super Jump**!

After taking care of these heads, the Shy Away comes back with more water with nutrients!

Oooooooh boy...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/dAtkGNM.png" alt="megasmilax" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

A **Megasmilax**, or a mega Piranha Plant head's now in the mix!

The smaller plant heads can now attack twice!

The Megasmilax's **Petal Blast** turns everyone into mushrooms! He can also turn one into a Scarecrow!

Thank goodness for Peach, her Group Hug cures everybody!

But the Megasmilax turns everyone into mushrooms again! Now, it's a matter of waiting...

Geno's the first to be cured!

Mario and Peach eventually turn back!

I try using Peach's new **Mute** spell on the Megasmilax, no good!

I manage to have Mario (while he's a scarecrow!) to perform 7 Super Jumps in a row!

Now I have Mario do that again, getting 13 Super Jumps on the Megasmilax!

I also use up my last Able Juice on Peach!

Eventually, the Megasmilax has no FP left!

And with one turn, he's finished!

The Shy Away is not happy that we took care of Smilax...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/jdErrZI.png" alt="shy away scared" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

The Shy Away's now in a bind, fearing for his life! He mentions a **Queen Valentina**, and **Nimbus Land** in passing! His next move: to run away!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DVl631z.png" alt="shy away shys away" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

While flying away, a note drops from the sky!

The note is actually a bag, which contains a **Seed** that I have Mario take!

I have Mario sink into the next pipe, which leads us to an area with a brick block! Knowing how Mario games work, this block probably grows vines out of it!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/tj7FKbW.png" alt="brick block" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

After hitting it, the block freezes, and the beanstalk grows from it!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ArmOlhH.png" alt="beanstalk" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Mario's jumping in shock again!

The narration's in awe too! "**Wow! Did you see that? It's a magical beanstalk! Hit the block once more to climb it.**"

I have Mario hit the block again, and we climb...

...to the skies!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/yl6gnNu.png" alt="clouds" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

I have Mario climb another vine further higher, avoiding the flying red eagle with a pole!

I read a note showing me how to climb the vines from the Nimbus Department (they don't make broomsticks, though!) and proceed.

This is slightly tricky...as I try to gather a few floating coins...

But as I try to reach the blue vine, I get into a battle with the red eagles, and their friend, the **Heavy Troopa**!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/tiyw29e.png" alt="birdy heavy trooper" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

The monsters here are pretty strong, as a **Grinder** attack from a **Birdy** (the red eagle) shows!

The prompt above notes that "Heavy Troopa's ready for launch!" Looks like he's getting ready for an attack... :frowning2:

With Geno's Geno Blast and Mario's 10-jump Super Jump combo, we finish them off!

As I have Mario climb the blue vine, I notice there's another Frog Coin!

Through several attempts, I manage to get the coin!

In the next area now, at the top of the red vine, there's a chest block with a Flower inside!

Now for the gold vine...

I manage to make it higher, but another Frog Coin's floating next to the second gold vine there...

After climbing the second green vine to get the gold coins, Mario falls, and I try again.

The positioning on the vine is important here...and I usually miss reaching the vine...

After a battle with a Birdy, we get an **Energizer**. In their place, a yellow platform appears!

I give up trying to get the second Frog Coin, and climb higher to the third area...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/cMnz36h.png" alt="second vine" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

More vines to climb higher, plus the isometric camera's making it hard for me to tell whether Mario's actually climbing the vine or not...I press on anyways.

By defeating the Birdy and their friends, the platform makes it a bit easier to tell where each vine is....

As I reach higher, [the music changes](https://youtu.be/5LYwswH1bQA)...we seem to be getting somewhere now.

There's a smiling bouncepad on the left, and a bouncepad on the right that can take us back...

I have Mario fall down the hole ahead, where there are two guards blocking the way to the hot spring...

I take the east bounce pad back and save at Monstro Town.

I check around the town. No one's around...

While heading uphill, I see...

...Bowser and his minions! He's frustrated about something...

One of the Goombas tells Bowser that most of their allies have run off, since they're only used to fighting Mario, but not the Smithy Gang...

Bowser's not taking the news too lightly. He's...not going to let Mario find out that he got kicked out of his own castle.

I didn't know Bowser had a reputation to keep...the reputation's probably meant to scare people, sort of like the Dread Pirate Roberts in a way.

He and his minions march away.

Moving west, I see a shaking (or digging?) mole, where she begs for our help, saying that a star fell from the sky and into the mountain, trapping other moles inside the mine!

Another mole comes downhill to help and digs through the wall of the mountain!

I jump up to check out the rest of the mountain, where there's another mole digging from the top.

After talking to her, I rest at the inn, save, and head to the shop next door to get some equipment and items, such as a few **Mid Mushrooms** and **Maple Syrups**.

I also get Mario a new **Punch Glove**, new **Mega** armor for the party (**shirt, cape,** and **pants**), and **Work Pants**.

The Work Pants increase attack, defense, and magical attack, but lowers magical defense...

I also find out just now that the **NokNok Shell**'s a weapon for Mario!

I save again at the inn and head into the mountain...

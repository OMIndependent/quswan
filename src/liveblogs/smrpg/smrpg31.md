In the next room, I see a person with claws and big arms throwing exploding mini Bob-ombs!

I go around past the exploding Bob-ombs, noticing a Yellow Star Piece on the ceiling!

I sneak up behind him, and the battle begins!

**Punchinello:** "Good day. The name's Nello...**PUNCHINELLO!**"

Hello, Punchinello.

**Mallow:** "Punchinello...? Never heard of ya."<br/>
**Punchinello:** "They say I'm a hot head, but I'll show them! You...YOU will make me famous! So long!"

Looks like this guy's probably with the Smithy Gang too...

He has 1075 HP! This is going to be a bit tough...

He summons four Micro Bob-ombs, and one of them explodes in front of Mallow!

Jump attacks have no effect on Punchinello!

After a few hits and a succeeding strategy (using Mallow's Thunderbolt to clear the Micro Bob-ombs, and have Mario and Geno take care of Punchinello), Punchinello begins his second phase! With regular-sized Bob-ombs!

Punchinello directly targets Geno, and he hits heavy!

Now Punchinello blinds everyone with a Sand Storm! Only Mallow and Mario are affected!

After a Geno Beam, Punchinello's losing it at this point!

Is Punchinello getting his lines from The Thing?

After an angry stomp of his feet, huger Bob-ombs drop, Mezzo Bombs!

Out of Flower Points, Punchinello can't cast another Sand Storm anymore!

After more explosions and several attacks, Punchinello is finished...I think...

Nope, he's even more angrier! And he says he's ruined!

**Punchinello:** "I didn't want to do this, but now, I have NO CHOICE!"

Uh oh...

Mallow doesn't believe Punchinello, saying that he's bluffing...

Punchinello tells Mallow to "simmer down, fluffy!"

**Punchinello:** "I'm not going to waste *this* on YOU! Who knows what'll happen?!"

Geno's not afraid! Mario nods, his nonverbal "bring it on!"

Punchinello's build up to his final phase comes, as he stomps the ground!

Nothing's happening...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Kj9Xo3C.png" alt="what the hey" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Punchinello, irritated, keeps stomping the ground until a Big Bob-omb comes crashing down, and crushing Punchinello!

Mallow states the obvious.

**Mallow:** "Mario, if this thing explodes, we're history!"

Geno calls the Big Bob-omb situation "a fine mess"...

Mallow suggests running away! Mario's pondering on what to do...

Then a rock hits the Big Bob-omb, setting it off! Uh oh...

**BOOM!**

Mallow, in soot, along with everyone else, is wondering what that is...

The Big Bob-omb clears out a passage forward into the mines!

**Geno:** "Well, we won the battle. Now I hope we don't lose the war. Where are Dyna and the Star?"

The Star Piece, lodged in the scaffolding above, wedges down from the cracked ceiling to the ground right on cue.

Everyone spins around, almost dizzy, as the Star Piece spins around and around...

We got the third Star Piece!

Let's see what we have so far...

We head into the next passage, where a mole with a bow is trying to push the mine cart out: Dyna.

She asks us for help pushing the cart, which we do.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Und6MpC.png" alt="push the cart" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Mario carries Dyna up into the cart, and I read the warning behind the cart, which are instructions. Looks like it's time for another mini-game!

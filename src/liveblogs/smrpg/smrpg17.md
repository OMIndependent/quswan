All right, time to jump into Mallow's hometown, or pond!

I check around the area, even around Melody Bay, no one's home...

I have Mario stand in front of the stepping stone, and a tadpole comes forth...

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/rlX0qAL.png" alt="tadpole" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Mallow comes out, and the tadpole tells them the whole pond is aware of Mallow's journey with Mario, because they stopped Belome!

**Mallow:** "See, Mario, the waterways of the world bring news to us here. That's why Grandpa knows all the news that's fit to hear!"

The tadpole is surprised at Mario, or "Super Mario", coming to Tadpole Pond, and calls on everyone!

Holy heck! That's a lot of tadpoles!

Mario proves he's the real deal by jumping, and he does it in style!

Mallow and Mario raise their hands up in the air!

**Frogfucius:** "Well, Grasshopper...what's new?"

Mallow tells about how Mario helped them out! Frogfucius knows because of the storm that Mallow made when they were crying...Mallow lowers their head a bit...

Some background talk, and Frogfucius? tells someone to make it look like he's floating...

Enter Frogfucius, Mallow's grandfather, "floating"...

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/731uh6Q.png" alt="frogfucius" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

He says that he's been waiting for Mario.

**Frogfucius:** "Yes, 'Old Wise People' can often give good advice..."

The Lakitu above Frogfucius lowers him a bit...lol...

He orders the tadpoles to form a bridge for Mario to his island.

Mario and Mallow jump to Frogfucius's island.

Frogfucius mentions Smithy at Bowser's castle...but he mentions the "truth" about what's happened with the Princess...

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/HfNKJ68.png" alt="peach not there" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

**Whoa what!?**

Mario reacts quickly and rushes at Frogfucius...

Frogfucius tells him to be patient and to let him explain the situation.

He leaps (!) and lands onto the table in one big crash!

So the sword crashing down into the castle separated Bowser and Peach as well...

He mentions that Smithy's underlings are also running amuck. We took care of Mack...so there are more of the Smithy Gang coming.

Mallow asks Frogfucius about the star piece we found after beating Mack...

Frogfucius says that shooting stars (illogically) "grant wishes", and believes that the **Star Piece** we picked up might be very important to finish off Smithy.

He asks if we want a recap of the whole story. I say yes.

I listen to the sort-of condensed story so far from Frogfucius...and Mallow's now realizing the gravity of the situation...

**Mallow:** "I guess Mack was the first of many, Mario. Some of [the Smithy Gang]'ll make Bowser seem NICE."

Frogfucius tells his grandchild that they will be helping Mario in his quest. Mallow's in shock!

So Frogfucius reveals the truth about Mallow, that Mallow's...

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/49ijlvm.png" alt="say what" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Everyone plus the Lakitu come to the island in a hurry!

[Frogfucius tells his story about how he found Mallow.](https://youtu.be/kbamoPhIanc) So Frogfucius found Mallow from a basket falling from the Midas falls... (music in link)

Mallow takes this news...as lightly as they can...

Mallow starts sniffling...no, Mallow don't cry... :frowning2:

Frogfucius stops that with another jaw-dropping leap! He tells Mallow to go with Mario to find their real family...he then calls to Mario and whispers to him if he'll take Mallow along. Mallow accepts the journey!

Frogfucius tells us to go to **Rose Town** next, and we depart. But, I go back to talk to the wise old frog and he's sniffling...

***Aside:*** While trying to take a screenshot, I accidentally reset the game! Eeeeesafajdfajdfjkls....

He gives us something for the Cricket Pie...he rummages through his chest to gives us the **Froggie Stick**, which I equip on Mallow!

I walk around Frogfucius's island...the banner behind him reads some music scales...

I also have Mario jump on his table. Frogfucius reacts accordingly.

I leap back onto the mainland, and head west to talk to a tadpole, who runs a "Juice Bar". Mario has no membership, so the only thing there is on the menu is a **Froggie Drink**. I buy one, filling up my item bag.

I throw away some Pure Waters, and talk to another tadpole in the Juice Bar's corner, where he heads the shop where I can trade Frog Coins from the Midas River...

Most of the items in stock are stat boosters and speical items. I decide to save up my Frog Coins for later.

Afterwards, I save back at the Midas River.

Honestly, Frogfucius's character did surprise me a bit...

Dyna's excited for the minecart ride!

So I just have to pick up some Mushrooms...I wonder if I get to keep them...

There's also a timer on the upper-left corner of the screen...

I keep crashing at the heard turns and I lose my only Mushroom at one point...

The next phase is a side scroller version of the course, with coins in the mix!

I manage to get a few coins, and I miss plenty of Mushrooms!

On the third part of the ride, I get more Mushrooms, and avoid getting derailed!

Now we're out in the open air, cruising through the mountains!

In the houses below, Ma'Mole and Pa'Mole are waiting, worried about Dyna and Mite...

I'm also having a feeling that they're going to do just that, literally!

Pa'Mole says that they're probably going to use the door like everyone else...

And they do drop in!

Ma'Mole asks Dyna if they're okay.

Dyna says that they're okay, and that she and Mite had fun!

Ma'Mole rushes to where Mite is...

So Dyna was carrying Mite on her back the whole time!

Ma'Mole reprimands Dyna for going into the mines alone, but Pa'Mole tells her that at least that they're safe...

Pa'Mole and Ma'Mole thank Mario again for rescuing Dyna and Mite.

Pa'Mole says to Mario to not worry about the roof, as he'll fix that himself.

Now the adventure continues...where's Mario and friends off to next?

But the narration asks where Peach is, though...

I talk to the moles before setting off. They wish us well, and Pa'Mole tells us not to be strangers.

Dyna wants to go back on the minecart ride again...

I wonder what you win if you beat the minecart minigame?

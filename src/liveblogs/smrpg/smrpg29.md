Alright, I'm back!

***Aside:*** While looking at the Mario wiki, V nppvqragnyyl sbhaq bhg gung Yvax naq Fnzhf znxr pnzrbf va guvf tnzr!

In the meantime, I load up my save state back to the battle with the Crooks!

After beating them, we get another **Flower Tab**...with Croco just passing through!

I chase Croco to the next chamber...

...where I run into two battles, with one of them with another set of Crooks!

I get another Flower Tab after taking care of them, and toss out a Pure Water since the inventory is full.

I take another series of tunnels, leading me to where Pa'Mole is...who's before a dead end.

He asks Mario to find a bomb to blow the walls so we can move forward!

I finally catch up to Croco!

I have Geno use his Beam as the first salvo...

...with Mario's Fire Orb following that!

He seems to have more higher magic defense this time!

After a few more attacks, Croco now responds...

**Croco:** "You want [the coins] back? You've got to take me down first!"

What is he planning?

He lunges straight at Mallow, snatching an item away from us! He then uses his Chomp ability to throw a Rat Funk at Mallow!

Eventually, we finish him off, and he runs away!

We get our stuff, and our coins back, yes!

We also pick up a Bob-omb to clear out the dead end!

I head back to Pa'Mole and give him the Bob-omb...opening a tunnel forward!

Pa'Mole wants to go on ahead with Mario and friends to find the Star, but Mario rapidly shakes his head no.

Pa'Mole realizes that he wouldn't be helping Mario and friends if he came along. Mario nods in agreement, and Pa'Mole runs off back to town to tell Ma'Mole.

Instead of heading further into the tunnel, I follow suit.

I meet up with Pa'Mole again on the way back, but he can't find a way out since the cliff back up is too high for him to reach. He tells us to rescue Dyna and Mite...

I jump on the stacked crates and up to the cliff, going back out to town.

I save at the Moleville inn, and head back to the Rose Town inn gb gel naq svaq Yvax...ur'f abg gurer nalzber... :frowning2:

Heading back, I buy **Cymbals** for Mallow, hoping that they bring a clash to the quiet of battle...

I head back to the Tower to follow Booster in the passage he went through, but I can't go any further!

We'll have to take the long way up...

On the climb up, some Bob-ombs are walking in squares on the steps. The Bob-ombs' palette look different in the tower...

...because they're **Rob-ombs!**

Their attacks are mostly run-and-self-destruct!

I see you hiding behind those curtains, Booster! Don't try to run! But he runs away!

Instead of following him, though, I head to the middle passage, where there's a chest block...

I fail to have Mario get the chest block and fall down. Mario lands at the seesaw room where the Bob-omb is!

Climbing up again, I get into another encounter where I face another monster called a **Remo Con**...

After a battle, Geno levels up and learns **Geno Boost!**

I increase Geno's health!

After another battle, Mario levels up too, and I increase his attack and defense!

I fail at my second attempt at getting the chest block...

On the way to my third try at the chest block, Mallow levels up too, and I give an attack and defense bonus to Mallow!

I also manage to succeed on a timed hit with Bowser!

On the fifth try, I jump on the seesaw, sending the Bob-omb flying up and away!

The moment the Bob-omb comes down...

...I gain a big enough boost to hit the chest block, which contains a **Masher**, or an upgraded Hammer!

Then, another falling noise occurs...

...the Masher from the chest falls and hits Mario on the head!

Mario recovers from the blow and I stop here!

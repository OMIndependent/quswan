<a href="https://youtu.be/2CmfDbZ6j08">Here's the music for Midas River.</a>

Toad now appears and gives us a tutorial for this course.

So this is a coin scoring game...I can move Mario left or right and, for only a while, can push up against the river's flow. There are also traps along the way down the falls, but Toad's not telling what they are. Oh, Toad...

Now Mario falls to the base of the waterfall, and lands on a barrel, where Toad explains the "barrel jumping" part of the course.

Toad tells us to watch out for fish because I'll lose coins if I bump into one!

After that fast minigame, Mario jumps onto land, and lands on top of a Blue Toad!

We got 35 coins from the Midas River!

I can trade Midas River coins for Frog Coins, but how much for each?

So **60 coins = 1 Frog Coin**...

I don't have enough...

The blue Toad gives us a **NokNok Shell** for luck!

I save here.

So the trampoline is used to go back to the top of the Midas River, with 30 coins as the fee for another go. Hmmm...

I backtrack to the Kero Sewers before heading out to Tadpole Pond to get that last chest block in the chamber filled with Boos.

The water's flooded the sewers once again...

Noticed that the Hobgoblin's **Elegy** sounds like a macabre rendition of FÃ¼r Elise...

<a href="http://bit.ly/2v0cFHz">I checked a map of Kero Sewers online</a>, and it turns out I have to take a pipe from a place called Ynaq'f Raq in order to get that chest!

After getting into the pipe leading to Belome's chamber, it's time for the Midas River minigame again!

Finishing that round on the Midas, I manage to get enough for one Frog Coin. I also noticed that it's not 60 coins anymore, but **80 coins** to get a Frog Coin!

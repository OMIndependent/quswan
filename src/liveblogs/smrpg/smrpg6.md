Let's see where I left off...

After leaving the inn, I talk to the cloud person, who's still crying...

The cloud person notices that Mario's soaking wet, and stops crying, with the rain stopping too...

They also forgot the reason why they cried, oh my god! 

Mario falls flat on his face!

The person tells us about why they came in to town, to buy something for their Grandpa. Then, the crocodile stole their coin...

A nearby Toad stops by and asks how we're going to take care of Bowser...I jump in response.

The cloud person's in shock and awe that Mario's in their presence!

The cloud person, or frog, introduces themselves as **Mallow**, from **Tadpole Pond**.

They mention that they can't jump!

They ask if I'm willing to help catch the crocodile thief. I say yes!

Hooray! I get a new ally!

Before I head back to Seaside, I double check the guest room to see if that certain person is there. They're not...

I head up to the Princess's room, where her grandma is doubling for her while she's away.

Peach thanks her for all that she did for her...

Grandma tells Peach to see the world, make friends, and destroy Smithy.

Peach says since that Mario's with her, everything will be all right...awww...

She bids her grandma well and the grandma turns back into the Princess...

Now, back to business.

The Elder and his "citizens" greet us the moment we head into town, with a gleeful smile on his face...I knew this wasn't going to be good...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/8PuS7ot.png" alt="elder hee" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

**"Elder":** "But your journey ends here. You are so gullible. Don't you know who I am?"

The facade is removed as he reveals himself to be one of Smithy's gang members, **Yaridovich!**

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gVqSRsq.png" alt="yaridovich intro" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

He says "his impersonation of an ordinary person was flawless." That's questionable...

Yaridovich wants to win Smithy's good graces, or "brownie points," and in order to do that, he has to get the fifth Star Piece back to him!

I have Mario tell him to shove off.

He responds as I expected he would, but he throws in one snag: the actual inhabitants of Seaside Town!

One of Yaridovich's cronies scurries into the west house, and gets one of the citizens in there!

Oh my god! Did he actually...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/rT3mWMw.png" alt="ack" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

**Yaridovich:** "Now isn't it a shame for an innocent old man to be tickled...like this?" Lol...

But, I have no other choice but to give him the Star Piece, since it's a "but thou must" scenario...

I have Mario willingly give it up!

Yaridovich thinks of himself very highly...with labels like "genius", and very "important".

He and his goons scurry west...

The door to the west house is locked!

I have Mario pursue Yaridovich!

Blade, Yaridovich's ride, however, is late.

Yaridovich notices Mario, and tries to swim away!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/uRjfPIq.png" alt="johnny jumps" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

**Johnny! Yes!**

Johnny threatens to make Yaridovich walk the plank for stealing the Star Piece, and for trying to get away, from Mario!

One of Johnny's Bandana Blues tells him to let Mario do the work of taking care of Yaridovich.

Yaridovich, you're surrounded!

But, he has a trick up his sleeve!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/JM1a7Ou.png" alt="group formation" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Yaridovich and his "Toads" form up into their true form!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DV6vTdq.png" alt="yaridovich true" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

He looks like a spear...<a href="https://youtu.be/UQl7wDCKXSM">and the boss battle music sounds different this time!</a>

Yaridovich's opening move is a **Water Blast!**

Scanning Yaridovich, he's worried about his reputation: "**My promotion's at stake!**"

I try Bowser's new move, which does little damage to him!

Yaridovich now casts **Flame Stone**, which is a Meteor spell on one target!

After attacking him a bit, he performs his **Mirage** move!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Z8S1L9N.png" alt="yarid double" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Now which one to hit?

Using Mallow's Thunderbolt, the one with the highest defense might be the real one...

Yaridovich's normal attack is him putting his head onto the spear he's wielding and using it!

Eventually, the doubles merge back into one again!

I use up one turn healing everyone from Yaridovich's spells!

Bowser and Mario's attacks seem to vary in damage!

Yaridovich performs his Mirage move again!

I have Mallow Thunderbolt to find the real Yaridovich!

With Mallow as healer, and Mario and Bowser as offense, we finish off Yaridovich!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/pcbgiRK.png" alt="victory" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Peach also goes up to level 13, where she learns **Come Back**! I'm guessing this is her **Life** or **Raise** spell. I increase her magic stats!

Geno also gains a level! I boost his physical stats!

Looks like the narration is now aware that Smithy wants the Star Pieces!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/aMRdZOZ.png" alt="star pieces want" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

"**What horrible surprises might he have in store for Mario?**"

<a href="https://youtu.be/UV3-Td33-7A">The music's now changed back to the actual Seaside Town music!</a>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/SVDrv9i.png" alt="yarid key" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

While heading back, I notice Yaridovich dropped a key! It's the key to open the house where the citizens are locked up!

There's also a note hanging from one of the trees!

I have Mario read it:

"<strong>To Mario,

Knowin' you, it must've been a breeze knocking down Yarid, eh? By the way, my pirates say they saw a huge AX flyin' across the sky. It's probably one of Smithy's friends. Go get him, pal! Well, my gills are failing on me, so I'll be headin' back down. Drop in whenever you have time, okay?

Your true mate<br/>
Jonathan "Johnny" Jones</strong>"

Awwww... :slight_smile:

I have Mario unlock the house and free the real citizens of the town!

All of the citizens including a mole thank us for rescuing them.

Now the Elder talks to Mario: he mentions his little "torture" from one of Yaridovich's cronies, but says it's nothing to worry about...he rewards us with a **Flower Jar!**

I admit I spoiled myself earlier in that if I were to continue refusing Yaridovich, he would've had the real Elder tickled to the point that if we rescued him, he would have rewarded Mario with just a coin!

I wonder what prize I would've won from the real Elder if I handed over the Star Piece immediately?

<p><h2 class="entry-title">Super Mario RPG - Part 55a: Back to Meeting the Special Someone</h2></p>

I head back to the Mushroom Kingdom palace, where a Toad tells me a guest is resting.

Yep, she's here! It's her, **Samus Aran!**

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/oPncGQw.png" alt="samus sleeping" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

**Samus:** "......I'm resting up for Mother Brain."

Lucky that's done, now we go back to Seaside and find out more about the ax flying in the sky...

Too bad I just missed the other cameo in this game...oh well.

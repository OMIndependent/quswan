Into Rose Town we go!

As we enter, a Toad gets struck by a mysterious arrow! He tells us that the arrow came from the forest, and can't move once he's been struck!

Another Toad tells us that the arrows have been falling since a shooting star hit near the town...hmmm...it must be one of the Smithy Gang again.

After we talk, she also gets struck by an arrow!

I head into the big house behind her...there's a Toad playing with toy lookalikes of Mario, Bowser, and Peach...

"Bowser" pummels "Mario" to the wall!

Mario's jumping in shock! Lol...

But the Toad sees the actual Mario and calls his mom to tell her guests have arrived.

The Toad doesn't believe Mario's here, so I have Mario jump, his trademark pose!

The Toad asks us if we want to play "Save the World" with him.

The Toad, named **Gaz**, is told by his mother that Mario might be tired.

Mario accepts and Gaz gives him the role of "Bowser", while Gaz is "Geno".

Mario takes his role very seriously here...

**Gaz:** "Better watch out, Bowser, 'cause Geno's going to blow you away! Take this!"

"Geno" lunges at "Bowser"!

"Bowser" counters!

"Geno" performs his "super duper...custom patented, **one and only,** ***SHOOTING STAR SHOT!***"

Holy heck!

Gaz accidentally missed and hits Mario instead! He gets dizzy...and falls...

Whoa, what's this?

A little shooting star hovers around the toys...the star bounces on top of them, and lands on "Geno"!

**Geno comes to life!**

Geno walks around in the dark, and leaves!

The next morning, Mario's sleeping, and I wake him up! I see a save block and stop here.

I later found out from a map online that the last clue came from the room before the password room. The clue only came down if I pressed the two green switch pads at the same time!

Just for fun, I try to hit both switch pads in the room before heading deeper into the ship...

I accidentally drop a stray barrel to the floor, and I have Mario roll it to one of the switch pads and have Mario press the other one.

Nothing happens. Is it because I defeated the giant Blooper earlier?

Into the depths we go!

I avoid the Dry Bones and jump a stack of crates to get to the upper deck's door forward.

In the next chamber, I see a set of cannons firing Bullet Bills with Alley Rats on top of them!

I pick a fight with an Alley Rat to stop the cannon from firing, no good.

I make it past the brigade of firing cannons and head downstairs into another mini maze of crates, where chest blocks are floating atop of them!

There's a small gap in the wall of crates that's too small to cross over...

I head to the door, where I'm greeted by a double Mario!

I cross into the next passage...

Well, that was interesting!

I get into another fight with a Dry Bones group. It turns out that to take care of a Dry Bones, I have to use fire, or Pure Water. Physical attacks don't do anything to them!

Peach also gains a level! I upgrade her health.

Geno does too! I upgrade his physical stats!

And I get into another round with the resurrected Dry Bones!

Like in the old games, a jump attack also takes out the Dry Bones!

Two "**LUCKY!**" flowers for Mallow!

I head down the stairs after beating the Dry Bones, where I get a mushroom from a chest block that restores our health, and a save block!

I check a map online to see if I missed anything...I turn back to fetch the remaining chest blocks in this area.

After stumbling upon two battles along the way, I make it on top of the crates!

The pair of chest blocks above the stack of J crates both have 10 big coins, or 100 coins!

In the room with the Mario double, I reveal a cleverly hidden J block, and a hidden chest block!

Using Mario's double, I get the chest block, which has a KeroKero Cola!

Bye, Mario Double, and thanks for the help!

Phew, I almost get into **another** battle with Dry Bones's crew!

I use the stairway and crates to make it to the other side of the room, where a chest block lies!

Taking a deep breath, I open the chest block, which has a mimic monster, a **Hidon!**

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/yJHEWQp.png" alt="hidon" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

The Hidon has a Piranha Plant inside, chomping Mallow!

Let's see what some fireballs do...

...nothing!

Now the Hidon summons **Goombettes**, or [**Micro Goombas**](http://mariowiki.com/Micro_Goomba), to the fray!

I use Bowser's Terrorize attack, which only does moderate damage!

Lucky the Goombettes aren't much of a threat to Bowser, but to Mallow, they are!

Using Bowser's Chain Chomp and Mario's jump, we finish off the Hidon!

The Goombettes follow suit!

We get a **Safety Badge**, which prevents any poison or silence on the wearer!

I have Mallow equip the Safety Badge, and jump back to save before heading forward.

It looks like we're getting into the deeper end of the ship now...

I go into the next door, where a whirlpool is, and I have Mario dive into the whirlpool.

Carefully avoiding the green Cheep Cheeps, I collect the four Frog Coins in the submerged previous area, and head to the door forward.

In the next room, I get into a battle with the starfish, a **Zeostar**, and its tougher looking friends, **Crusty** and **Leuko**!

The Leuko's spell, **Solidify**, is a freeze! And its **Static E!** is a bit shocking!

But the Leuko has low physical defense!

Mario levels up to 13, where I boost his magical stats!

It seems I'm almost out of FP too...

I get into another battle with the green Cheep Cheep, or a group of **Mr. Kippers**!

Scanning Mr. Kipper, his mind says that he's "a very fresh fish."

Mallow levels up too!

More battles to go on the way down...and I meet our first **Blooper**!

Looks like the Yoshi shell game also takes XP if I pick the wrong egg!

It's also the first time in battle that I have Mario heal Bowser, I think?

In the next room, there's Blooper and three tiny Bloopers, along with a secret door hidden behind barrels!

I pick up a **Safety Ring**, which prevents any instant KOs!

I give Mario the ring, which boosts his defenses a bit.

I wonder if there's any way to jump back to the surface here?

Reading the map again, I then have Mario climb the barrel stacks back to solid land! Then, I have him swim to the other corner in the room to fetch the lone Frog Coin there!

In the next room, there's pirates, and they're all sharks!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/nZLdVBU.png" alt="who are you" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

**Pirate:** "What? You're lookin' fer a STAR? I'll let ya see stars, arr harr harr!"

Another pirate tells us that anything that falls into the sea belongs to "Johnny."

And they're not letting us pass without a fight!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/cxIKe3e.png" alt="bandana red" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

They're easy pickings! We overpower them to the point where the last one runs away!

Bowser gains enough XP to reach level 13! I increase his physical stats even further!

The pirate sharks now know our strength and alert their upper deck mates!

I hit the chest block, which contains a mushroom that restores our health and flowers!

Upstairs bound, pirate sharks come down, spears at the ready, accidentally stomping over Mario on the way down!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/s1ng3rO.png" alt="mario runover" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

They think they scared him off, but give a double take and make chase!

We're surrounded!

But the pirate sharks at the top of the stairs throw a barrel, where Mario ducks and bowls over their fellow crewmates instead!

We climb the stairs where five pirate sharks greet us!

They're also easy wins! But Mallow takes the most damage from them! :frowning2:

They let us through to see their leader, Johnny.

After saving at the inn (which costs 15 coins for a night), we do more wandering around the town a bit...

The weapons shop list is really huge!

I buy a **Troopa Shell**, a **Parasol**, a **Chomp Shell** (a Kinklink Chain), a **Double Punch** (or a Double Rocket Punch), and a **Ribbit Stick**.

I check out the armor shop, which has most of the familiar armor plus the Sailor stuff...

After selling the NokNok (Koopa) Shell, I leave the shop.

I head into the next shop, Beetles Are Us, which is a pretty interesting shop. It's run by a Snifit, and it has the pricing list for beetles on the wall.

I have the Snifit explain.

So all I need to do is to get a Beetle Box, which 50 coins. Then, I have to get beetles from Booster Hill, where I can trade them in for coins, or in this case, Frog Coins if I get a golden one!

Next stop: Accessory Shop!

The wares are mostly items that we've gotten from chests, so I don't buy them...

I head over to the next stop, the Mushroom Boy shop! He mentions special mushrooms...hmmm...he will give us special items if we get these "special" mushrooms...but he needs to taste one to see if it is special or not.

The next shop we head to is the health shop run by the mole! The wares are recovery items!

I have Mario buy a few stuff and head out.

After seeing Frogfucius, who tells me to head back to Seaside Town, we go back and stop by the Elder's House.

We don't have enough Frog Coins for the Coin Trick... :frowning2:

I have Mario talk to the Elder.

The Elder suggests looking in a town at the "far side of '**Land's End**'," where its inhabitants are "reformed" enemies...

He then mentions a mouse who mentions a star...

So **Land's End** and the town there is our next stop!

Save early and save often!

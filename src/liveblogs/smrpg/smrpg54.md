I was thinking of switching Peach for Mallow, but I decide against it, since I learned that most of these monsters are weak against thunder and fire spells!

After saving way back before the stack of J crates, we confont Johnny.

Before I leave the save room, I open the chest block where I found the Safety Badge, which now contains 10 big coins, or 100 coins total!

Okay, now it's time to face Johnny!

There's Johnny and his sharks in blue...I wonder what Johnny's drinking?

He underestimates Mario immediately.

He claims that the Star Piece fell into the sea, therefore it's his, and to get it, we have to fight him for it!

The **Bandana Blues**, Johnny's crew and personal guard, strike first!

I'm now thinking I should have bought **Sailor Pants** for Mallow before fighting Johnny and his pirates!

We take care of half of the Bandana Blues before focusing attacks on Johnny!

I use Mallow's new ability on Johnny. It's mildly effective on him...

Johnny now uses **Get Tough!** to literally toughen himself up! He turns red as a result!

I have Mario use up the last Bad Mushroom in the inventory to poison Johnny!

He's now more harder to hit!

Scanning Johnny, his mind feels resigned (?) to his fate: "**Whoa! It's all over.**"

I take care of the third Bandana Blue.

Eventually, we also finish off the last minion!

Now Johnny laughs!

**Johnny:** "Not bad, fellas. How 'bout it, Mario? **Mario versus me!** Wanna mix it up?"

Mario jumps twice, accepting the challenge!

Now it's a one-on-one match, with Mario vs. Johnny!

Mallow and Bowser cheer for Mario, and Johnny's two Bandana Blue minions start rooting for their captain!

Lucky I had Johnny near KO'd before taking him on, since it takes three attacks from Mario to finish him!

I get prompted for another shell game since I picked up a "LUCKY!" flower from one of the Bandana Blues. I'm not risking my rewards at this point...

Johnny congratulates us for our victory, and offers us the Star Piece!

**Yes!!!**

Here are the Star Pieces we have so far:

Johnny goes to the porthole window, probably still a bit...mournful about his loss to us...he tells us to leave before he changes his mind. We do so.

The Bandana Blue tells us a bounce pad back to the surface is in the next room.

I save at the sea cavern before heading back to town.

Honestly, Johnny was easier than I expected. Probably it was because I took care of his Bandana Blue crewmates gradually rather than at once...

**Five Star Pieces!!!** Oh my god!!! Two more to go!

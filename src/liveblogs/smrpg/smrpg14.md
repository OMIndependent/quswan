While shopping for more stuff, I take a look at what the **Trueform Pin** does: when equipped, it prevents the person who wears it from getting turned into a mushroom or a scarecrow...

I equip the **Antidote Pin** for Mallow, and the **Trueform Pin** for Mario. I also check the rest of the menu. I still have that **Cricket Pie**, and the **Star Piece**.

At the entrance to the sewer, I use the Flower Jar, and jump in!

Save early and often!

I avoid the jumping Goby out of water as I sink into the northeastern pipe...

Out of curiosity, I jump in the middle of the Rat Funk's circle...

The Hobgoblin uses **Dark Claw** to poison Mario!

Turns out I can use Able Juice as an antidote...

Out of one battle and into another...

Boos can use **Lightning Orb** as their special ability!

I use Mallow's new ability to see how much health they have...

**Shadow: 85 HP<br/>
Boo: 43 HP**

Mario gets a "DEFENSE UP" flower!

There's a lot of Rat Funks scurrying about in here...

In one battle, an **Elegy** from a monster silences Mario!

The only way forward would be to get into that green pipe, but it's submerged underwater...

Another thing I just discovered: if I press Y (or square) at the right time using Mallow's **Scan**-like ability, I can also read the enemy's mind!

In one battle, I get lucky and have two "ONCE AGAIN" flowers in a row for Mario!

After sinking into another pipe, I'm now in the next area. There's a lot of Boos here...

I accidentally jump on the bouncepad, taking me back outside!

I heal the party and jump back in the sewers, saving on the way...

I'm back at the Boo's area, where I step on the pulsing green switch, which drains the sewer water.

Into the once submerged pipe, I see chest blocks, more Boos, and a save block.

In one of the chest blocks is a Mushroom, healing everyone!

I save and stop here.

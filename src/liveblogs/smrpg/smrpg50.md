We leave Seaside Town and head out into the sea!

[The music here's the same dungeon music from Kero Sewers.](https://youtu.be/rMKNkR60YcQ)

I drop down from a stack of crates and have Mario talk to a mysterious hooded figure...

He sells a variety of stuff new and old, such as weapons like a **Super Hammer** for Mario, and the **Hurly Gloves** for Bowser. Other wares included Sailor equipment for everyone, and a **Nautical Dress** for Peach.

I get some Able Juices and sell the Wake Up Pin.

The hooded guy tells me more stuff as to why there's a Sunken Ship. A giant squid sunk it! He adds that some people went into investigate but never came back... :frowning2:

In the room behind him, there's a save block, and treasure blocks behind a stack of crates.

I save here before heading out.

I head back into the shop and take the south passage, where more crates and a bunch of starfish are lying down...

I hit the chest block, which has a Star in it! Using the star, I knock off most of the starfish blocking the way back!

After wearing out the Star's power, and knocking most of the starfish away, Peach gains a level! I upgrade her magic power!

I slowly proceed onward, not wanting to touch, or wake up the starfish...

Now in the next cavern, there's a whirlpool to take us underwater, a chest block high on a ledge above, and the passage south...

Taking the south passage, we're now outside, at the edge of the ocean...

I have Mario head back into the cave, and swim in to the whirlpool, which allows him to walk underwater!

Once inside the tunnel, a burst of pressure pushes Mario up to the surface...

...and we're now at the ledge where the chest block is!

The chest block contains a **Max Mushroom**, which recovers all health! Now this is an item I need to use sparingly!

I have Mario jump into the whirlpool outside, avoiding contact with the Blooper.

We sink into a pipe-sized opening, above the remains of a ship's mast...

...and we're now inside the **Sunken Ship**! [Here's the music for the level.](https://youtu.be/Nk-VKQVJ_U0)

There's floating masked spectres, or **Greapers**, above our heads, vanishing and appearing at will, in the next room!

The Greapers are quick, using Deathsickle (which lowers the accuracy of the target), and a Lightning Orb as their opening moves!

Their partner, the **Reacher**, is a powerhouse himself!

Geno gains a level, and I boost his health!

There's more Dry Bones and haunting Greapers in the next room, along with a note posted on the wall!

The note is a travel log, which tells us to find 6 hints, which are written by different people.

Another monster called the **Straw Head** also joins the fray!

At the next hall, there's more red rats, or **Alley Rats**, patrolling the staircase...

I use half of my Honey Syrup supply before starting the descent.

**Gorgons** are also part of the Alley Rats' party as well! And they're powerful too!

At another battle, Mario levels up! So does Mallow!

I increase Mario's health, and Mallow's magical stats!

Aaaaahhh, these battles are endless!

I manage to escape that one and make it to the bottom deck at the staircase, and collect  the chest block, which has 10 coins!

After reading a map online, I turn back and head to the save block on the ship, which is at the door to the right in the room where we entered!

Before I do that, I switch Peach for Mallow, and have him heal Mario.

On the way back, I pick up a Flower at a corner behind a stack of J crates!

Also, I notice a note, which reads:

"**The door to the cellar is locked with a password consisting of 6 letters. In order to proceed, you'll have to decipher the password using the 6 hints.**"

After saving at the room, I find another note:

"**We've managed to trap the giant squid in the treasure cellar. The treasure will sink with the ship but...so it goes!**"

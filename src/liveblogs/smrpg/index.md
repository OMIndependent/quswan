[*Super Mario RPG*][smrpg] is a video game developed as a joint production between Square and Nintendo, and released on the Super Famicom in Japan on March 9, 1996. The game is later shipped to North America under the name *Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars* on May 13, 1996 for the Super Nintendo, later overshadowed by the release of the Nintendo 64 console, and its flagship title *Super Mario 64* on September of that same year.

A remake of the game premiered for the Nintendo Switch on November 17, 2023. This version covers the original SNES release.

I played through this game from **July 19, 2017** to **December 23, 2017**.

Inside, I see a worried Ma'Mole...she leaves, probably to dig from the outside into the mines.

The way into the mines, according to the other two moles, is blocked. They're wishing Mario would come and help out...

I wonder how these moles know about Mario...

The moles turn around, and see Mario!

I let Mario say that he knows the story, and that we'll help!

With the moles' help, I have Mario jump up and head into the mines!

Inside, I get into another battle, mistaking a **Magmite** for a rock, with their other friends, a **Bob-omb** and a **Sparky!**

The Magmite's got very strong defense!

Mario levels up, and I give him more attack power.

Along the way, I get into more battles, especially with **Clusters**, who use Crystal, and they self-destruct, taking out Geno!

I give Mallow more health as a level up bonus.

There's a greedy Toad who's looking for a rare item here and wants to sell it!

I jump down and follow the sign arrows...

Now, which way should I go?

I go west first, but double-back east out of curiosity, where that part is caved in...

The bounce spring probably could take me back...

**Probably not!** Mario hits his head on the cave ceiling, and falls unconscious...

**Croco!** So the bounce spring was a trap...

He and his minions take all of our coins!

Croco jumps on Mario before he and his cronies run east!

I pursue them, where they're now at the dead end...but Croco pulls out a Bob-omb from his bag! He uses it to destroy the rubble, and runs off, with his minions following suit!

On the way, I meet an **Enigma**, who uses Echofinder to block special attacks!

Geno levels up, where I increase his magical attack and defense!

While chasing Croco, I find some hiding Crooks, and try to take care of them, but some of them run away!

He didn't have the coins, but we get a **Flower Tab** after fighting him!

I find another set of Crooks, hiding behind the bounce spring!

However, my controller runs out of power! jfhashhglhquiehygeru,jbzdhbjgerajghiueruhligeurb!

Using the keyboard, I save my progress into a save state, and switch off the game! For some reason, the game easily overheats my Raspberry Pi at times, slowing the game down too!

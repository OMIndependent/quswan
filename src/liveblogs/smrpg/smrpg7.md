I talk to a blue cap Toad and he says that the crocodile also stole his wallet!

I look at Mallow's stats...they can do a **Thunderbolt** as a special move!

I head into the shop...and it seems that the shopkeeper knows Mallow!

The shopkeeper knows what Mallow wants, since Mallow's Grandpa, Frogfucius, told him everything. But Mallow tells the shopkeeper their coin was stolen, and says that Mario's helping out to find the coin!

The shopkeeper gives us a **Pick Me Up** (which resurrects KO'd allies) before we leave!

I head downstairs in the storeroom and talk to the Stand Before Me Toad and head out where a Toad guard is jumping up and down!

Toad says that he saw someone go past him!

Mallow asks if that person looked like the purple crocodile that Mario imitates!

Toad says yes! Mallow asks why Toad didn't stop the crocodile?

Lol!

Mario and Mallow fall flat on their faces!

Looks like the crocodile is about to escape with more ill-gotten loot. The crocodile's name is Croco!

He dashes past Mallow, Mario, and Toad!

Mallow wants to chase after him!

I save at the inn first before heading out!

***Aside:*** I wonder if Mario falling flat on his face constitutes as this game's version of a facepalm?

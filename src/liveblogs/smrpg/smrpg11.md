With a few Shy Guys taken care of, I head into the throne room...

**...oh my god!**

So the Shy Guys have found "a new home" to bounce around to all day!

But the Shy Guys spot us ("**NOT SO FAST PAL**"), they bounce on Mario, and some...thing that looks a bit similar to the Smithy Gang sword is before the throne.

So this is their leader, or probably the one that lured the Shy Guys over to the palace...

He does a huge bouncing leap, which shakes the throne room!

His name is **Mack**, who tells the Shy Guys that we're crashing their party!

I notice there's a floating blue Star behind the throne as well...

As the Shy Guys taunt us, we begin the fight!

After I have Mallow cast Thunderbolt, Mack is stunned for a turn!

Mack's bodyguards were easy to take care of...

Mack throws a **Flame** at Mallow.

Mack pulls a **Flame Wall** move, hitting the entire party!

So Mack's a fire-based attacker...

Oh no, more Bodyguards come to Mack's aid!

Mack's jumping! Thinking that the move Mack's performing is similar to the *Final Fantasy* **Jump** attack, I have everyone defend!

For some reason, Mack hasn't landed yet...

After Thunderbolting the Bodyguards, Mack lands...with reinforcements!

So more Bodyguards come after all of their friends are down...

Mack has no Flower Points left! He jumps out of the way!

After taking care of the Bodyguards, he comes back with more firepower!

But he's down after a few specials from Mario and Mallow!

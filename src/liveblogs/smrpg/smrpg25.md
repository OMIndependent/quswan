Out of curiosity, I go into the **Pipe Vault** instead of west to **Moleville**...

<a href="https://youtu.be/pZymRkK3898">Here's the music for the Pipe Vault. It's a remix of the same cave music from the original *Super Mario Bros.*</a>

I have Mario sink into the pipe in the first area, which leads to a tunnel with lava...

I accidentally steer Mario into the hot lava, where he leaps away, his butt in smoke!

After a few failed attempts, with careful timing on the platforms, and while avoiding the fiery fireballs, I make it.

In the next chamber, a narrow one-tile wide hall, I see a Goomba. Leaping past him, I jump on the flight of stairs...

...but a Thwhomp lands, rolling Mario off!

I jump up the stairs and encounter another Goomba with more Piranha Plants popping out of pipes beyond.

Geno's Finger Shot finished off the Goomba with 140 damage!

After the battle, I sink into the pipes, and collect coins in the next hall, save for a Frog Coin wedged in an unreachable part of the wall...

I have Mario jump, where a yellow platform appears! I also get a chest block with a Flower inside!

Using the bounce spring pad, I'm now back at the previous hall...

With care, I head to the pipe at the far end...

I see more brick stacks with Goombas at the bottom of each gap below...

At the other side, a red pipe with a Piranha Plant is sticking out.

In the next hall, more red pipes with Baby Piranha Plants and Piranha Plants, ready to finish me!

With the baby Piranha Plants, they take my coins instead of leading me into another battle!

In the next hall, I get a Flower from a chest block, and jump to get the next chest block in between a bed of baby Piranha Plants, which I fall into!

The chest block only has more coins, which I end up losing because of the chomping plants below...

After another battle, I head to the exit pipe.

I'm back at the surface, where the music sounds different.

I save at the nearby save block there before going forward.

The save progress bar tells me I'm at **Yo'ster Isle...**

I use the map to get my bearings...

So going through the Pipe Vault led me to Yo'ster Isle...

I save again and stop here, since my Raspberry Pi's heating up again.

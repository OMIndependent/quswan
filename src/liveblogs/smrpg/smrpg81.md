I just realized after reading a few guides online that I could have finished Exor off with one **Geno Whirl!** Aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!!!!!

For anyone who's still around reading these, thank you for staying till the end, and for **not** spoiling me about that part, or any others!

I also remembered that I asked this question at the start of the game:

*I wonder, is [Exor] the sword itself the Smithy Gang, or is the sword like a gatekeeper or messenger of the actual Smithy Gang?*

It turns out my second guess was sort of right! Exor's literally both a gate for Smithy's troops to enter the Mushroom Kingdom, and a gatekeeper to Smithy's dimension!

Now back to the action...

Left, left, straight, right is the way to get to those secret treasures in the Forest Maze...

I also pick up some treasures from Surprise Blocks along the way...

In the middle of my Surprise Block search, I fight more battles, involving Buzzers and an Amanita...

After saving, we now go into the actual maze!

Hmmm, this isn't right...I'm not going in the right direction...

I check a map of the maze to check my bearings...

...after trying again, I make it!

Now I have Mario sink into the log to see what's there...

Treasures galore!

I use up a syrup and toss out a few items before getting the loot!

One Frog Coin, three Mushrooms, and a Flower are what we get!

I head back...

On the way back, I get another Frog Coin from a Surprise Block, and a KeroKero Cola from another!

I save at Nimbus Land, since I'm heading to Barrel Volcano next...

[I search a map online for the Barrel Volcano](https://www.mariouniverse.com/wp-content/img/maps/snes/smrpg/nl-barrelvolcano.png), and look through it. The only things that I missed here are Frog Coins...

And I use up one of the KeroKero Colas here...

While a bunch of Pyrospheres chase me, I get the Frog Coin from the lava! Poor Mario, though...

For the next area, I make it to the other side, head into the tunnel, and go back to use the lava to bounce Mario up to the ledge where the next Frog Coin is!

I save at the midpoint and continue onwards.

After countless battles in the volcano, I rest at Hinopio's and exit out!

On the way out, Mario, Bowser, and Mallow level up!

My god, there's a lot of steps to jump up to!

Next stop: Monstro Town!

<p><h2 class="entry-title">Super Mario RPG - Part 81a: Culex, Take Two</h2></p>

Let's see if I have the strength to face Culex once more, or at least, survive him longer!

The game doesn't recognize that I didn't take on Culex last time, and the intro with **Culex, Dark Knight of Vanda**, begins again...

**Culex:** "**You will enter combat against me?**"

**I do.**

Culex repeats his monologue, [and round two with Culex is on!](https://youtu.be/12rOdMEDP4o)

I have the party strike the Fire Crystal first!

But, the crystals are a bit too quick and too strong for us!

They're even a bit too much for Bowser, as he's KO'd!

Culex unleashes Shredder, I'm thinking that this spell dispels our bonus buffs!

I have Mario resurrect Bowser!

I have Peach heal the party.

Now both Mario and Bowser are down!

And after using up one turn reviving Mario, the party's finished!

<p><h2 class="entry-title">Super Mario RPG - Part 81b: Jinx, Take One</h2></p>

I decide to face off against **Jinx** in his dojo.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/HV1hfr8.png" alt="you wish to challenge" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Yes, I do!

**Jinx:** "All right, let's see what you're capable of."

Now the fight begins against Jinx!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/C9m2wnr.png" alt="jinx boss" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Jinx does a **Triple Kick**, bowling Mario back!

I use all of the party's brute force against Jinx! He's amazed at our skill!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/MewiAMG.png" alt="AMAZING!" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

The battle ends!

**Jinx:** "I guess I underestimated you. You pack quite a punch! But don't let it go to your head, because I let you have that round. Let's have a rematch."

Knowing that Jinx is holding back, I challenge him for the second time, but just this once...

The second round against Jinx begins!

Jinx Triple Kicks and Quicksilvers Bowser!

Jinx has gotten a bit stronger than in the first round...

I keep my guard up this time!

Now Jinx Valors Up!

Jinx's next attack is Jinxing Peach with a flurry of combos!

After one more attack from Mario, Jinx praises us once more, stopping the fight!

**Jinx:** "Still haven't had enough? It isn't often that I have someone this competitive to spar with! All right, this match will be the one that counts, since I'm putting my reputation on the line!"

I leave Jinx's dojo, and save outside.

If I'm not strong enough to beat Culex yet, then I feel that I'm not ready for Jinx's third (and I'm guessing, final) round!

I now make my whole way through Land's End to get back to the temple...

On the way, I figure out how to maneuver the cannons to fire where I want Mario to go to!

In one battle, I have Geno use a Geno Blast to take care of a troop of enemies, leaving a Shy Away. But the Shy Away shies away instead of fighting back...

Surprisingly, the hooded shopkeeper isn't there to give me a lift up to the cliff!

I also pick up a **Power Blast** from Stingers and an Octovader, which increases the entire party's attack power!

I keep missing the Shogun in the sand whirlpools! This time, he knows us (?) and lets us sink into the whirlpools without a battle!

But, I have to fight the Geckits in the caves...

I now arrive inside Belome's Temple.

What more surprises are in store here?

I take the chest block, which has 50 coins inside!

The shopkeeper's also there, below the Belome head statues! He asks if I want my fortune told for 50 coins...

The worst thing this shopkeeper could do is summon or turn into a monster, so I accept the offer.

He points to the three Belome heads mounted on the wall.

Afterwards, he vanishes, leaving us with the Belome heads...

Middle, left, and right is the order I have Mario hit it in, and down comes a stack of bricks with our fortune!

Here's the fortune: "**If you proceed in the pipe next door...you'll have many friends in the future.**"

I have Mario jump on the brick stack, jump up to the top, and head into the next chamber, where a green pipe awaits!

Going down the pipe, our "friends" are Chows!

I take on one in battle, where he has friends as well: two Shoguns and a Fink Flower!

The Fink Flower could also recover health too, huh? Luckily the enemy's low on physical defense.

It seems I have to take care of all of the Chows here before proceeding through the gate...

After the battle with the last Chow, Mario levels up! I boost his physical stats.

The door forward opens and a bounce pad backwards drops down!

I cross forward.

In the next room, I pick up another 150 coins from a chest block!

But after reading through a map of the temple, I jump on top of the chest, and get a hidden chest block containing a Frog Coin!

And another hidden chest block with a Frog Coin!

And the visible chest block with a Frog Coin is also ours!

We meet the shopkeeper again.

**Shopkeeper:** "If you're lucky, you'll run into Belome, and Monstro Town will be just beyond him."

Wait, Belome's still alive!?

I have Mario hit the Belome head on the wall near the shopkeeper, which puts out a scroll, reading:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/cFAGgqM.png" alt="not accepting bedtime" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

"**Sorry, I'm not accepting visitors past my bedtime.**" (I wrote the message just in case the screencap above does not show up.)

We take the yellow platform down and into...

...a room with Flowers, Frog Coins, and plenty of items!

But, a golden Belome blocks the way!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/7iWOVNE.png" alt="belome need key" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

We don't have a key, so we turn back...

I talk to the shopkeeper, who says the same thing, hit the Belome head statue, and go back to the treasure room again...

After the second try, I head back and hit the Belome bust, which now puts out a fortune that has something different to say:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/etRuiSl.png" alt="sooo hungry" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

"**Mmm, I'm so hungry! Wish I had something to eat!**"

I have Mario head back down to the yellow platform!

Instead of the treasure room, we now arrive at a room with a green pipe!

I have Mario sink into the pipe...

...where we now meet up with Belome!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/7Aamp7Z.png" alt="belome alive" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

I recover our Flower Points before facing his ravenous, four-eyed mass!

The doors behind him are lowered shut...

Looks like I have to face him!

**Belome:** "I never forget a taste! In fact, I can clone someone after just one slurp. Watch!"

He jumps in front of Mallow!

**Belome:** "You all LOOK delicious! But, how do you TASTE?"

\**gulp*\*...

He eats Mallow!

**Belome:** "YES! THIS is YUMMY~ There we are!"

He spits out Mallow, and makes a clone out of Mallow!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/zibyF0e.png" alt="belome and clone mallow" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Oh dear, how do we fight him now?

We take care of the Mallow clone in one turn!

He goes after Mario next. Mario tastes sour to him...

I have one go after Belome, while the rest of the party takes care of the clones...

After taking care of the second Mallow clone, Belome uses **Aurora Flash**, which makes Geno sleep!

So far, he hasn't eaten Geno yet...

**Belome:** "Oh no, not again! I'm STARVING! Time to go home for dinner. Goodbye, boys and girls!"

And with that, Belome is taken care of!

Now it's the lone Mario clone that's left...and that's it!

Mallow levels up, magical stats up!

With Belome finished, a green switch pad appears!

The door now opens, and our friendly Rat Funk is there, who tells us the pipe ahead leads to **Monstro Town**!

Honestly, who or what **is** Belome?

[Here's the famous, or infamous, Forest Maze theme, known as "Beware the Forest's Mushrooms".](https://youtu.be/abDCsQrDLTE) It's also this tune, from a [music video](https://youtu.be/k_q9y5vSIrw), that first made me know about this game. There's also another [music video of this song](https://youtu.be/QfXng_kD9ZA) from the same animator.

**ETA:** [Thanks to the announcement of the remake of this game, a remake of the original music video is up](https://youtu.be/A19kkspb89I).

I head forward into the forest, and I see a [**Wiggler**](https://www.mariowiki.com/Wiggler), one of the most short-fused creatures in the Mario-verse, walking around a log...

I sink down the log into a tunnel, where I see plenty of unfriendly fauna...

Bouncing back up to the surface, an arrow almost hits me!

Now I'm in an area with plenty of log pipes. Which log should I head into?

I head down into one log, and pick a fight with two **Amanitas**, and an **Octolot**.

The Octolot's a fiery one to take care of...

I pick another fight with the remaining creature in the hollow here, the **Buzzer**...

Scanning the Octolot, their mind tells us to check out their legs!

Now, which log to get into to find Geno?

In another hollow, I see a sleeping Wiggler...awww...

I sink into another log, where I encounter a huger horde of monsters!

In one of the battles, I see a Donkey Kong lookalike, the **Guerilla**...

It looks like I need to go back to town and get more Able Juice...

I accidentally get into another battle, this time with a Wiggler, and he vigors himself up on the first turn!

Scanning the Guerrilla, his mind says "don't confuse me with someone else!"

The Guerrilla has high defense, and high health too, 135 HP!

I head back to the hollow with the sleeping Wiggler, and jump on top of him!

His angry shaking bounces Mario off, and opens the passage forward!

I sink into the log in the next passage into another tunnel, where I see more Rat Funks, and a lot of bushes with Amanita in them!

Lucky Mallow's wearing an Antidote Pin, otherwise he would've been poisoned!

I make it to the end of the tunnel and bounce back up, near a save point.

This song's very catchy, and I was almost about to make up lyrics to it too...

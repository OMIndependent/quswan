As I head down, Gaz announces to his mom that he saw something amazing! He saw Geno walk into the forest! His mother doesn't believe him...

I have Mario ask around to find where Geno went, one Toad doesn't believe us either and tells us to scram...

Another Toad can't get in his house since the stairway controls are switched off.

One Toad, who gets shot by an arrow, tells us that "a strange doll dressed in a blue cape walked into the forest." Hmmmm...

These arrows are still landing near the center of town...

Lucky I haven't been hit by them so far!

I head into the item shop where I buy a few new pins, a **Thick Shirt**, and **Thick Pants** for Mario and Mallow.

I also buy more Mushrooms for the trip into the forest.

I jump up to the chimney of the item shop to fetch the chest block there, which has a Flower!

Alright, now to head out into the infamous Forest Maze!

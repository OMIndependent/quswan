Now to get back Mallow's coin!

I face Croco at the dead end, and he runs off again!

After a few runarounds and a few battles with Goombas, Spikies, and Frogogs, we finally catch him!

And now, round 2!

I use Mario's **Fire Orb** skill on Croco! I have to press the Y button (or the square button) repeatedly for extra hits!

Croco doesn't like fire, it seems...

He's even losing a turn because he's trying to put out the fire on his tail!

After another turn, he does his special attack at Mallow, but the level grinding and boosts helped reduce the damage!

After a few **Fire Orbs**, Croco's finished!

Mallow punches Croco and a green coin falls out of Croco's bag!

Croco counterattacks Mallow, says his farewells, and flees!

Mallow celebrates! We also get back the wallet Croco stole from the blue-capped Toad!

At this moment, a huge bouncing pad drops from the sky in the middle of the area!

We bounce on the pad, taking us back to the beginning of Bandit's Way, near the save block!

After a few battles with Spikies, I save my progress...

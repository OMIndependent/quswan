I head out of the subjects' chamber and into the east door in the major hallway, passing through a number of monsters to fetch the chest block there.

Along the way, I come across a new monster, **Orbison** (Roy Orbison reference?), and it performs a Recover spell.

Orbison's a strong monster defensive-wise!

But after having Mallow scan it, it has one weakness: a Jump attack!

The chest block inside has a Flower!

Now back to the major hallway, where I decide to fight the Heavy Troopa blocking the middle doorway forward!

No, it's not just one, but **three** of them!

Reading one of their minds, the Heavy Troopa promises to "make [us] beautifu!" I don't like what his interpretation of "beautiful" is...

So Heavy Troopa's attack does moderate damage, but not enough for a KO!

In the next room, a Shy Away is watering a huge pink, polka-dotted egg! With tons of nutrients!

The Shy Away notices us, and tries to leave, but the door is locked!

Now the egg, or whoever's inside the egg, is laughing! It's a bit unsettling...

What to do next? Face the egg, or turn back?

I wander around the room a bit, leave, and return. The Shy Away's still high in the air...

I have Mario talk to the egg. The someone inside the egg's "lonely" and asks us if we want to play with them...

Since the door forward's locked, it seems I've got no other choice but to "play" with the egg...

It's a boss fight!

The egg's name is **Shelly**...

I have Mario Super Jump the egg up to 11 times! The egg's showing a small crack at the top...

Peach next, and the egg's cracking...

I try scanning the egg a few times, where in one instance, the egg says, "Slow down!"

Mario and Peach finally break the egg, revealing...

...a [**Birdo**](https://www.mariowiki.com/Birdo)!

**Birdo:** "I'm Birdo."

The Birdo, according to Mallow's scan, "loves life!"

The Birdo spits out eggs at Mallow! So this is how Birdo "plays" with people.

Birdo's defense is rock solid!

Birdo "tee-hees" us, and says that we're hurting Birdo, and counters, with "hot" off the mouth eggs!

The "playtime" with Birdo continues!

I use Peach as healer while Mario and Mallow continue attacking Birdo!

I use up an item to increase the entire party's attack!

Eventually, we let Birdo on to the fact that we mean business.

[Lol...](https://youtu.be/DmgGKtYceak)

**Birdo:** "You're just too...CUTE!"

And "playtime" with Birdo is over! That was a long and tough "playtime"!

After the battle, Birdo throws the second Castle Key to us!

I decide to leave the palace, and restock, since I'm running low on recovery items...

Now how do I get to the sewers?

I leave the Mushroom Kingdom. Looks like the map's showing me my next destination...

After taking the "To Kero Sewers" route, I'm now in a new part of the map, yessss!

Mallow shows us the entrance: an ordinary green pipe...they also tell us to "watch out for 'Belome', whoever that is."

Another warning from Mallow: some parts of the sewers might be dark...

Mallow jumps in first, with Mario following.

I save my progress at the nearby block in the sewer before moving forward.

I jump in the water...so Mario *can* swim in this game...

I make it to the other side and read a nearby note that tells me how to warp in a green pipe.

I sink into the pipe, where I'm now in another area...

There's Cheep Cheeps in the water...

Two separate pipes are located at the landlocked corners of this part of the sewer.

I take the pipe in the southwest corner. As soon as I get off, I touch a rat, but he runs away as soon as the battle begins!

We get some **Pure Water** as a reward after beating the Hobgoblins, which "defeats ghosts in a wink!"

I go back to the Cheep Cheep area, and take the northeast pipe...

Boos are also here too, huh?

I use the **Pure Water** to take care of the Boo, and have Mario and Mallow take care of the Shadow...

So the rats are called Rat Funks, and they're very quick to run away!

I avoid the Rat Funks coming out of the niches as I head up to the pipe at the top.

On the way, I get a Flower in a chest, along with a **Star** in the next area, hitting a Boo...

I swim through the sewers to head into another pipe. I think I just ended up walking around in circles...

Unfortunately, a Rat Funk ambushes me, and Mallow gets poisoned by one of them!

Dangit, I should've brought some Antidotes...

***Aside:*** When I wrote this, I did not know that Antidotes don't exist in-game since the poison wore off after that battle.

The Shadow casts an **Endobubble**! I wonder what that did to Mallow, since Mallow's now shaking...

I make it to the end of the area, where I see a chest, which has...a **Mimic**, or a **Pandorite**!

The Pandorite's pretty tough...and a bit creepy...

Pandorite's attacks are usually fire-based, with a **Scream** ability.

I get 30 coins and a **Flower Jar**, with Mario leveling up! He also has a new ability, a **Power Jump**! I increase Mario's attack and defense power.

In the chest is a **Trueform Pin!**

I head back and swim away, only to come face-to-face with Cheep Cheeps, or Gobys.

Mallow levels up and learns a new ability as well! I boost Mallow's attack and defense.

Mallow's new ability works like a **Scan** or **Libra** spell in *Final Fantasy*...

After all of those battles, I head back out of the sewers to the Mushroom Kingdom to buy more supplies, and stop here for now!

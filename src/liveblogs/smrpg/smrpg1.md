***Aside:*** For any names or phrases that are unreadable, such as Znyybj, note that this is because these are [ciphered in rot13](http://rot13.com) to prevent spoilers from getting leaked to anyone who's not familiar with the game, and may want to play the game on their own someday.

There's Peach having a picnic in the fields...

...and then, she gets kidnapped by Bowser for the umpteenth time!

Now there's clips of Mario in other places...

Now a cloud character, Znyybj, is introduced here...

And now another character, Trab's introduced...

Why is Bowser in the credits?

There's Peach, or Princess Toadstool on the balcony, in...

**Super Mario RPG!**

Now I'm at the file select screen...

I decide to call my file "Mario" for this playthrough...

And Princess Peach is at her picnic, like in the intro, and gets kidnapped by Bowser. This time, Mario enters, or sprints, to Bowser's very big castle to save her!

Now the game begins!

So holding the Y button (or the square button for my controller, since I'm using a PS3 controller to play this game) makes Mario run, and pressing the B button (or the cross button) has Mario jump...

I head into the next room ahead, where my first battle awaits! Three Terrapins!

Instead of going through a drop down menu like in *Final Fantasy*, I have to press one of the four buttons (A, B, X, and Y) to decide what to do in battle...

I target the first guy with a normal attack, and Jump on the second. I take care of guy number three with another attack. They go down easy.

After a few battles, I'm now before a door where two Terrapins guard the way...or four of them!

I now cross past three bridges, lava below, and make it to the next door, where the bridge behind me collapses! No turning back now...

I'm now in a room with two chandeliers above...

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/M6ufzum.png" alt="peach tied up" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

...and there's Peach, tied up, hanging between them!

With Bowser!

Peach gives us encouraging words and the battle is on!

I attack Bowser once. In the next turn, I hit the chain on the chandelier that Bowser's standing on!

Peach tells us to aim for [~~the horn~~](https://youtu.be/XgYwdJvnf6I) the chain, Pikachu!

I do so again!

**Bowser:** "**No!!!** It's a chain reaction!!"

Goodbye...whoa, **what!?**

Bowser throws a hammer at the chain holding our chandelier...

Peach tells us to keep fighting, but Bowser breaks the chain!

Mario finishes Bowser off with a Jump! He falls...

And the usual happy ending...

But the castle's now shaking...something's happening...

A star in the clouds is shaking...and it breaks apart!

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/NECYKDp.png" alt="sword" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

There's a sword descending, surrounded by stars (I'm guessing these are the seven stars mentioned in the title), and it falls on top of Bowser's castle!

Title drop!

Mario climbs the sword out of the castle and falls...into a pipe on top of a house!

Toad sees the commotion and runs in!

Mario's now hanging on a clothes hook...

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/rPbqMrO.png" alt="toad door" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Toad tells Mario what a door is used for, and he tells Mario that he came to pick up the Princess...

We jump off the clothes hook.

I can now access the menu!

I leave and talk to Toad. He asks Mario where the Princess is. Toad's not surprised that Bowser abducted Peach again.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/lBHH4af.png" alt="save block" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

I jump on top of the floating S block, the save block, and stop here for now!

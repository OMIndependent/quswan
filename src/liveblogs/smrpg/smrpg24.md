I go off to Rose Town. It's now more brighter after we took care of the Smithy Gang member...

All the Toads thank Mario for saving the town! 

Arrows aren't falling from the sky now!

Using the Toad as a platform, I jump up to the house on the cliff...

I get the chest blocks, which have Flowers in each of them...

I head upstairs and press on the green switch to lower the staircase outside.

I head outside and the Toad thanks me for lowering the stairs! He asks me if his treasures were okay...<em>\*gulp\*</em>...oh god...were those chest blocks his "treasures"?

I lie and say "sure they were", and run quickly to the shop.

Checking the menu, I use the Flower Box I got from defeating Bowyer to increase my flower points by 5!

After restocking on items (and selling some), I head to the inn.

I speak to Gaz, and he gets his mother to have her see Geno...she thinks it's just a person in a costume...

Gaz wants Geno to play with him, but Geno tells him he has to go look for Star Pieces...

Geno then explains to Gaz everything so far, with Mario and Mallow pantomiming the scenes in the Forest Maze...

Geno asks if he gets it. **Nope.**

Everyone falls flat on their faces...lol...

Geno then says to Gaz that nobody's wishes won't come true unless he finishes his task: to collect the Star Pieces and restore Star Road.

After Gaz says that Mario needs all the help he can get...Mario goes after him! But Mallow stops him. Oh Mario...

Geno promises Gaz that he will fix Star Road.

The party joins back into Mario...but Gaz stops them! Geno and Mallow bump into Mario instead!

Gaz then goes to the corner to get something, and gives Geno the **Finger Shot!**

Geno thanks him, and the party, after side-glancing Gaz, forms back into Mario.

I go to the menu, and equip the **Finger Shot** to Geno.

Gaz's mother asks how Mario's feeling ("like a new man", I chose, with Mario jumping), and thanks him for spending time with Gaz.

I leave to head to our next destination...

The battle is on!

Now let's see what Geno's skill set has. A **Geno Beam!**

I try it out, but I feel like I haven't unleashed its full power yet...

After our turn, Bowyer decides to even the odds. He's going to do that by shooting an arrow at a certain button, so that command is locked!

I like how Geno gets items from his hat...

At least Bowyer only blocks one command at a time!

Geno punches using his fist as a rocket!

Eventually, with Mario and Geno almost near death a few times, I finally get how to use the Geno Beam, with the final blow against Bowyer for 60 damage!

I also notice the Freebies I get are just one more of the item that I used!

I win a **Flower Box** after beating Bowyer!

Geno says that he's "more than just a doll..."

Mario and Mallow look at each other and nod.

So the entity, the shooting star, is using Geno the doll as its avatar.

Mario and Mallow jump in shock.

So Geno's "higher authority" that he speaks of is in the "Star Road."

Mario and Mallow don't know about the Star Road, though...

Geno explains about how wishes are granted, which are then transformed into shooting stars. I'm guessing Gaz wished for Geno to come to life.

Geno also goes on to mention that the Star Road was crushed by a sword and no stars have been formed ever since. It's probably that Smithy Gang sword that fell on top of Bowser's castle at the beginning of the game that caused the Star Road to shatter...

Mallow notices that the Green Star is a piece of the Star Road that Geno was talking about.

So the shooting star possessing Geno came down to earth to fix the mess that the Smithy Gang created. He also says that there are seven of these Star Pieces total.

The star's true name is also hard to type...

So the shooting star chose Geno since, in the star's opinion, he was the strongest out of all of Gaz's toys...I'm betting the star may have watched Gaz and Mario play before coming down to earth. I wonder what that also says of the star's opinion of Mario and Bowser...

Now that's two Star Pieces!

But there's a stray arrow, one of Bowyer's minions, who overheard everything, and runs off to tell Smithy!

Now what's our next move?

So it's a fetch quest, more or less...and we have 5 more Star Pieces to go!

And that's it for now!

<em>**Aside:**</em> Btw, if anyone's played through this part: How long did it take for you all to get through the Forest Maze?

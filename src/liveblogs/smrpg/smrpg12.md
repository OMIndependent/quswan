The blue star hiding behind the throne now reveals itself...

We got one of the seven **Star Pieces! Yes!!!**

But what are they? I'm betting that's one of the "seven stars" that surrounded the Smithy sword before the sword fell on Bowser's castle...

The remaining Shy Guys on pogo sticks panic and run off to their boss!

We talk to the trembling Chancellor in the corner...

**Chancellor:** "Once again, Mario to the rescue!"

The Toads run into the throne room super fast, and thank Mario again!

The Chancellor's now more worried than ever, but Mallow suggests asking for their Grandpa's help, saying that he knows...everything!

Mallow introduces themselves to the Chancellor, and the Chancellor tells us that we're "[their] only hope".

Mallow forgot why they were in the Mushroom Kingdom in the first place...

So our next stop is the **Kero Sewers**...

I recover at the inn (which makes a little sound nod to *Super Mario World*), save (the file now makes note of the Star Piece we got), and head to the Shopkeeper.

We trade the **Frog Coin** for a **Cricket Pie!**

<strike>I miss the Shy Guys, though. They're a bit cute...</strike>

Inside a mine now, we see a secret above the entrance, but we can't reach it!

I use the Moo to get a Dream Stone nearby.

After some thinking, I take the Moo again, and end up going down a gap, leading to another path.

And this path takes me to the first secret!

I press on, and use the upward drafts again. Noticing an egg, I open it, and we get secret number two!

I forgot to mention, fcrnxvat sebz rkcrevrapr va cynlvat gur frdhry, that there are six secrets in total per level in a Klonoa game.

I don't take the risk going down there...

So it seems the fun part is coming: a minecart ride!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gKb6q1P.png" alt="minecart ride" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

But the minecraft keeps falling apart as I have Klonoa collect all the dream stones available...

And we make it to the end!

Outside now...

...and it's raining!

The rain comes and goes...and the happy windmill song keeps playing...

I take the top path after the bottom, and get the third secret, but end up falling...

I try again this time, and go into another tunnel... where I see our first big Moo!

Big Moos end up like that, if I remember correctly, from eating too many dream stones. And after taking care of him, I get dream stones!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/nPlyfpF.png" alt="fourth secret" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

Now back to the main path.

We end up back into more tunnel crossing, and see this little critter...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/I9qeqbq.png" alt="little spike critter" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

...who spits out spike balls!

I crush a big beam guarded by a mini-brigade of Moos, which leads to the next way forward, but I take the bottom path, giving us secret number five, and an extra life!

Up the incline, more speedy critters, and the last secret!

What's at the end of the tunnel?

**???**: "**Yes, it is Lephise for sure... Well done, Joka.**"

The deep voice speaking is literally crackling the audio of the game.

**Joka**: "I'm honored, Ghadius, your darkness."

Klonoa and Huepow find out who the voice, Ghadius, is talking about...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/qgHVgmB.png" alt="a diva" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

...and there he is! In his tall glory!

For extra creepiness, we get a zoom-in on his masked face.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/pIxVNvr.png" alt="ghadius close up" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

There's Lephise on the ground, out cold.

He asks Joka, the mini-clown with the creepy face full of sharp, red teeth, for a pendant. 

It's not on Lephise.

Uh oh...

He hears Klonoa and Huepow, calling them "mice" and has Joka clean them up.

With a sweep of his cape, revealing an entire galaxy inside, Ghadius warps away, taking Lephise with him!

Now Klonoa and Huepow take action!

After a small exchange, Joka summons his little beast...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/OuV72SV.png" alt="show time" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

Joka points out **Rongo Lango**'s weakness to us: his back! So obvious...

<p><h2 class="entry-title">Boss: Rongo Lango</h2></p>

The fight is on!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/NXc23fv.png" alt="rongo lango boss" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

I grab a Moo, but he turns around so quick!

He's quite the jumper!

Out of curiosity, I use one of the Moos to ring the bell. For a game that was made 25 years ago, that's interactive!

Sometimes the bell drops hearts!

As Rongo Lango drops a shockwave with his tail, we go after him...

...and get hit! Nuts! I was going to fight him undamaged!

We finish him off, and the second level is done, just like that!

The bell shakes a bit...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ugIJZKR.png" alt="pendant get" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

The pendant was in the mouth of the bell!

And just like that, we're at Klonoa's Grandpa's house!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/GNlmDJ9.png" alt="grandpa house" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

Grandpa explains that we have "a crest of the Moon Kingdom." <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rpxhwWPkbY">The music here sounds really nice...</a>

Grandpa calls the moon kingdom "a mystical kingdom [spoken] of in legends."

Huepow asks Klonoa about Ghadius.

Klonoa asks Grandpa, wondering if the Moon Kingdom exists. He isn't too sure, focusing on Lephise and Ghadius.

He gives us our next mission: go to Forlock Forest and tell Granny about Ghadius and Lephise.

Turn the page and save!

It's a bit disappointing that I can't backtrack, it seems this game's a one-way ride...

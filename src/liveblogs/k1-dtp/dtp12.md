Klonoa tells Pamela to stop at the base of the entrance.

And as before, he thanks her for the ride.

And also as before, Pamela tells Klonoa to be careful.

Now this is something new: a brooding Huepow. Klonoa asks what's wrong.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TAqZ2yA.png" alt="huepow brooding" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

Huepow denies anything's wrong, and says that we have to stop Ghadius first.

We enter the Moon Kingdom proper.

It's quite a place!

I'm a bit worried there might be an endless pit somewhere in this room, that's why I'm treading carefully here.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/mHefKv5.png" alt="bridge to atrium" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

I wonder what these glowing statues are here for? I'm guessing there's a certain creature we might need to catch to break them.

In the west passage, we see an electrified floor below. I wait for a drum platform to drop in.

The stakes are getting high, as I slip repeatedly, either by touching the floor, or by a Moo, and Klonoa loses a life! We did manage to rescue one friend before starting back at the start of the passage.

We do a better job this time.

We make it past the electrified platform, and end up in the background. We rescue a second friend too.

After shattering the shining red crystal, the statue in front of it turns to dust.

Now I remember why the music sounded so familiar, some parts of it are taken from the opening.

We float jump to the alcove to the east part of the atrium. Going further east, we run into a blue statue blocking the way.

Into the big passageway we go...

We're outside, Klonoa standing on a glittering perch of stars...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/dGKOJX9.png" alt="stardust balcony" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

With each step, stardust drops from the floor into the aether.

There's a green statue to take care of too.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/zksQorO.png" alt="green statue" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

We return to the atrium and enter into a room full of Ghosts. Lots of them.

It's a linear path from here to the next room.

We take the floating platform up, and take all that's here, including rescuing a third friend.

We jump onto more floating platforms, and for some reason, their edges seem to wobble, like it might topple over if we're not careful. Ghosts join in on the fun of wanting to push us down into the endless pit.

I miss a few dream stones, oh well.

We break the blue crystal, dissolving the blue statues into powder.

We go outside to the perch and enter the blue statue doorway.

There's a few yellow statues here, so we take a detour below. In the next room, a bunch of Boomies are walking about in the area below!

Another life gone from a spikey, but we breeze through the room!

Only to fall twice in the next room!

This is the Lake Shrine of this game, or almost close to it.

I manage to get our fourth friend and avoid falling the third time.

A single file of Boomies are walking around in the staircase. We take care of them, but not before Klonoa takes recoil from their explosions!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/iK7af4A.png" alt="green statue gone" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

There, green statues gone!

We're back in one of the previous rooms!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/zrRkern.png" alt="flying moos bunched up" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

We throw the Boomie and get an extra life, but I miss more dream stones. We rescue friend number five, and head back to the atrium.

We cross into the entryway where the green statue used to be.

After getting hit by the Ghosts and creatures, these hearts are a breath of air.

In the next room, we're introduced to disappearing platforms!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/XxTVRSI.png" alt="vanishing platforms" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

The dream sprite challenge was pretty easy, but quick.

Outside again, more disappearing platforms! The yellow ones are longer, and last longer, while the blue ones are smaller, and last for a short second.

We end up falling because I underestimated how long the gap was bw the yellow and the stardust platform.

We end up getting our last friend out!

Now how are we going to break that crystal?

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/lNugu5J.png" alt="yellow crystal" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

Dream sprite challenge time, and it is a tough one!

Another life gone...

We sort of manage to get it by the second try (I end up getting a dream stone too early).

Now that the yellow statue is gone, how can we get up there?

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/goZ3Og8.png" alt="how to get up there?" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

I enter back into the atrium through the blue dust entrance, and climb the steps filled with ex-yellow statues.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/FQWm1Ao.png" alt="at the top" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

More disappearing platforms later, and we're inside the center of the kingdom!

I'm guessing that the pulsing rock beneath us is what keeps the Moon Kingdom floating.

Up the steps...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/JLnYph6.png" alt="white crystal" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

We break the white crystal, activating the elevator to the upper floors!

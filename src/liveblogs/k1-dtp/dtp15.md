The fight begins!

The ring that we're in is similar to being in a hamster wheel instead of a circular arena like last time.

So if we shoot the circling warps, it leads us outside of the ring!

He shoots a beam of blue onto the ring!

We warp out of there immediately!

Inside the ring, he summons eyeless Death Moos, and after looking them up off-session, they are super nightmarish to look at, as they have no eyes and sharp teeth!

He also launches fanged, flaming orbs!

After observing his attack patterns in and out of the ring, we get a hit on him! So it's not the mask but his cape we have to hit!

We manage to succeed on take two! At half-health, Ghadius now makes triples of his mask!

He rematerializes his mask and summons bumper car-like beings (it's the only way I can describe it) with Death Moos and portals in tow! They're now flying about the ring!

After two hits, he switches up his strategy...

He conjures up a triangle barrier with Death Moos inside!

After breaking one of the bumpers, we get him with another of his Death Moos!

Unfortunately, he summons another one with a portal as a third bumper!

And the last one!

His unsettling, amplified scream echoes as his cape disintegrates and the fireworks explode on him!

Now **that** was for Grandpa!

In other news, we got everybody, and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gss1es9qLdE">Thank You Song</a> is played in full.

Next session, we wrap up **Klonoa: Door to Phantomile** once and for all!

Oh my god, this level was definitely one of the hardest! The devs gave it their all on this one! Fitting that it's also the last platforming level of this game!

I will admit, though, that if I were younger, Ghadius's voice would have been terrifying to hear, especially when the lowness of it scratches and nearly breaks the audio.

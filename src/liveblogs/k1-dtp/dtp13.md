Let's see if we can continue this...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/rWmE9u0.png" alt="elevator lands" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

The elevator takes Klonoa above the atrium, and into the upper chambers of the castle.

**???**: "Sir Huepow! Sir Huepow!"

*Sir* Huepow?

A Cressian guard appears, expecting Huepow.

The guard mentions Ghadius's takeover of the kingdom.

**???**: "We were careless..."

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FOLRRmrn4U">The music is a synth reprise of the opening tune</a>. It gives me the chills hearing it.

The queen of the kingdom appears.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/AVlMHSE.png" alt="queen" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

So Lephise is in the pulsing rock that we saw earlier, huh?

**Queen**: "[Ghadius] trapped Lephise in the egg below...And is now pouring energy from nightmares inside it."

The Queen comes closer. Huepow calls her "mother." Klonoa and I react similarly.

**Queen**: "If that egg is released, it will be disastrous for everyone."

Huepow tells her to "keep out of harm's way."

**Klonoa**: "Mother? Huepow, who are you?"

**Queen**: "Huepow..."<br/>
**Huepow**: "Klonoa...I'm really..."

In a bright light, Huepow transforms...

**Klonoa**: "Wahoo? (Wha?) But, but..."<br/>
**Huepow**: "**The Ring Spirit was my disguise.**" Why?

**Huepow**: "I had a reason to go to the outside world...I'm sorry...I can't say anything about that now. But I promise, I promise to tell you everything later!"

Klonoa is speechless.

**Huepow**: "I want you to just trust me. Just a little bit more, can you help us just a little bit more? ...Klonoa!"

Klonoa smirks.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/hgXlQx7.png" alt="klonoa smile" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

**Klonoa**: "What are you talking about? We've been friends forever, right?!"<br/>
**Huepow**: "Klonoa...**Thank you.**"

The Queen praises Huepow for finding a "fine friend" like Klonoa.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/eOq7ZJb.png" alt="wahoo let's go" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

:frowning2:

Since this is the almost the end, the moment Klonoa said "let's go," I have a feeling that something not good is going to happen to these two once Ghadius is over and done with.

Huepow transforms back so quickly!

The Queen and her guard leave to the lift for the atrium below.

We check the crystal beacon in the center of the area.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/n0on483.png" alt="crystal beacon" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

As we circle around the beacon, I notice the supporting pillars are hourglasses.

We take a platform and go back inside the tower, and enter another doorway.

Now this is quite terrifying.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/le4v4I4.png" alt="tiny platforms?" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

As soon as we land on the first platform, the Moos materialize!

We rescue the first friend here and enter a room. The stained glass window looks beautiful...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/bexHBbu.png" alt="inside first tower" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

One offline interruption later, I take up the near-olympian task of getting to the balcony in the other side of the room.

We lose a life, and have to go back before the tiny platforms!

We make it in our second wind.

The devs know that that part inside the tower was tricky, so they gave us a checkpoint.

Now to get that friend out of the bubble!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/CW1rqI2.png" alt="second friend rescue" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />
 
We do so, pass the spikey, and go down the ramp, where we meet (be gung jr jvyy zrrg ntnva) the Slazza (or Hornamoos), infamous for those boomerang antennae.

A Big-shielded Moo stops us from going further, and we do the whole rescue again.

We make it to a dead end with a switch, and use a flying Moo to activate it!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/djN6Srt.png" alt="switch" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

Down another spiraling ramp, and we're back in the tower!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9O21a5d.png" alt="first tower puzzle" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

So all these three switches need to be lit up before one of them turns off again.

By activating all three, the pillar to the next room is raised, and our exit open!

Klonoa's now sliding on a sand stream!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/jjwDdHz.png" alt="sand stream" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

We take a platform back to the crystal beacon!

Entering the half-moon green door now...

...and we fall!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/B8ZknpI.png" alt="green door challenge" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

Oh my god! :joy:

Knowing that this challenge is going to be a time and life consumer, I ignore the rest of the dream stones, and rescue our friend here!

The next room is no slouch either.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/S4ILueF.png" alt="inside second tower" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

At the top is a platform and a duo of spikeys, one moving horizontally, and the other vertically, guarding the perch to the next area.

The disappearing platforms make a return here.

We end up breaking a few eggs, and getting prizes!

I end up rescuing a fourth friend, and losing a life to a big golden armored Moo!

To take care of him, I have to catch flying Moos from the windows in the tower.

Next stop, moving platforms, and vanishing ones!

We grab another Moo from a window, and activate the second switch to get us back into another puzzle room.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0ORsxZt.png" alt="second tower puzzle" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

With two Moos and a floating jump of faith, we open the next passage onwards!

One more room to activate...

The blue new moon room now.

And what a difficult section this one is!

A dream sprite challenge and a friend to rescue, with armored Moos chasing us, while standing on platforms no huger than Klonoa! The platforms are pretty sturdy, as it supported a big armored Moo without buckling!

After messing up thrice, we make it! Oh my gosh, what a heartstopper that part was!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/SwsbDtX.png" alt="inside third tower" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

You have got to be kidding me!

Our old foes from Vision 4-1, the spinning spiky monsters, return!

I wait patiently, timing is important here.

We make it back out!

After jumping up to avoid the big spinning spikey, I grab a trampoline shield Moo, and take care of that guy!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ztDGvU5.png" alt="outside third tower" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

Before hitting the switch that the spikey guarded, I noticed something nearby: our last friend to rescue!

Now we go downramp, and face off against another puzzle, but outside this time!

We take the golden heart, but we end up losing a life!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/RXrZktJ.png" alt="slazza tower" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

With care and struggle (tons of it), we use the lancer Moo and the Slazzas above to get us up and out!

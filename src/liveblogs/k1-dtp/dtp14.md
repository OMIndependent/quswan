Inside the top of the third tower now, near-exhausted from the Slazza and lancer Moo moving platform section.

After some thinking, I execute my strategy, and with Klonoa taking a hit, we open the door to the last area!

Ghadius, here we come!

Klonoa is floated up above the stars!

**Ghadius**: "But what is this dream? A dream that cannot be corrupted by nightmares."

Klonoa materializes slowly from a pillar of light.

The room spins until it focuses on Ghadius, who turns to us. He calls the whole affair "amusing," not realizing that we followed him around till the very end.

***Aside***: One touch I forgot to mention were the blue torches lighting up as the camera panned to Ghadius.

He tells us we're late.

Klonoa asks Ghadius why do this. I think he already told us why back in the Temple of the Sun.

Ghadius explains further.

Huepow warns Ghadius he'll also be gone too once he summons Nahatomb.

**Ghadius**: "It doesn't matter. **I have already been abandoned by the world. This time, it's my turn to throw the world away.**" :frowning2:<br/>
**Klonoa**: "No!"<br/>
**Huepow**: "Never!!"

Ghadius opens his cape, revealing a swirling dimension instead of stars, and laughs!

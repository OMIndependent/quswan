[*Klonoa: Door to Phantomile*][k1-link] (or 風のクロノア door to phantomile/*Kaze no Klonoa: door to phantomile*/*Klonoa of the Wind: Door to Phantomile*) is a 2.5D action puzzle platformer for the PlayStation released on December 11, 1997 in Japan, and developed by Namco (before their merger to Bandai in 2005). The game was released in North America on March 10, 1998, and in Europe on June 5, 1998.

This game would go on to win Best Character Award in the 1997 Japan Game Awards, and the franchise would be revisited in a prequel released for the WonderSwan called [*Klonoa: Moonlight Museum*][mm-link], released only in Japan on May 20, 1999, and a canonical sequel released on the PS2, which I will also be covering.

A remake was released for the Wii on December 4, 2008 in Japan, May 5, 2009 in North America, and May 22 in Europe. A remastered compilation of the two main games was released for the Nintendo Switch on July 8, 2022, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the *Klonoa* franchise.

This playthrough will cover the original PS1 version.

I played through this game originally on **July 18, 2022**, but had to restart (due to loss of notes) on **July 31, 2022** to **August 18, 2022**.

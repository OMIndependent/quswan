**Note**: I wrote this the next day after I finished my session, hence why the written date is out of order. I had a feeling I missed a scene before facing the final boss during my playthrough, and I was right, so I'm adding it here now.

Everyone's arrived at the throne: Balue, King Seadoph, Karal, Pamela, Granny, and Moire!

The Moon Kingdom's Queen is also here!

**Huepow**: "I suppose we can finally celebrate."<br/>
**Ghadius**: "**I don't know about that...**"

Everyone turns to him! He's still alive.

**Ghadius**: "The nightmare energy is already full."

Ghadius's cape disintegrates and his mask, no, head, floats in the air!

**Ghadius**: "It has taken over Diva Lephise's body...And Nahatomb shall be born any time now."

A smile spreads over Ghadius's face!

**Ghadius**: "The world's dreams passed through a prism...A source of all that is Phantomile. As long as those dreams exist, no one can stop Nahatomb."

**Ghadius**: "This strange dream...Nahatomb will destroy it...**Hear this, strange dream! The world is finished! And this is the beginning of the perfect nightmare!**"

He laughs as he blows himself up, and the crystal at the beacon below shines a dark light!

The pulsing rock, or egg, breaks, and Nahatomb is set free!

King Seadoph said it: Ghadius was the final push to break the egg using his own nightmare energy!

The Queen, though, has a secret weapon for situations like this.

**Queen**: "It is time to combine the strengths of the 5 tribes. Please, please help me."

Everyone pitches in!

Pamela rides everyone else to the sky.

As Klonoa follows them, Huepow has something to say.

**Huepow**: "Klonoa...Nahatomb is...**Nahatomb is really after you. That 'strange dream' Ghadius spoke about is you, Klonoa!**"

Klonoa...does not know how to take that.

The ceiling's crumbling!

They take Karal and ride to the skies!

Fair warning, years before I started this playthrough, I spoiled myself for this part. I just hope I don't remember it...

Back at Breezegale now...

Klonoa and Huepow are sitting on top of the cliffside.

Klonoa tells Huepow to relax.

**Klonoa**: "Besides, there's no more Nahatomb to worry about." :frowning2:

Klonoa asks if Huepow's going back to the Moon Kingdom.

Klonoa lays down, wanting to play like old times.

Huepow lays it down for his "friend."

**Huepow**: "**You don't really exist in this world!**"

Oh my god!

Thank goodness I don't remember this part now.

**Huepow**: "I called you from your world...So we could restore the balance of dreams."

Klonoa doesn't believe it.

**Huepow**: "**This world is not your reality!**"

**Klonoa**: "The first time I met you. Playing together with you!" So did I, unless...

Huepow made them up!

Huepow gets up.

**Huepow**: "It's the truth. **The strange dream Ghadius spoke of...your presence in our world is like a strange dream...**"<br/>
**Klonoa**: "No..." :frowning2: <br/>
**Huepow**: "When Lephise sings her song to renew the world...You won't be able to stay in this world."

I'm in shock.

Huepow wants to say something...

There's Lephise at the Moon Kingdom's throne...

And she sings her Song of Rebirth.

A vortex opens up behind Klonoa...

**Huepow**: "Klonoa...**it's time for you to go home, back to your Phantomile.**"

But as Klonoa gets pulled in, Huepow has a change of heart and tries to pull him back, grabbing onto the ring!

Goodbye Klonoa...

Huepow cries...

As the Song reaches its climax, the flora bloom.

Huepow wipes his tears away, and smiles.

The credits roll, as the pages turn back.

All of the memories are shown, starting with Huepow, fighting Ghadius, the rise of the Moon Kingdom, all the way back to where Klonoa met Huepow in the forest...

The ring next to the book shines...

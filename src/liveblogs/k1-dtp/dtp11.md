I almost read Coronia as Corona.

I accidentally spoiled myself in that there are 72 friends that need rescuing. I've rescued 54 friends already, so counting this level, there's three more levels to go.

Now we're in the thick of it...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/1A613iT.png" alt="vision start" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

The first sight Klonoa sees is a wounded priest!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/22rkw5r.png" alt="wounded priest" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

The priest says he "was ambushed." Oh no...

Klonoa asks him who he is.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/lf9VyJ3.png" alt="moire" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

The priest introduces himself as Moire the High Priest.

Unfortunately, we're too late. Ghadius has opened the gateway...

**Moire**: "The kingdom of legend will return soon."<br/>
**Klonoa**: "That can't be!"<br/>
**Moire**: "**The Moon Kingdom Cress gathers up dream power...and gives shape to Phantomile.**"

**Moire**: "That is, everything you see around you...Ghadius wants to replace that dream with nightmares...and set loose evil unto the world."

Klonoa shuts his eyes, saddened.

Huepow's not backing down, though.

**Huepow**: "Even if the Moon Kingdom appears, we can still stop Ghadius!"

Klonoa is emboldened by his words. Moire's not so sure.

The priest then gives us his blessing and warns us that "the eclipse gives power to evil ones," and while light exists, we should use that to our advantage.

What does he mean by that?

Klonoa repeats Moire's words.

When we head outside, the darkness comes, and platforms appear. So do the nightmare creatures...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/wE7wXOv.png" alt="darkness comes" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

As long as the darkness is there, the creatures are invincible. But it's temporary, as light returns to the temple later.

Getting to the other side of this ledge is tricky...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/fvpBsdx.png" alt="ledge w fire spout" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

By using the switches, we can toggle the in-out pillars here.

So many multiple paths. I go west, there's trampolines. East, tunnels.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/itACrNz.png" alt="many tunnels" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

We walk to the tunnel outside, observe, and go back.

The trampolines get us back to the higher alcove.

We collect the heart and drop down onto the in-out platform.

Knowing there's a second friend to be rescued, we go to the middle tunnel.

Back in and out using the east path, we lose a life thanks to an invincible nightmare Moo.

I have to remember, as long as there is daylight, the creatures are not immune.

We make it the top of the stairs!

We leap onto the platforms when the darkness appears.

Seeing a friend in a bubble, we use a flying Moo to cross the wide gap with a fire spout filling the gap.

Inside another light beam elevator...

I nearly succeeded in a dream sprite challenge, though I'm relieved I got an extra life. Unfortunately, we end up losing it because of the invincible nightmare creatures and the fire-breathing exhausts...

...and Klonoa's almost out of health again!

Instead of using the platform to go inwards where the armored Moos are, we head east and get our health restored!

We see another bubble where a fourth friend is. I wait for the light to fade...

...and then rescue him!

Back inside the temple again...another life gone!

We go west and use a Glibz to activate a switch that pushes the pillars in.

Outside, we rescue a fifth friend, and back in again!

We crisscross through the mini-maze, using the creatures nearby, and rescue the last friend in this level!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TSXZ02j.png" alt="rescue last friend" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

We cross the metal platform in the middle of the mini-maze to make our getaway!

The devs are aware that this is a tough level, being generous with the golden hearts.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/SJ1JSWB.png" alt="dark creature" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

As soon as the light shows up, we take one of the swoopers and throw it to the switch!

I push the pillar back once we reach the other side...

It's close, but we make it to the next elevator room!

Looks like there's more adventure left...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/6v4qXgv.png" alt="more tunnels" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

If that's the way to Ghadius and Joka, then we need to find a way to get up there.

We're near the top of the temple, and we have to open these switches to free a Moo.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/VqFA9wR.png" alt="caged moo" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

There's around four or five of them to activate. We already got two in so far.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/X7KDwuu.png" alt="switches around" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

We did it! It turns out I have to use the Moo as a boost jump inside the elevator room.

Klonoa lands on a platform that leads us to the entrance to the boss room...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/te1RJIk.png" alt="entrance to elevator four" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

Or the elevator up to Ghadius and Joka.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Cpnp6CJ.png" alt="lift on the way" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

We reach the top of the temple!

Oh no, Ghadius!

Ghadius turns to Joka...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/vHncJlN.png" alt="explain" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

Joka tries to explain himself, but from experience, I know what kind of a villain Ghadius is.

Or not, as Ghadius ignores Joka.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/qHo9lWf.png" alt="what are you planning?" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

Ghadius desires "simple revenge" for being trapped for 3 millennia.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/m4KrTGT.png" alt="ghadius monologue" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

**Ghadius**: "Well, I'll plunge all of you and your world into a sea of nightmares!"

He opens his cape...revealing Lephise!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/uL1uEij.png" alt="open cape" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

Ghadius announces his plan to hatch his "egg of destruction" onto the world, and vanishes!

Klonoa and Huepow decide to chase after him!

Joka stops them, his voice now distorted...

That clown mask is still angry at us for beating him not once, not twice, not thrice, but four times!

He grows into a giant and the floor panels rise to the sky!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/JWA6UhJ.png" alt="joka boss" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

<a name="boss"></a>

<p><h2 class="entry-title">Boss: Joka</h2></p>

He bows...

And the fight is on!

What is he planning to do?

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/PtKSbGT.png" alt="joka walks" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

He casually walks, while his fists rotate around him like rotating shields!

One hit barely made a mark on his health.

Three hits and the darkness returns...

He summons wisps to him...and transforms!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/LfT1wDz.png" alt="transformation" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

The Moos have turned into nightmares, unable to be caught, while Joka starts swinging his scythe-like arms!

I figure out that we need to turn the floors yellow by walking over them, turning dark into light, metaphorically.

As soon as we do that, the light comes back, and Joka turns back into his usual self!

Joka's walking a bit faster this time, and more randomly.

Knowing the pattern of when he's going to transform, we hit him thrice.

Purple panels make this harder now, so does a sweeping attack circling the whole arena!

Back to light, Joka's jumping this time.

The darkness comes once more.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/2qBWqIr.png" alt="sweeping attack" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

Miraculously, we change him back again!

No hits were made, his defense is rock solid.

Here we go again...

Two lives spent later, on the eighth hit, we finally take care of Joka!

That was for Grandpa!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/PXPHjd3.png" alt="vision clear" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

The arena descends down to earth.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/MprJvqK.png" alt="joka done" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

**Joka**: "Shamed. Defeated. Dishonored. **But...the time has come. Listen well. The sound of the Moon Kingdom's return. You'll end up in darkness, in a nightmare...In a world of nothingness...Agh, my Ghadius!**"

Joka blows up!

I'm treated to a cutscene.

The crystal in the middle, the barrier sealing the Moon Kingdom, is shattered.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TwbT6qT.png" alt="crystal shines" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

A beam of light drops down.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ndqE2pZ.png" alt="beam of light" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

The light splits into three, one per Kingdom: Jugpot, Forlock, and Breezegale. 

They end up hitting the center of their large wheels, and rebound to the center of the kingdoms.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Atvjudu.png" alt="center" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

A brief silence.

The Moon Kingdom rises from the ground!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/52YZu6o.png" alt="moon kingdom rises" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

It's quite a beautiful palace.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/z7wb8uw.png" alt="moon kingdom rises 2" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

**Huepow**: "Nightmare energy is being spread around the world."

Klonoa bares his fangs in fury. It's Klonorbin' time!

Pamela swoops in, and tells Klonoa to jump on! Yes, we're going up there!!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/fBUOkBI.png" alt="up to the moon kingdom" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

Even the storybook reveals the Moon Kingdom too.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/EuDqCiI.png" alt="end screen" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

The fireworks are more numerous now!

Next session, we enter the Moon Kingdom.

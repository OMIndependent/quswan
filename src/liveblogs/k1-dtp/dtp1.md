Originally I had the first level done and written down on the 18th, but since I accidentally deleted my old notes for this playthrough while I was syncing notes from my phone, I'm going to have to start over again!

Lucky I didn't get very far...

Now that I have recovered from the shock of deletion, and am in a playing mood, it's time to start Klonoa!

My reactions won't be as fresh as last time, so bear with me.

I watch the opening cutscene movie.

Awww, look at Klonoa...

There's a firebird flying in the sky.

A priestess of sorts...

Uh oh, look at those teeth...

Klonoa pulls out the ring...

...and there's a blue, glowing sprite...

Here's the title screen.

The menu theme sounds jolly, but it sounds like there's a tinge of sadness to it, or that's just me.

I name the file Klonoa since this is his game.

Here we go!

The ROM I have is a bit glitchy in the opening.

"**It's strange...<br/>
Sometimes I can't remember my dreams, though I'm sure I just saw them.<br/>
Where do those dreams go?<br/>
But I remember this dream, as clearly as if it were reflected in a mirror...**"

There's a butterfly!

Awww...Klonoa's face...

Then something crash-lands in the sky!

It's the ring!

Klonoa pulls it out!

It's a blue sprite!

Awww...

Now the darkness comes in...

The Bell rings ominously...so the theme of Bells is prevalent in this game too...

The darkness closes in on Klonoa and his sprite friend!

So it was just a dream, after all...

There's the ring and Klonoa's sprite friend!

This is the first time I've seen these drum platforms in a long time...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/b3nV4If.png" alt="moo drum" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

Now how do we get to the higher ledges?

A water spout nearby pushes us up!

We get to higher ground, and Klonoa sees the most unusual sight: a waterfall flowing upward!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/rC3ky83.png" alt="waterfall flowing up" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

We get a long shot of the waterfall.

Now what could be the cause of this?

Huepow suggests going to the castle for answers.

I find our first friend, and another scenic shot!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/UPxb4l4.png" alt="first friend location" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

After taking some damage, we rescue our second friend at the bottom edge of the waterfall.

Either the rocks or controls are getting slippery, or it's just me.

Inside the waterfall, we're greeted by more spike spewers, and they're not cute.

I take a manta ray creature on the east side of the area, and use him to get an extra life and a third friend saved!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/OLYRG0b.png" alt="fourth friend bubble" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

Now this is going to be tricky...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/3uwPxHg.png" alt="outside again" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

After rescuing friend number four, we slip and fall down the waterfall...

The Moo on the rock above the tunnel below leaves after we leap from the side rock.

Another long gap to reach...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/KYfoUEl.png" alt="gap dream sprite" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

Ooh boy...

I miss the flying Moo, and end up going down. Ah well, that was a tricky jump anyway.

We make it past more thin columns, but I end up sending Klonoa to the water. :frowning:

It takes me a couple of tries, but I end up acing the dream sprite challenge, and passing the moving drum platforms here...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/XIO7P8P.png" alt="entrance to castle" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

We're now in the castle's entrance.

Now there's only one way to go but down.

Or two ways, since there's another friend to save, but the bubble is way on the other side.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZK7OmhV.png" alt="fifth bubble far" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

Timing is everything!

Heading east, we let the spout push us up to the ledge.

We end up sliding down a fun, fast stream, an improv water slide, filled with indestructible spikeys.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/H3fxpiM.png" alt="exited water slide" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

I suddenly realize why the big yellow Moo's here, and with his help, get the last friend of the level, and full health!

Down another water slide!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gCz6Do7.png" alt="another water slide" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

I can't fight the current to get the remaining stones here!

Now more spikeys are blocking the rocky pillars! As I pass through, they rotate, possibly to push us off!

But we pass them easily, and make it back out!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/kUSJNcM.png" alt="save me" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

We free the fish!

Klonoa asks what happened.

**Fish**: "Well, weirdos came here and messed up the castle."

Huepow jumps to the same conclusion as I do: Ghadius!

The fish offers a ride to take us to the castle. She wants us to save her mother too.

Huepow thinks the fish's mother is "under some evil spell." Ghadius.

Klonoa jumps on!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/U8wxyMs.png" alt="i'm karal" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

Klonoa and Huepow make their acquaintances to Karal, and we enter the seashell castle.

<p><h2 class="entry-title">Boss: Pamela and Seadoph</h2></p>

I'm expecting another boss fight...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Lf6AVg3.png" alt="leap out" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

**Klonoa**: "So this is the castle..."

And I'm right!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/reR45At.png" alt="seadoph" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

The "king" introduces himself as Seadoph. And he knows us because he's working for Ghadius!

He summons Pamela, Karal's mother.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/GT79HES.png" alt="pamela red eyes" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

Oh no...Huepow's right. She is under Ghadius's, or Seadoph's, spell.

Seadoph gets on Pamela, and it's on!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/vSfEv7B.png" alt="boss start" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

The rolling iron spiked balls aren't helping either.

While we leap off a spike ball, Pamela lunges! Owch!

I realize what to do: I use Seadoph, wait until Pamela lunges, and throw him back at her!

Half health, Pamela's shooting bubbles into the air and letting them drop on us!

Four hits, easy win!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ea5lz7G.png" alt="vision clear" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

That was close, though...

Pamela rises from the water...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/PTe3TA5.png" alt="pamela saved" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

Her eyes are blue now. We saved her!

Joka comes back and he's not happy we beat the King of Jugpot.

Joka jumps furiously, calling Seadoph every name in the book.

Klonoa shuts Joka up, using the wind bullet to push him into the water.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/FiJl7ts.png" alt="seadoph back" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

So King Seadoph was brainwashed too...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/pPbilHt.png" alt="ghadius plotting" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

He points out Granny's also in danger.

**Seadoph**: "Granny knows a lot about ancient legends...she should know something about the Moon Kingdom."<br/>
**Klonoa**: "And that's why Jugpot's water was made to flow backwards..."<br/>
**Huepow**: "To kill off Forlock Forest!"

Klonoa decides they have to go back to Forlock before Ghadius does. 

Seadoph reverses the water flow so we can make the trees healthy and cross the Ferry there.

He calls on Karal to take us back to Forlock!

That's an epic shot right there!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ro5vpuj.png" alt="wahoo" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

And we're back!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gNTul58.png" alt="ty karal" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

We now take a leaf up to the higher parts of the forest...

Hoo, that was a tense level. Sort of short, but still tense.

I use up another save slot just in case I want to go back to Jugpot again.

This is going to be the last time I play this game for now. I listen the menu select waltz for the last time as I type this.

Here we go!

A beam fires high up to the Aurora lights.

Klonoa's riding on Karal to the final arena!

I wonder if I missed a few cutscenes or if this is just after we took care of Ghadius?

<strong>Note</strong>: [I did miss a cutscene](../dtp16), and it was important. I shouldn't have stopped my session immediately after beating Ghadius! :man_facepalming:

Everyone else is there with Klonoa too.

The Queen, with Balue, and all of our friends, are there to assist us with Moon Cannons.

<strong>Queen</strong>: "There is no time. Listen carefully. These cannons have no effect unless 5 shots are fired at the same time. We will aim the cannons. You can pass us [ammo]."

Klonoa asks what kind of ammo. Balue suggests caught monsters.

Klonoa tells Karal to hide as Nahatomb emerges!

That is one big Oogie Boogie nightmare right there!

The fight begins!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ntJmJJq.png" alt="vision start" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

Nahatomb summons armored Death Moos from its back!

It performs a fist slam over the arena, breaking the Death Moos' armor!

It sticks out its long tongue to try to get at us!

We get one creature in a cannon.

Eventually our friends fire their cannons, and Nahatomb's health goes down!

Or not, as it counters with a sweeping wave, blowing everyone away! He swallows Klonoa whole!

The real final battle is here!

A fa√ßade-like, four-eyed Nahatomb faces us now!

V orggre trg hfrq gb erzrzorevat gung gurer ner gjb cunfrf bs n obff sebz urer ba bhg, rfcrpvnyyl va gur frdhry.

The arena tilts like a seesaw as Nahatomb fires swirling tornado beams from its eyes!

We have to shoot the crystals at the edges of the arena.

One life gone, one more left...riding on the edge here.

And we manage to get them all!

But Nahatomb has some health left! The nightmare summons a big gem that moves around the background.

Nahatomb's done! Or is it?

The arena shatters as Klonoa falls...

Now for Nahatomb's third form, and everyone's back!

Everyone's hiding, and we have to capture more monsters as ammo for their cannons, but we double jump this time!

Nahatomb breaks two of the platforms and performs a sweeping wave!

Unfortunately, I'm now on my last life!

I fail, and retry the level once again with two lives!

This time, I get a taste of what happens if Klonoa makes contact with Nahatomb's tongue!

Lots of retries later, we're back at his third phase.

I end up getting my first game over!

Concentration needed!

We did it!

Fade to white...

Now, Huepow decides to make his final shot at Nahatomb! He asks Klonoa to shoot him at the nightmare! 

Klonoa's not taking this too well.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/p05R7mq.png" alt="we'll be together" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

<strong>Huepow</strong>: "We have to win...with both of our strengths combined!"

Klonoa agrees, and fires Huepow at it!

<strong>Klonoa</strong>: "<strong>Take that!!!</strong>"

Down goes the nightmare!

Silence.

There's Lephise!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/egpAeDe.png" alt="lephise awaken" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

<strong>Klonoa</strong>: "The Diva... Lephise..."

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/wpsIYaV.png" alt="lephise again" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/iQ421HQ.png" alt="thank you" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

She smiles.

<strong>Lephise</strong>: "All the nightmares have disappeared."

King Seadoph jumps for joy! Balue's crying at the sight of her...

Klonoa smiles, all is well. But... where's Huepow?

:frowning2:

A blue light glows behind Klonoa...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/sCwCxnW.png" alt="we'll be together" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

He transforms into his true self!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/KqiJMXD.png" alt="klonoa huepow" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

<strong>Huepow</strong>: "It's all right... I'm just a little tired..."

Klonoa notices he's hurt.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/hEI2AlT.png" alt="don't worry" id="liveblog" width="480" height="360" />

Awww...

<strong>Klonoa</strong>: "I won't let you go..."

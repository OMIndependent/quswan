Oh boy, this is going to be a tough ending to get through, especially in this replay. But I have to do it.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/haNKx42.jpg" alt="kingdom to be rebuilt" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

There's the Kingdom of Sorrow.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Ox1fsmv.jpg" alt="looking on" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

The gang is looking on.

Leorina's going there now, to rebuild the kingdom...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/LoUNVVC.jpg" alt="leorina ship" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

**Lolo**: "Leorina's really excited to rebuild the Kingdom of Sorrow, isn't she?"

Klonoa nods.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/qpxqZP2.jpg" alt="i'm going to work hard" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

Yup, she probably told the High Priestess everything offscreen.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ASwa7Wk.jpg" alt="lolo without leaf" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

**Klonoa**: "You... gave up... your title?"

Yup.

**Lolo**: "But don't worry! I'm not giving up! I'm going to keep trying, even if I fail."

She doesn't want the King to cry again.

Here we go. Even when I started this game years ago, I knew back then Klonoa wasn't going to be there to stay...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/2Tjpg0v.jpg" alt="popka reaction" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

Popka turns and goes back to sleep.

**Lolo**: "So... this is goodbye?"

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/WJcTWfD.jpg" alt="of course" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

**Lolo**: "You have to go home, right? You have a home to go to after all, right?"

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/6IgfJzZ.jpg" alt="klonoa sad" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

She knew this moment was coming too. She smiles, saying that she'll be alright...

But she can't hold back anymore...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/EYfd7oL.jpg" alt="the moment" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

**Lolo**: "**No! No no no no...**"

Now he says something his old friend said to him.

**Klonoa**: "Lolo..."

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Jx2seNV.jpg" alt="we'll always be together" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

**Klonoa**: "...**We'll always be...together.** I believe that if you don't forget the sadness of this moment, **we'll always be...together.** Okay?"

Lolo cries more. :pensive:

**Klonoa**: "So... Lolo."

They let go.

**Klonoa**: "Thanks."

He goes.

Klonoa looks at Popka sleeping as he leaves...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9JIMqxj.jpg" alt="klonoa leaving 2" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

Goodbye, Klonoa.

Credits roll...

There's Leorina, Tat, and a lot of people rebuilding the Kingdom of Sorrow...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ejEjer3.jpg" alt="credits 1" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

Lunateans are out and about in the Sea of Tears. Some are resting in La-Lakoosha.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Zx7iydL.jpg" alt="credits 2" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

There's Momett the Showman in front of the Goddess Claire statue.

Volkans and Mira-Mirans are enjoying what Joilant has to offer. In Volk, the citizens are seeing the factory make hoverboards.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/qxM7UXJ.jpg" alt="credits 3" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

I sort of laugh a bit at that part.

More citizens all over the world rebuild Volk...

The ark's in full operation now. Everyone in Lunatea's traveling everywhere.

The Mira-Mirans are looking through a giant telescope, Joilanters are looking around the Christmas village.

The Old Tree has a lot of mice around his trunk.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/EUv31Pc.jpg" alt="credits 4" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

There's the reborn and finally happy King of Sorrow, with the High Priestess holding him.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/r2gIV8e.jpg" alt="credits 5" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

Bye, Lolo and Popka.

The dream voice is calling for help again. This time, Lolo and Popka hear it too.

Even after playing this game many times, that voice never fails to give me the chills.

**Lolo**: "Who can that be?"<br/>
**Klonoa**: "I don't know. But I've been hearing that voice for the longest time. And it's asking for help."<br/>
**Lolo**: "For help?"

Klonoa nods.

The music in this level, is (and I rarely say this word) complex to analyze because of the many instruments and voices playing in this piece.

The paths in this place are so narrow.

If I counted correctly, this is the fourth time Klonoa heard that voice.

There's doll piece number one!

We end up missing the rampoline, and fall after getting the flying dream stones!

It has definitely been a long time since I remembered this level.

We continue cruising through the huge gaps and valleys, avoiding burners along the way. Soon, we pick up a stray flying Moo and jump to get the second doll piece!

The cannon launches us into a hole...

...into another spiraling wheel of an area.

Third doll get!

Now the trip's getting a bit dizzying...

After getting doll number four, we overshoot the turn and end up falling at the curve's edge...

We make it out, and bounce down...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/xHLKoHT.jpg" alt="up in the air" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

...To more narrow rampway!

This forgotten path is definitely a bit tricky to cross.

We pass a spikey and get doll piece number five!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/vYCXwyR.jpg" alt="fifth piece get" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

We pass through a set of five burners and cross to the small rampoline on the left side, but end up not getting enough height to make it to the ledge!

Take two, we make it and follow the succession of bouncing ramps to a cannon...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/uwJrYPA.jpg" alt="up in the air 2" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

I ignore the flying dream stones, pass the burners and spinning spikey, and grab the last doll piece at the end of this detour.

Back at the group of burners, and the path ahead gets narrower again.

We shortly go into a cannon, which shoots us to the exit!

[Here's the music for the Forgotten Path (Mirage)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b71mUed3WHo).

Outside, the path to the final level is open!

Since we've collected all sixteen Momett Dolls (96 pieces total), a prompt congratulates us!

I kind of wonder, though, how did Klonoa get to the Forgotten Path?

Next session, the finale!

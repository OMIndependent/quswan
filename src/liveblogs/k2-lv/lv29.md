Let's stop that ark!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/07rDjId.jpg" alt="stop all three engines" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

**Klonoa**: "Let's go then!"

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/YJCF6q7.jpg" alt="vision start" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

We start near the second turbine.

Inside, a Kiton awaits!

After taking damage from touching the Kiton, we cross past the molten drink, getting the dream stones.

We take another hit from the Kiton across the drink, and collect the remainder.

How do we get that doll piece?

Ignoring it for now, we cross over to the pipe, and carry a mini-Boomie to the higher ledge, where the second piece is!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/G2Shrp0.jpg" alt="doll piece get" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

We end up losing a life after one too many explosions, lucky we picked up an extra from the egg we broke behind the platform wheel earlier.

I decide not to get any creatures and get the first piece.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/c7TFtnC.jpg" alt="first doll piece get" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

Klonoa's getting hurt a lot in this level!

We drop down to the lower floors, but since we need a key, we use a Jetimo to get back up, and to the other side.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/SrjdSqM.jpg" alt="armor moo" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

We end up going up and down many times, until another life gone thanks to the big, armored Moo!

I take the risk and pass the big Moo to grab the key to the first engine room!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/S8gFxZd.jpg" alt="in engine room 1" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

We take the moving platform back to the engine.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/7FTJVi3.jpg" alt="at engine" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

**Popka**: "Awright, this is it!"<br/>
**Klonoa**: "Uh, how do we stop it?"

Popka points to the Boomie on the lower deck of the engine.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/FcLinZE.jpg" alt="boomie" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

The middle deck is surrounded by a group of flying Moos!

We fail the first time, because of low health, and one touch from a flyer!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/pgCX0Q3.jpg" alt="explosion" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

**Klonoa**: "Okay, two more to go! Hey! Wait a... sec..."

The engine exhaust explodes!

**Klonoa**: "**Run for it!!!**"

A countdown begins...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/O2EVF1R.jpg" alt="countdown timer" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

...we hightail it outside!

The chamber explodes!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/sR6h9hg.jpg" alt="explosion" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

Klonoa's "manya" scream echoes out!

And we get saved by the Sky Pirates!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/PWEUo0T.jpg" alt="hey tat" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

Tat gives out her "it's not 'cause I like you or anything" blurb, because of our history with Leorina.

**Popka**: "Ahh-hmmm... ya ain't so bad, after all." You tease.

We fall down to the area near the third engine. I push the elevator down this time.

A trio of Boomies spawn!

We use one to get up, and another one to break an egg.

Now we use the trampoline to jump up and head back into the room with the swinging platforms and rollers.

Jumping up to the ledge isn't going to be so casual...

We make it up there, and collect the stones. Going to the other end of this room, though, not so much. The height and distance is a bit of a reach.

We make that obstacle too, and take a cannon down to the lower floor.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/npJOYwr.jpg" alt="cannon jump 1" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

Now we have to run against the conveyor belt here.

We break the nearby egg, and get doll piece three!

Now the elevator...

I fail the dream sprite challenge, and realize I have to use both Boomies to move the elevator without waiting for either one to explode!

Outside, more stingers await!

A Boomie is patrolling the edge nearby, with vanishing platforms and a cube outline!

When the indestructible floats close to the switch is the right time to drop the Boomie!

We grab the key. Now for the doll piece here...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/8JEfM9u.jpg" alt="doll piece 4" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

We go back and take a Boomie as a jump boost to get the piece!

Into the engine room we go!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/CqrSCJw.jpg" alt="in engine room 2" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

This puzzle's not hard, it's a matter of timing.

I throw the Boomie to the column so it wouldn't get hit by the first spikey.

It's all smooth sailing from here.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/1picu6J.jpg" alt="countdown timer 2" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

We make it out of the chamber with time to spare!

Now for the last one!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/GeiX9a4.jpg" alt="to ark hull" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

It seems that the ark itself is not letting us stop it easily.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/tB2AwBo.jpg" alt="burner hull" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

On its underside, the ark is shooting out flamethrowers and pillars to block us!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/8iYBYHJ.jpg" alt="burner hull 2" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

We made it past those flamethrowers!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/oydpJuP.jpg" alt="at tail of ark" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

Now aft, we cross its tail, as more flamethrowers try to stop us.

We make it, and Klonoa jumps down into the entrance of the ark.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ye2qbYI.jpg" alt="jump down" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/WuHcFvY.jpg" alt="at entrance" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

We carry the nearby Boomie over, and offer it up to the Ow-Gow lurking in the pipe ahead.

Up we go, and we're back outside!

After some difficulty with the next obstacle with pillars and short-fused Boomies, we cross over into the cannon!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/nlgl7uc.jpg" alt="cannon jump 2" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

Now this is proof we're close to the lategame stage.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0fAwQjQ.jpg" alt="wide gap with erbil" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/7hPVr5c.jpg" alt="wide gap 2 goomis" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

Fifth doll collected!

Jumping on big trampolines, we land on a platform, escorting us to another cannon!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ctVr2fu.jpg" alt="cannon jump 3" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

We land in the same area where we were introduced to the Likuri, but there's no Likuri here.

A stinger and a Boomie await.

One rock cleared later, and we use an Erbil to get to the perch above. Unfortunately, we couldn't break the top box.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/xbl1Rpf.jpg" alt="top box with erbil" width="480" height="270" />

***Aside***: I later find out the top box had the last doll piece! We managed to finally break that box replaying the level.

Inside, a Likuri and three enemies await...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TUjVJLy.jpg" alt="likuri with 3" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

I completely forgot how I managed to finish this level. That was how tricky it was.

Some trial-and-error later, I figure out how to solve this puzzle. 

This Likuri puzzle may be tricky, but that's easy compared to the one in the next level.

We take the cannon, which fires us to the door before the engine room.

No rollers, and the burners are on.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/71nJgyA.jpg" alt="drum with burners" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

Now this is another tricky puzzle: throwing the Boomie to the rock, and getting all the stones here.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/bvHJvxp.jpg" alt="boomie on hand" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

On attempt number four, I give up collecting the stones above the Goomis, and proceed.

I wonder where the last doll piece is?

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/3MtRGtn.jpg" alt="spinner with moo" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

We make it up to where the first turbine switch was, carefully timing the throw of the Boomie as not to hit the moving spikey.

We can access the third engine room now!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/6y2s45c.jpg" alt="third engine door" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/r7eMSaN.jpg" alt="in engine room 3" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

A single file of Boomies march below the engine.

That felt surprisingly easy.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/2Vz6zxK.jpg" alt="at engine 3" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

Now to run...

We pass all the obstacles, and double jump using the Burnie, and that's it!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/rPJzFO7.jpg" alt="explosion 3" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

Tat prefers being addressed as "Miss" Tat.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/hznfdUY.jpg" alt="crimson iris" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

With that, the ark is down for the count!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/eZGhjKH.jpg" alt="ark done" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

And one difficult level is finished!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Fi0872I.jpg" alt="vision clear" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

There it is, the portal to the Fifth Kingdom!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/4mrIfmX.jpg" alt="portal" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

We cross into the portal...

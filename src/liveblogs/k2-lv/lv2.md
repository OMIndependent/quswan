The waves lift Klonoa up and down...

Now two people appear, flying on an aircraft. Sadly, their faces are not obscured in darkness in this version.

**?**: "There he is!"<br/>
**??**: "No doubt about it! He's the one!"

The one sitting behind says "wait."

More "wow" noises (sebz tbbq by' Cbcxn)...

They see a duo coming out of the cave onshore.

**?**: "Who are they?"<br/>
**??**: "A priestess...?"<br/>
**?**: "Should we get rid of them?"<br/>
**??**: "No. We can't risk dropping the ring. Very well. We shall just wait and see."

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0TgabwX.jpg" alt="duo" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

Klonoa gets up.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/P8fCTHF.jpg" alt="klonoa up" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

The text spoiled the fact that the priestess is Lolo. She asks Klonoa if he's okay.

**Klonoa**: "Uh, um... yeah... at least... I think so..."<br/>
**Lolo**: "Thank goodness! I'm Lolo. I'm a priestess... well... a priestess-in-training. And this is Popka."<br/>
**Popka**: "Yo!"

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/AkBwnxE.jpg" alt="the ones who saved me" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

Klonoa thanks them and introduces himself.

**Lolo**: "So Klonoa... that's the name of the **Dream Traveler**."

Klonoa tries to deny being some sort of divine being, but Popka senses a creature lunging! 

That was close!

Lolo asks Klonoa for their help.

Lolo transforms into the Ring Spirit. The transformation I mentioned last game was a reversal version of this one.

Popka tells him our goal: to go to the island ayonder.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/GrfhgXQ.jpg" alt="island yonder" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

**Klonoa**: "What is this place?"

And after 20 years, the reprise of this playthrough begins!

Like the last game, I break an egg, and double jump twice to get more dream stones.

So mini-tornadoes are exclusive to this game, huh?

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/xzRkJ9q.jpg" alt="mini tornado" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

We run into our first snag.

**Popka**: "Hold it right there!"

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/BKYFNNN.jpg" alt="ledge is high" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

Popka gives us our first pointer.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/XeQrsvx.jpg" alt="nab moo" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

**Klonoa**: "You mean... do a double jump? Hmph, I already know that!"<br/>
**Popka**: "That so? Well, show me whatcha got, hotshot!"

When I played the demo, I got stuck on this part, and had to drop it. It wasn't until I rented the game eventually that I managed to succeed getting on that ledge.

Ledge climbed! I pop the first bell in a bubble, and get the first piece of a Zbzrgg doll!

After using a tornado to get more stones and a heart, we enter the cave.

The cave's beautiful and luminous...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZAH5sa5.jpg" alt="cave" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

We run into a Goomi, an object that can keep us stuck to it as long as Klonoa fires a bullet on it.

At the bridge, a Big Moo blocks our way, and I grab the loot above him. I use the tiny Moo to get up on another ledge and into the Fordon cannon.

So the taunt buttons (L and R) also work here too.

I use a runner bird to hit an egg in the background instead of using it to get a second piece of the doll here.

Using a cannon, we make it back to the foreground and break a box with a trampoline Moo. The trampoline Moos here are pink instead of yellow this time.

Outside, up to the ledge to another cannon!

Klonoa has a lot more to say than "wa-hoo" this time in the sequel!

We enter the cannon, and land on a seagull named Polly!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/lBu5LLc.jpg" alt="polly 1" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

The music is definitely the best part here.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TOxexVx.jpg" alt="polly 2" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

I do like the fact that the starting level starts as a "dark and stormy night" feel (though cliched to some), in contrast to the beautiful daytime greenery in the first game.

After we land, we get a fourth piece of the doll from a hidden egg.

This is the first time where Klonoa does not thank someone for a ride.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/otVwVPW.jpg" alt="dream sprite" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

A dream sprite challenge! Let's see if I can make this one!

I do!

At the end, we break open another egg, revealing a doll piece!

We're back outside!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/tMaKzth.jpg" alt="near island" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

The island's close!

I use a runner bird to get to a bouncing tornado, and a flying Moo.

We fire the Moo at the egg, revealing the last doll piece!

This level felt shorter than I expected, maybe because I know it too well, or maybe it's because of time...

We slide down using the branch, and we meet Popka at the end.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/fIlMEYY.jpg" alt="ring bell" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

**Klonoa**: "This thing? Well, okay."

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0con6bB.jpg" alt="bell to ring" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

Bam.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/OtS0FzR.jpg" alt="i did it" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

**Popka**: "That's the Spirit Bell for priestesses. Only those with enough spirit power can make it ring. So if ya make it ring, you're a full priestess."

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TLG59q3.jpg" alt="lolo dance" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

Popka mentions our next destination: back to good ol' Baguji (gung znavchyngbe) the Wise!

Klonoa asks who that is.

**Popka**: "The best prophet in Lunatea, that's who!"

Klonoa repeats the name of this world he's in now.

[The save theme plays again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJU_uSydZTI). Such memories...

Here we are at the minimap. This game, I think, is the first where the Klonoa games actually used one.

It seems we're called to go back to Baguji the Wise again. But we make a pit stop at Joilant first, now that we have enough Momett Dolls...

Momett thanks us mightily for returning the dolls!

**Momett**: "As a token of my heartfelt appreciation, let me introduce you to my special attraction!"

I check the scrapbook first, now that I collected all the dream stones in the first level.

New bosses have been added to the time attack last time I was here. I take them all on.

Now that's almost a world record!

Another area next to the Momett House opens!

For another time.

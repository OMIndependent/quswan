<strong>Klonoa</strong>: "The sea! It's... gone?"

The sky's now a gloomy green. It looks gloomier now.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ldIZcTo.jpg" alt="a beam of light" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

A beam of light's there.

<strong>Klonoa</strong>: "Is that...? Could that be... the Fifth Kingdom?"

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/yAYzKd6.jpg" alt="ark above k" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

The Ark's now heading for that beam of light.

Popka has the hoverboard ready.

Here we go!

This music is one of my slightly favorite pieces.

As we head down the sand river, a tornado blows behind us!

We plunge into the depths of the empty sea.

The place looks more darker compared to the original...

It's getting pretty tricky to double jump in this part of the level, even with the creatures, or is it just my controller buttons getting "heavier"?

There's Glibz here too.

We pass by a dream sprite and almost get all the stones in this tunnel.

We miss the first doll piece, so I give up a life to go back and get it...

This part of the level's a bit more trickier than I remember.

We finally get it!

The flying Moos at the tunnel are a bit more trickier to fetch.

We use one on the second take to make it up to the upper sea floor.

Another doll piece!

There's a lot of holes with teeth in this area.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/n60C8QL.jpg" alt="boarder moo" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

I wonder why there's a boarder Moo hanging around here.

Oh no, the sea floor begins to crumble!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/zMfEf2I.jpg" alt="third doll bell beyond" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

We get a third doll piece!

We're now boarding on top a floor of bones. Who was this immense creature we're on top of now?

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/hFISZE9.jpg" alt="leviathan" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

No time to think or write, as a tornado chases us!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/k04lBT5.jpg" alt="tornado 2" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

We manage to get doll piece number four before falling down into another chasm...

We collect more stones as we dodge the oncoming holes.

A fifth doll piece guarded by a moving invincible spikey is ours!

Now for the last piece ahead...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/sSKvFYW.jpg" alt="last doll bell" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

...but I slip!

Back again, and we got everything!

I got distracted by that palace of bells ayonder. I wonder if that's the ruins of the Fifth Kingdom?

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/bapVZdO.jpg" alt="palace ruins" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

Statues begin to topple as we glide our way across.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/3yLp3ym.jpg" alt="statue topple" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

The end is ahead...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZYQP7KI.jpg" alt="end ahead" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

The cannon fires Klonoa straight to the ark.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/tamu5iT.jpg" alt="help me" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

That voice still gives me a bit of the chills every time I hear it...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/x7ZTtNz.jpg" alt="vision clear" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

Counting the opening, that's the third time we hear the voice calling for help.

[Here's the music before the start of the level](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1E4MbQf89Q), and [the level's theme proper (The Sorrow Revives)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRCIgFpHJ6I).

Next session, we take on Leorina!

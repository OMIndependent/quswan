Back for another session, and it's off to the water slide ride now!

Klonoa's in awe at the ride.

Popka brings out the rental board!

And I find the first grammar typo (?) here from **Lolo**: "You can go anywhere there's a surface to slide on."

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/nEIMbbU.jpg" alt="can't swim" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

Oh, Klonoa...

This is actually the first time, to my knowledge, the franchise mentions a trait of Klonoa from Klonoa himself: he can't swim.

Popka tells him to go.

It's hoverboard time!

The music sounds grand, like starting on an adventure of sorts.

Board levels are pretty fast-paced, so I probably won't take as much notes as I do (thank goodness!)

There's a lot of those indestructible spikeys floating around mid-river.

We're introduced to a ramp-o-line (a ramp-shaped trampoline)!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/n7MHZvc.jpg" alt="rampoline" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

We get the first piece of the doll for this level!

Into a cave we go!

We end up riding the rapids downstream.

Uh-oh, more of those sharks again!

Down another waterfall!

I press L and are to make Klonoa do tricks with the board, and tip his hat off.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/T4RFGSt.jpg" alt="more sharks" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

We get another piece of a doll, and head into another cave!

We go downstream and bounce on more rampolines and get the third doll piece!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/fFFonyu.jpg" alt="downstream" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

Downstream again!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gkjuJzR.jpg" alt="new area" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

There's also cactus plants that rise from the river, I have to avoid crashing into those.

I have Klonoa take one of the Boarder Moos in single file.

Unfortunately, I end up missing a doll piece!

I end up using two lives (sorry, Klonoa) to reset and get that doll piece.

Further downstream, we run into a dream sprite challenge, but I tilt the control pad a bit too much to the right, and we fall off the ramp!

We get a fifth doll piece, but Klonoa ends up taking damage from the tall cactus plants!

Klonoa stops boarding, and Lolo emerges from the ring!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0jOpaSE.jpg" alt="k and l" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

It seems we've found our Element snatcher!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/rq951cR.jpg" alt="don't know when to quit" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

Lolo doesn't care.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/HzT9hGB.jpg" alt="i like him" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

Whoops!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/KXEVEFe.jpg" alt="huh?" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

Lolo realizes what she said, her eyes pale.

I thought Tat was going to ship-tease them...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/UR5MM2e.jpg" alt="tat shrug" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

The chase begins!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/BjlB2T1.jpg" alt="chase begin" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

From here on out, we're going to be riding in a circle until we catch Tat!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TqZSz49.jpg" alt="tat chase" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

I end up seeing the last doll piece on top of the overhang, but we miss, as I end up throwing the Moo instead of double jumping up there.

Now we're back into watery territory.

Tat jumps off the river...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/VkG0TdN.jpg" alt="end of ride" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

A cannon at the bottom takes us back up!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/pRCawhJ.jpg" alt="back to chase" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

We're catching up!

But I slow down, grab the Moo, and jump up to get the last doll piece!

Now to catch our Element snatcher...

I remember on my first go at this level, it took me a lot of tries to catch her!

On lap three, we did it!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/5tccJq4.jpg" alt="tat caught" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/1k3Ghb9.jpg" alt="real mccoy" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

**Popka**: "Ha! Serves ya right! The Element's ours."<br/>
**Tat**: "Oh pooh. So maybe I messed up. Oh well, that's okay."

It looks like Leorina and she got what they needed from us, I'm guessing.

An earthquake happens, and it's coming from the plaza!

Tat runs off, telling us to "go there... soon."

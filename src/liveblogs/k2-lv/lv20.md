After some boss battles as warm-ups, let's get started!

The gang's now in the snowy realm of Mira-Mira.

Lolo notices a city not far from where they're at, but the whole road is snowed in!

Popka decides to go into the the ring, bringing out his surprise!

Oh, Popka... :pensive:

Klonoa's face, though...

Lolo is shocked by Popka's little act of thievery, and has her pious moment here.

Popka tells them to not "be [prudes]", and to use the hoverboard. Klonoa thinks long and hard.

**Klonoa**: "Well...why not?"

We're off!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/wIGhxFw.jpg" alt="vision start" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

I'm a bit neutral on Klonoa's theme here.

We get our first doll piece in between two spikeys!

This level introduces the big ramp-o-line!

The cannon shoots Klonoa into the dragon statue's mouth!

The tunnel looks nice, but it's a bit tricky to see the dream stones...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/E65kxgN.jpg" alt="stained glass" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

The Mira-Mirans know how to decorate.

We get the second doll piece here!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/aHCFrWm.jpg" alt="klonoa out of dragon mouth" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

Out of the dragon's mouth, down to the snowy slide below, more spikeys!

We get the third doll piece on top of a mini-tornado!

We make a lot of trampoline leaps, and soon reach solid ground!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/4vAp3sA.jpg" alt="checkpoint" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

A lot of tree-shaped snowmen emerge to block our way!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/t6fI4QN.jpg" alt="snowmen" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

We grab a boarder Moo and leap past the snowmen! On the second leap, we grab the fourth doll piece!

From a cannon, into a tunnel we go!

Now this is pretty...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/lgu5hfb.jpg" alt="candle cave" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

We grab another flyer to get up to the cannon...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/7vjPj1x.jpg" alt="xmas tree" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

...and end up sliding down and around a Christmas tree!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9Px7rwt.jpg" alt="after xmas tree" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

We pass by another tunnel...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/RZGKqUP.jpg" alt="tunnel" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

...and make it back out!

We grab the last two doll pieces in this area!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/jwwtpLc.jpg" alt="phew!" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

My thoughts exactly.

**Klonoa**: "Looks like this is the end."<br/>
**Popka**: "Where's the Bell of Indecision...? Huh? Ain't it around here somewhere?"

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/C5ZIGUr.jpg" alt="bell not here" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

**Klonoa**: "We should have stopped to ask in the town."

Popka notices something ahead, though.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/cQTVE6d.jpg" alt="mansion" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

That's a strange mansion... naq ubj! Vafvqr vf bar bs gur gevpxvrfg, naq ybatrfg yriryf va guvf tnzr!

Lolo and Klonoa decide to go inside that strange place.

[Here's the music for the cutscenes in this level (Moonlight Museum) (special thanks to Wonderswan!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0O_GSbeGfk), and [Klonoa's theme (Stepping Wind)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY_6jipjKyY).

After replaying the level, I'll stop here, since the next level's going to be quite a heavy one.

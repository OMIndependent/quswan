Our doll friend is saved too.

I will note that like in the original version of this game, we can revisit the levels anytime.

\**Internally grumbles about the previous playthrough having no level revisits hagvy gur raq*\*

Our new path is open!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/fjUdAxd.jpg" alt="zoomed out" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

I notice this version has a new display of the map!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/eJXuD6m.jpg" alt="let's go" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

Lolo, at the Bell Tower, eager to ring its bell, tells Klonoa to hurry!

But, something stops Klonoa, behind us!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/sjzdRMz.jpg" alt="steam" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

**Popka**: "Leorina again?"<br/>
**Klonoa**: "Leorina?"<br/>
**Lolo**: "A bandit. She wreaks havoc on the world while seeking for treasure."

After nearly 20 years, that infamous harpsichord making up Leorina's theme rings in my ears once again.

**?**: "The nerve! They called us bandits!"<br/>
**Leorina**: "Let those fools babble all they want."<br/>
**?**: "P-I-R-A-T-E-S!"

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/3ARGXVP.jpg" alt="we're sky pirates" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

So the meower, for any newcomers, is Tat.

Leorina, all calm and cool, says her piece.

**Leorina**: "So you're the Dream Traveler... I see. You are of little consequence, but I'll relieve you of that ring."

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/yg4Tfu2.jpg" alt="not getting this ring" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

Lolo's not-having-it look is classic. Her mouth is a bit hard to see because of the lighting. Klonoa's mouth, though, is visibly moving.

Leorina shrugs. She tried, though. Now she sics her minion on us.

Glad the devs fixed the title in this version.

Like before, it's the back that's the weakness!

I end up missing the back while Folgaran's spinning around so fast.

When hit from places not on its back, it throws spikes!

Phase one over, it's not playing around now!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/YQylOdh.jpg" alt="blowing smoke" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

Now it uses its claws!

Three hits later, red steam, it's angry!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/4SwszmM.jpg" alt="blowing red steam" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

One hit and I enjoy the fireworks display, which is quite underwhelming in this version. Oh well.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/fvDc2Ng.jpg" alt="vision clear" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

Leorina and Tat look on with interest in their eyes as the peaceful music plays again.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DNrtW57.jpg" alt="hmmm" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

Klonoa sounds more blunt in this version, or maybe it's my ears.

**Tat**: "Heh-heh, you're kinda cool."

[Remembering reading some behind-the-scenes stuff, the devs made him that way](https://klonoa-at-blog.tumblr.com/post/687829494322675712/famitsu-kprs-interview-part-2) (archive [here](https://archive.ph/4Fztp)) as a step-up from the first Klonoa, as a way to indicate Klonoa growing up alongside the players, or something close to that idea.

**Leorina**: "Klonoa...I'll remember you."

They jump down, and get into their airship.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ROR9JfB.jpg" alt="airship fly" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

**Klonoa**: "The Sky Pirate... Leorina."

Now to ring that bell.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/kfNrFfZ.jpg" alt="bell of t" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

**Lolo**: "Klonoa, use your power."<br/>
**Klonoa**: "So I just shoot it, right?"

Player participation time!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/IFz30Lz.jpg" alt="shoot it" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/xcMwKDm.jpg" alt="bell rung" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

Bell rung!

**Klonoa**: "This is...the Bell's power?"

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/YwgxaBW.jpg" alt="we call it an element" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

**Popka**: "We jus' call it an **Element** for short."

So the **Green Element of Tranquility** is ours! Klonoa notes how "pretty" the Element is.

The Dream Voice calls for help again...

**Klonoa**: "Where...Where are you?!"

Back to Lunatea, Lolo calls for Klonoa.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/vlkgyx3.jpg" alt="back to lunatea" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

Klonoa looks at the Element in his hand.

In the original, the music was supposed to fade and a howling wind blow when the Dream Voice was heard at this point, which made the whole scene creepier. For some reason, this version took out that effect, keeping the music. Maybe it was too scary?

In all, aside from some gripes with the lighting and other things, I'm glad Klonoa 2 got a remake.

It definitely is coming back to me now...

Back to the main hall we go...

Now that we have 6 dolls, a popup tells us to return to the Momett House.

First, we have to go back and get the Element. Nuns.

Popka tempts fate again, mentioning Leorina not in sight.

As the gang runs over to the console...

Alarm bells ring out!

**Popka**: "Uh-oh! Itâ€™s a Volkan guard bot!"

I noticed we're fighting this bot in the table, or the barrier, of the Parliament of Volk!

Its weakness is the open panel on top of its head!

In a way, this boss is the equivalent of Gelg Bolm, with more camera action!

I forgot, this bot can fire missiles too!

Phase two, it self-inflates tires to roll Klonoa over!

I also remember just now Klonoa can walk through the big-o-lines!

Game, set, match!

The fireworks for this boss were a lot brighter this time!

**Leorina**: "Ah, well done."<br/>
**Klonoa**: "Huhi?"<br/>
**Leorina**: "Those reactors you shut down were merely decoys. This fight was all I needed from you, really."

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ULe4x8J.jpg" alt="thanks" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

**Klonoa**: "Whahoo...?! (Wha...?!) A ring...?!"

Klonoa and the gang jump down.

**Klonoa**: "A fake ring! What do you plan to do, Leorina?"<br/>
**Leorina**: "What am I up to? Hmph! Isn't it obvious?"

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/CrMvB68.jpg" alt="bell ring" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/AcsKx3e.jpg" alt="element get" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

The **Red Element of Discord** is in Leorina's possession now.

The whole hall shakes. It seems a power overload is happening...the console's blowing up, left and right!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/pcI02tM.jpg" alt="there go reactors" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

**Leorina**: "Surely an inevitable outcome, given our haste. Who cares? Volk was destroying itself anyway."<br/>
**Lolo**: "Leorina! Give the Element back!"<br/>
**Leorina**: (turns to Lolo) "Go home now, little one. **I will save your precious world.**"

Her evil laugh would give a certain character a run for his money.

Popka doesn't hesitate to go after her.

But Lolo stops...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/IdEaux7.jpg" alt="lolo sad" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

**Lolo**: "No... This isn't right. We have to shut down the reactors!"<br/>
**Popka**: "Great time ta grow a conscience!"

She calls to Klonoa.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/etBjzN6.jpg" alt="klonoa nod" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

Yes.

Off they go!

But...

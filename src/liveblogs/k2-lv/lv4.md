Here we go!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/3FcGYE6.jpg" alt="vision start" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

The music is a peaceful variation of the Lunatea Waltz.

We encounter breezy updrafts for the first time in this game.

As a Moo runs offscreen, I get a shield Moo, and hit an egg in the background.

We avoid a Sessame's spikes and use a cannon to go to the background.

I have Klonoa fall down to lower ground.

After breaking the box, we get one piece of the doll from a hidden egg.

I turn back a bit...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/SKW8AP8.jpg" alt="waterfall" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

Before going into the grotto.

At the top of the tallest thicket, we get another piece of the doll here.

There's a lot of full-heart pickups here. Knowing that Klonoa has three hearts, not six in this game, this is probably why the devs are generous.

Climbing around the luminous mushroom stem, we see our first drum platform!

The first game introduced them nearly later in the game compared to here in the second level.

We're introduced to a bouncing trampoline too.

Going downhill, and downwards...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Mkm5FKn.jpg" alt="long drop" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

That's quite a long drop!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Krq0zwX.jpg" alt="another cave" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

Back into another cave!

We collect the stones from the next trio of thickets here, and jump into the cannon.

As a Moo walks by...

Whoa!

An [Ow-Gow](https://klonoa.fandom.com/wiki/Ow-Gow) peers out of a hole and eats the cute creature!

It definitely has been too long since I replayed this game.

As we use an updraft to get higher, we throw a runner bird into an Ow-Gow den, but Klonoa gets sucked in twice!

After going higher, and passing by another Ow-Gow den, we come to a stopover per Lolo's request.

Lolo comes out of the ring, and kneels. She's praying...

**Klonoa**: "Didn't we pass by another one of these statues earlier?"

Popka says no.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/QALdJvE.jpg" alt="statue" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

So what was the one that we ran into back in the island in the Sea of Tears?

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/BGGidOM.jpg" alt="statue 2" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

In previous playthroughs, I got confused about the Claires. Is the Mother Goddess Claire the same as Claire the Ancient in the Sea of Tears? Now that I'm playing currently, I think they're different people.

Lolo's finished with her prayers.

We proceed!

The small and big spike throwers are here too.

Hmmm, I wonder where the rest of the doll pieces are?

I see two more doll pieces, above where we're at, and another out west surrounded by walls.

I manage to use up a dream sprite waiting for a Moo.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/yEYd8vi.jpg" alt="inside cave" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

We get the third bell, and breeze by, with the fourth bell in tow!

We throw a flying Moo at an Ow-Gow, get into a cannon, and were back outside!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/m7yob45.jpg" alt="pendulum" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

Ah, the infamous pendulum puzzle. Playing through this part was a bit of a challenge, but now that I'm familiar with depth...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/JCNQN34.jpg" alt="pendulum swing" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

I pick up the fifth doll piece counterclockwise, and past the updraft by throwing a Moo at the bubble.

Now the last stone column is crushed, and the door to the priestess's shrine is clear.

We encounter a hidden egg and our second doll is rescued!

Hearing this music is giving the chills.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/3GAxu0G.jpg" alt="enter hp" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

The High Priestess, in her humble glory, asks Lolo if she wishes to save the world.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/2FK1Fsa.jpg" alt="do you wish" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

No quest is easy.

The High Priestess's hair looks more green in this version.

Lolo tells her she rang the Spirit Bell in the Sea of Tears.

The High Priestess gets up, uses her staff, and a Quest 64-like sound plays!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/t4KHwBY.jpg" alt="lolo priestess" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

**High Priestess**: "Lolo, you are hereby granted the rank and responsibilities of a priestess." Yes!

Lolo bows and thanks her!

Klonoa congratulates her too.

Lolo's too excited for words.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Fr7xqDw.jpg" alt="first task" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

**High Priestess**: "And once you reach the Kingdoms, you must go and gather the power from their bells...it is the harmonious power of the bells that will make it possible for us to contain the evil. Can you do this, Lolo?"<br/>
**Lolo**: "Y-Yes! I'll do my best!"

V jbaqre, vf Uvtu Cevrfgrff qbhogvat ure?

High Priestess commands us to go to the Bell of Tranquility.

Lolo bows, and she and Popka leave.

High Priestess stops Klonoa.

[*Klonoa 2: Lunatea's Veil*][k2-link] (or 風のクロノア2 世界が望んだ忘れもの/*Klonoa of the Wind 2: The Thing That People Wanted To Forget*) is a 2.5D action puzzle platformer released for the PlayStation 2 in Japan on March 22, 2001, and developed by Namco (pre-merger to Bandai Namco in 2005). The game was later released in North America on July 25, 2001, and in Europe on November 9, 2001. This game is the sequel to the PS1 game [*Klonoa: Door to Phantomile*][k1-link].

This playthrough will cover the Nintendo Switch remake.

Since I started late, this session will be a short one. There won't be gameplay here, just story.

We make it back to Baguji, where the trio explain Leorina's presence.

**Lolo**: "Could they be trying to save the world? It sounds like we've got competition!"

Popka doesn't think so.

Yeah, I wonder why Leorina would want that ring if it doesn't work without a priestess? (Hayrff fur xabjf nobhg cevrfgubbq cenpgvprf bs fbegf...) :thinking:

Popka then concludes the ring is useless for her.

Baguji tasks us to get all the Elements.

Klonoa agrees!

**Lolo**: "**Joilant**. The entire kingdom is like a giant amusement park."

Oooh...what fun! Popka shares my thoughts.

Lolo reminds him we're not there for fun.

I decide whether to save at this point or not.

The path to Joilant is now open!

But that will be for next session!

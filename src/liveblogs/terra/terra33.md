I have Ark go to the leftmost gull, and accept his offer to fly to Safarium.

We're off!

We cross southeast to reach Africa, passing through the Sahara...

Above the Savannah now...

And we're finally here!

The gull notices the Safarium's empty...

**Gull:** "There used to be countless animals here. This was a happening place! The simple rhino Simon, Kameski the turtle, Neo the Lion King... I think Neo just had a baby... What happened to them all?"

The gull pecks the grass and sighs...

That's actually not true...

We still haven't awakened the non-avian animals from their slumber yet.

There's a save point west of the gull and the river before him, which we can't reach.

There are two shining souls on the east end of the river. The first one has new magical rings to offer: a Geo Ring, a Snow Ring, a Grass Pin, and a Wind Pin!

The other soul has the usual with one new product: **Stardew**!

I buy two and have Ark swim in the river for a little bit...

East of the waterfall is a cave...

West of this hall leads to an empty room, but Ark's HUD is on, meaning there might be a boss fight in that place soon...

Back and northwards, we go upstairs, where we see an empty lion's den...

Playing around in the water right now...

Down the waterfall we go, and we're back at the entrance...

After a little trip back to the empty room, we leave Safarium to see our new surroundings.

Southwards, we arrive at the Savannah proper...

East and north is the Arabia area.

I accidentally stumble upon the mouth of the Indus River...

The river's dried up.

Noticing a mountain pass entrance earlier, I have Ark cross into the mouth of it...

Now this is a surprise!

There's a summoner and his four worshippers genuflecting to him. Noticing us, he summons an interpretation of the Grim Reaper, or a pagan god, from the depths of the altar!

As a welcome greeting, the boss breathes green, ghastly flames!

I have Ark recover health before taking this boss on!

So their battle patterns are fire breath, a swipe attack, and throwing their scythe claws...

Once the boss throws their scythe claws is their torso vulnerable to attack...

I get my jump and attack buttons mixed up here.

After a few minutes, Ark's health is low again...

I have Ark quick-strafe left-to-right of the arena, as a way to take care of the static pagan god...

Eventually, the boss shakes and falls to the abyss, piece-by-piece...

But, the pagan god "grins slyly". It's not over yet!

The pagan god has transformed themselves into a dragon!

And we're falling down!

Fire breaths, crushing rubble, and swoops are their strategies...

This match is getting tense, I feel like this one's timed, since as we're literally descending, the screen turns red...

I manage to take swipes at the pagan dragon, but the descent's getting shaky, and we're almost out of recovery bulbs...

And we lose! This boss is a bit clever, or maybe itâ€™s because I wasn't prepared enough!

We're back at the Kingbird's Nest!

I go with the gull to Safarium again...

For some reason, the pagan god looks a bit like Qrngugbyy sebz *Fbhy Oynmre*, or rather, the first form of them, is.

I notice a crawlspace in the shrubbery of the Safarium, and we reach the save diary there!

I forgot that I have spell rings!

I buy one more from the shopkeeper and return to the Zoo...

It seems we've done good work here...

I have Ark swim eastward and north, where the floating stone is gone...

Now for round two with the pagan god!

Almost low on health, I use up a fire ring...

...that fires in the opposite direction of the boss!

Next, I use up one of the Grass Pins!

Yikes, these scythes keep hurting Ark!

After using the strafe strategy, we're back to phase two of the boss!

I use up a Pyro Ring this time, no effect.

It takes a long time, and after consuming a few medium recovery bulbs, the fireworks eventually come!

A voice calls out to Ark...

"**Ark. I have waited long for this moment. Mammals changed into monsters should regain their forms. But remember this. It is still too early for the world to be resurrected. You must lead the growth of living things.**" Why is that voice saying it's "too early" for the resurrection? Unless we're also waking up demons from their slumber too?

We see eggs splitting, and it's from a newborn's perspective, as they open their eyes...

Now, like the first shot from a certain Disney movie, the sun rises on the Safarium...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/oSswgEC.png" alt="sun rise 1" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Animals migrate westward...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/B74w0sd.png" alt="sun rise 2" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

We did it! We revived the animals!!

And that is it for tonight's session!

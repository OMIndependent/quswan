I just realized last night that Zue was a typo. This place was meant to be called Zoo.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F27TzQT58AY">Here's the background music for the Zoo, or Zue, as proof the game misspelled the area.</a>

I'm playing around a bit with the new controls since I remapped them a bit so they won't accidentally take me to the menu. I'm also checking on the menu to see the new Stardew item I bought last session...

The Stardew lifts curses, the description says, but how are we going to get cursed in this game?

I ask one of the gulls to make a return trip to Safarium so I can take on the Zoo again...

For some reason, the mosquitoes take more damage from Ark now...

Plus, I'm still low on health at the moment...

I use up a medium recovery bulb and go back to the northern part of the area.

We move north to the bedrock area....

***Aside:*** I forgot to mention that I've updated my Raspberry Pi recently, so now I can see what screenshot I took.

Up north, we meet a stretchy Chameleon and a Dungun.

After taking care of the Dungun, a soul appears with some advice.

Rainfall Altars, hmmm...

I have Ark go east, where we meet another chameleon and a Dungun.

There's a way down, but Ark can't jump off...

We go back and take the north way, where we see a big toad at the base of the canyon below...

He shoots out a poisonous cloud!

I have Ark crawl ahead. After a match with a Dungun, I jump off the cliff to face the toad.

The toad, or Douma, can use his saliva to throw Ark across the canyon!

But they're finished, and a soul is there in the Douma toad's place...

Another Douma at the west part of the canyon now!

I have Ark crawl and climb up to see the mouth of a cavern.

This cave, I'm guessing, leads to a Rainfall Altar...

We approach the Altar, where the two souls we freed earlier speak to us...

**Soul:** "When 4 souls join, a rain ritual will start. Ark. Please save our people!"

Looks like we have to go back and get two more souls to save...

The Douma toad takes massive damage!

We go back to the start of the area, and turn east.

With Ark's lunge attacks, we easily take care of most of the creatures around here...

After fighting off two lizardmen, we free the third soul!

Now to get one more soul before returning to the Altar.

We go south, and after a match with a Dungun, we free the fourth soul!

Now we go back to the altar...

Ark steps closer...

**Ark:** "Whaâ€”what?!! I feel an enormous power..."

The ritual begins...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/SEcRevt.png" alt="grass grow" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Grass begins to grow, and the rivers return...<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8_sfFLvWZ4">and the tune that birthed the continents returns</a>. That tune still gives me the chills...

Ark is amazed!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TbioC3l.png" alt="river restored" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

**Ark:** "Green is really a soothing color. You can sleep in it, and you can feed animals with it! Food?... That's it! Animals can't return because there isn't any grass for food. When more plants appear, animals should re-emerge. Like the gull mentioned, I should meet simple Simon the rhino. Kameski, the [...] turtle. And Neo, the lion, the king of all animals."

I have Ark swim to the center island and pick up a Defense potion!

I'll have to put a save state on my session here. Offline business is interfering right now...

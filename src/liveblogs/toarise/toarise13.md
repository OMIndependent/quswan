After some long loading time, we make it to the base of the ol' mine!

Holy heck!

**Iron Mask:** "What!?"

How is this sidequest going to play out now?

One of the Crimson Crows gets up, though...

His last words mention some bushes nearby.

Iron Mask is not having it now...

Shionne, in her own way, isn't too happy about the situation too. She notices something in the bushes...

Finally, does this mean we can cook soon?

Iron Mask wonders if the man hid the cooking pot with the last of his breath.

Shionne's also trying to wonder why the dying man hid it, not to mock him...

**Iron Mask:** "We'll make sure it wasn't in vain. If nothing else, this proves the Renans can be outsmarted."

**Iron Mask:** "So this is what it means to fight the Renans."<br/>
**Shionne:** "Sounds like you're kind of scared to me."<br/>
**Iron Mask:** "Of course I am. But if I'm going to die one way or another, I'd rather go down fighting."

I notice some gems near the campsite and pick them up...

I have Iron Mask look down from the partially-torn bridge to the drink below...

**Iron Mask:** "We're so high up!"

Next, I walk up the slope to where the stray zeugle is. What a creature!

No kidding.

I warm up by fighting some of the Armadillos here before reporting to Dyron.

Dyron takes whatever supplies we got back from the attack.

A girl asks when her father's coming home... it seems her father was one of the casualties... :frowning2:

Dyron tries to lie to her, but she knows what happened.

**Girl:** "I know that whenever grownups look sad and say someone's 'gone,' they always mean...they're dead. Daddy always warned me that this might happen one day. He told me to be strong and brave." :pensive:

Iron Mask's not having it any longer.

Quest complete!

Well, this is new.

The game mentions that if we get enough SP, one of our characters learn new skills from the tree.

I have Iron Mask learn **Sonic Thrust.**

I go back to the skill tree to figure out how the mech works.

**Zephyr:** "Okay, people, this is it. Ulzebek."

Iron Mask notices no guards around.

Zephyr thinks that stationing guards in town wouldn't be practical from their standpoint.

**Zephyr:** "The last place they would look for their enemies is on their own doorstep."<br/>
**Shionne:** "That is, assuming anyone actually made it here before us."

Someone raises their hand and calls out to Zephyr. Our next stop awaits.

We ask a local about the town. Ulzebek is mostly a farming rather than a mining town.

The chicken eggs were taken by the soldiers, though...

One Crimson Crows member is hiding inside a house, still in shock at the power of the soldiers.

One man tells his wife he's joining the Crimson Crows... :frowning2:

Going back up, where one man is now thinking of asking the Crimson Crows for more supplies, and out, I notice something sparkling at the town fountain...

Using jump skills, I find an Apple Gel there.

**Shionne:** "Should this really be here?"

I go up more steps, where someone is going to be sent back to Mosgul after they've recovered... :frowning2:

I try leaving, but a guard warns us about the zeugles beyond.

In a circle, people are trying to dissuade someone from joining the Crimson Crows. They've lost hope at this point...

From a Crimson Crows member, the place I was about to head to was the Iglia Wastes, full of stray zeugles, and ruins...

Climbing up more ladders, one Crimson Crows member has a good message: stay hydrated.

One ladder later, I get some more ingredients...

After some small talk, I make our way to an inn.

**Shionne:** "Looks like we get to sleep with a roof over our heads."

I check around, then the item shop, where it's a Life Bottle and some meat. Sadly, we have no money...

I sell some stuff and leave...

At least the inn's free...

I go to the north gate, where a Crimson Crows member warns us about more guards ahead.

Up to the steps to the hideout, Nayth waits for us.

A Crimson Crows member secretly gives rations to a father so he could feed his kids...

After exploring the upper west side of the town some more, I head in.

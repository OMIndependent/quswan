**Note: You can skip ahead to Part 2 if you want to get to the real gameplay. This part is just for setting up the game.**

Alright, here I go to play the newest entry in the *Tales* franchise!

The 25th Anniversary Tales logo pops up...

Along with the Unreal Engine logo...

Autosaving prompt's on, next I choose English voice...

The OP immediately starts playing, showing the cast of characters, the main duo looking on a cliff. Now we see each character: first, the young woman walking opposite people in academic uniform...

There's a man in a very earthy place...

And there's Hootle...

And there is Mayor Law...in a blizzard yelling in front of the snowy town...

Who are these villains? Who is that black hooded assassin our masked man is fighting?

And there's everyone in a grassy plain...

And that's it for the OP.

I press start, trying to take a screenshot, but no good. 

Next, more legalities to go over...

It takes me awhile to read over at this point, I can't be too careful...

At least the devs are explicit on what data they collect...

I decline the last part of the agreement, which is optional, and is only meant for the devs to collect data.

For some reason, I can't take screenshots...

I go back to the menu, and to the gallery to double-check. The screenshots I took are there! I do wish there was an indication that I took one...

After taking some out, I fiddle around with the screenshot options, and set it back to easy screenshot mode again...

Back to the game!

While changing subtitle options, I noticed a set of glyphs as a transition effect.

I go back to the PS menu (sorry!) and realize the screenshot notification is off! I turn it back on...now let's get started.

Adjusting the voice volume, I can hear "Demon Fang." Looks like this game's going back to its roots for its protagonist.

After some input fixes, here we go!

Oh boy, I don't like this at all...it seems the master core inside Shionne is trying to escape the wall of thorns...

Shionne gets up. Campfire doused.

**Shionne:** "I've gotta hurry." For what?

Where is she taking that core to?

**Zephyr:** "We have another secret hideout in Ulzebek, not far from here." Ulzebek it is.

I play another skit: **Reminiscing.**

Iron Mask asks Shionne again if they've met before. No way. Shionne mentions she's from the floating castle.

Iron Mask's astonished that people live in the floating castle.

Shionne mentions the Crown Contest again. She also asks how much time of memories Iron Mask remembers.

Shionne repeats then there was no way she and Iron Mask crossed paths.

**Shionne:** "I hate camping out." Lol...

I notice sparkling blades of grass...

I have Iron Mask pick them up: theyâ€™re Wheat! I wonder if I could make this into bread...

We cross onward to the tracks...going to the edge, it seems like this is the place where the explosives blew up...

On a cliff, we notice a giant insect, or a gigant zeugle.

This foe is beyond any of us, for now.

While collecting mushrooms, Zephyr tells us that we're almost there.

I go down the slope west of the bridge, and fight some more zeugles: **Armadillos**, in this case...

We pick up some wheat and an Orange Gel!

We walk back up to the bridge, and fight some more...

We notice something unusual: an owl.

We get a **Dog Tail**, or a shiba inu tail, as a reward.

I can also change who's on screen by pressing Change Party Leader.

I see the gates of Ulzebek, but I take a left and do more exploring...

After a battle, where I use Shionne, and where I'm out of my depth here, I collect another stone: a **Paralaxstone!**

And that's it for this area!

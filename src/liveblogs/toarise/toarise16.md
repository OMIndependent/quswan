Shionne sees the Fagan Ruins ahead, and Iron Mask's stomach grumbles. He waves it off as "no big deal." Shionne reminds him to eat just in case something happens mid-battle.

**Iron Mask:** "Never thought I'the get lectured on eating by a Renan, of all people."<br/>
**Shionne:** "Yeah, well, some of us Renans know what it's like to go without food, believe it or not." Hmmm...

Now I finally get to cook in-game!

Now you'll know, Iron Mask. One of the best staples of the *Tales* series is cooking!

Shionne doesnt know how to cook, either. I wonder who's the master chef in this game?

Shionne thinks Iron Mask needs more blue on what he's wearing right now...

When I press Rest, I get cooking pointers! Our first meal is...porridge. Shionne will do the cooking.

Shionne's surprised Iron Mask can eat through the mask. How, though?

**Iron Mask:** "I've got a newfound respect for cooking now. But I guess that's easy when you're used to eating everything raw." :frowning2:

Iron Mask accidentally complains that the food needs more flavor. Shionne asks if he can taste. He can. But he likes very spicy food.

**Iron Mask:** "Doc thinks maybe I crave spicy food to compensate for the lack of pain I feel."

Shionne decides that she'll do the cooking.

Iron Mask apologizes for his remark. "Slip of the tongue," indeed, hee.

After getting a title, Shionne gets a new skill emblem!

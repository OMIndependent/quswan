**Narrator:** "Oh, how wrong we were."

This tale of Dahna and Rena, is basically a tale of conquest and slavery...lots of fire and heat comes up when the narrator gets to Orbus Calaglia...

The only "paradise" for the Dahnans is death...

**Narrator:** "So complete is the Renans' domination..."

Lots of miners mining, and carriers carrying, and "knights" overseeing the whole thing...a woman collapses...

A child pushes a barrel that is four times his size...

...and someone stops the blow!

The iron masked man turns around. For some reason, he couldn't feel that rod hitting him.

**Iron Mask:** "Let me."

The knight amps up his sardonicness, and his squad (3rd Squad) is ordered to regroup!

He starts rolling the barrel. The masked man's back is bloody...eee...

The child thanks him. His name is Kohl.

Unfortunately, Kohl is worried about the man, as his wounds are getting worse. The iron mask notices, and takes up on seeing Doc.

Doc isn't too far, just below the hill...

I can't turn back, though, as the soldiers are there...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/mxEji5E.png" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

I check the controls. Seems I can press R1 to open the Tales series's famous skits, and R2 to dash.

There's Doc.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/MjhhMMm.png" alt="doc" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

The iron masked man is holding his not-so-good-arm...

Iron Mask apologizes.

**Doc:** "Look after yourself and there'd be no need for sorry's, would there? Now sit."

So this Iron Mask has amnesia, huh?

**Iron Mask:** "Blank, as always. Nothing but that strange dream."

Doc points out his equally unusual ability to not feel pain...and also how he can still be injured "just like everyone else."

**Iron Mask:** "I watched another slave die today." Eeee...

**Doc:** "Unfortunately, that's not a rare sight to see in these parts."<br/>
**Iron Mask:** "Dahnans are always dying. And the Renans just watch."

Iron Mask is not taking it anymore. He may not feel physical pain, but he does feel the emotional pain of others...he asks why they can't fight.

Everyone's resigned to their fate...

Doc looks around, hoping no soldiers catch wind of what Iron Mask said.

300 years of uprisings, yikes...

By the prologue, the Dahnans are clearly outmatched.

Doc tells him not to get into trouble. I chuckle a bit.

Doc tells him to be patient and "wait for the right moment. Both for yourself and the world."

Doc tells him to walk around a bit, but lay low.

This game does have the feel of epicness written all over it...

Now I just gotta rest. Now I can move faster again.

I check the map.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/PnCwInc.png" alt="map" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

Now to explore the place...

All the soldiers have blocked out the other ways out...

In the way unblocked by guards, I talk to an exhausted man, mentioning being inserted "weird stones on [his] body" and being overworked. He also mentions the soldiers siccing "zeugles" if they get into a fouler mood.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/1tCV2rB.png" alt="not have a core" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

Poor Iron Mask...but what is a spirit core?

Up at the foot of the steps, we see another casualty...

Even one of the soldiers is enjoying cremating the corpses...

Another exhausted man sitting tells us about Rena and Lenegis, the moon. I focus the camera on them...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/8ebfZsl.png" alt="rena" id="hd-liveblog" width="480" height="270" />

**Man:** "That Lenegis especially is something else. There's no way we can ever hope to beat the Renans when they can build floating castles like that."

So Lenegis is not a moon...

The locals calls the soldiers here "bright eyes," and they, in turn, call the locals "embeddeds."

So after the locals mine the fuel, the soldiers burn the fuel? Then why do it?

I turn east, another soldier blocks the way...

Hope there's no Bonnie Tyler shoutouts re: these soldiers...

There's lots of patrol here...no rest for these guys...

I go and rest.

The Iron Mask wonders how many people have been sleeping before him before sleeping himself...

Short playthrough, here we go!

We try to go back the way we came, but the mine's caved in.

**Zephyr:** "Our cover's been blown here. Get a move on, we're moving to another base."

As we transition to the next area, I get more details on this world...

We're now at the Sandinus Ravine, where the scenery's fraught with fire and desert...

It's still beautiful...

We're now introduced to the land proper...

I wish the devs used a different font face for announcing the locations, but I think it might be for readability's sake...

The trio are walking along.

The big protruding crater above is Balseph's domain.

**Shionne:** "Glanymede Castle...Stronghold of Lord Balseph, self-imposed ruler of all Calaglia."<br/>
**Zephyr:** "That's it, alright. And next to it are the Gates of Fire."

The Gates of Fire is a big mountainous wall with a skull carved on its rock face...

Zephyr and his Crimson Crows plan to tear that wall down.

Iron Mask ponders on Zephyr's last word: "freedom."

This feels a bit too easy...

Or is Balseph the Disc One boss?

I wonder if I could turn off the mini-map here...

I try, but I can't find the setting for it. Oh well.

Now I can see Shionne's stats, and Iron Mask is no longer immortal...

I go to the strategy menu and look at Shionne's artes before proceeding. It seems she knows Magna Ray and Resurrection!

As we proceed, we see more zeugles ahead. And the game gives me more pointers on enemy encounters. I wonder how to turn these pointers off?

The zeugles are basically mini-Gattusos from *Vesperia*...

After a tussle, we proceed...

Zephyr warns us not to go fighting tough waterfalls.

I have Iron Mask climb up the cliff and mine some gems, or an Antidote Rock...

**Iron Mask:** "What a weird stone."<br/>
**Shionne:** "I sense a strange power from it. We should gather as many as we can find."

I check the bestiary on what we have so far...

We run into the big golem, who's at level 9! I forgot to mention the enemies now have levels!

Iron Mask gets KO'd in one swing!

I decide to flee.

Shionne's line when escaping sort of makes me chuckle inside.

**Shionne:** "Let's flee and go get a bite to eat instead." Speaking of which, when are we going to cook?

After fleeing, I see a chest and open it: **3 Life Bottles!** Now this is going to be useful!

We cross the ravine and see a campfire up ahead. Zephyr decides to stop at this point. Iron Mask's raring to go, same. But Zephyr knows rest is a fleeting moment.

**Zephyr:** "Fail to grab these moments while you can, you'll end up regretting it later."

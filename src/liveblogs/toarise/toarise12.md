Tilsa and Grenar (the young man) see us, and Tilsa asks about the next plan: the blazing sword ace.

**Tilsa:** "So were finally going head-to-head with Balseph." That was quick.

Zephyr thinks an outfit change for Iron Mask and Shionne is in order. Agreed.

Shionne, by her eyes, is not interested in changing. She's not proud of renouncing her Renan garb.

Tilsa suggests asking Nayth for intel.

So the outfit we got for Iron Mask is **Ocean Blue Battle Garb**.

Sad news is Zephyr left the party. Bye, Zephyr.

I hear an owl somewhere nearby.

Another skit plays: **Like Water and Oil.**

Shionne's surprised at the community of the town. She thinks Balseph is thinking he's untouchable because he hasn't sent any troops to hunt down Crimson Crows members. His arrogance is his weakness.

Iron Mask mentioning the Dahnans' purpose as energy for a contest on who could be the next Renan ruler is just sad...

She's a fighter.

Iron Mask asks her about whether Renans think the same way as she does. I'm guessing no: they are obsessed at climbing the class ladder.

**Shionne:** "I have something I need to do, and I'll do whatever it takes and use whoever and whatever I need in order to get the job done. **To hell with 'power.'**"

We ask a Crimson Crows member all of the questions we have. She mentions the lords wear clothes out of "weird fabric." How?

Zephyr's planning out the groupâ€™s next move.

I hear more hooting.

I climb up, and find another owl.

We get more accessories: **Rabbit Ears.**

Shionne's surprised at owls being in unusual places.

After going around town, I give Shionne the Rabbit Ears.

Nayth's at the town square...

Before talking to him, I check out the idle animations of the duo.

Iron Mask asks for help, Nayth also wants help.

We talk to the nearby informant, who's pretty excited to meet Iron Mask, but not so about Shionne. The informant Dyron owns the local inn.

He asks us to bring some supplies in.

And thus, out first side quest begins!

While on the way there, I miss a giant pond...

Climbing down, we get what we missed...

So now we can swim in this Tales game, yes!

We grab the nearby carp and **Sage**, and climb back up...

And that's it for tonight!

There's the entrance.

Could this place be a mining castle of sorts?

**Shionne:** "This must be it. Looks pretty ancient, but I recognize Renan architecture when I see it."<br/>
**Iron Mask:** "[The door's] seen some beatings. If it's stayed sealed all this time, it's not cause people left it alone."<br/>
**Shionne:** "The Renans build their structures out of special materials, too." So the Renans are very technologically advanced.

Shionne's eyes glow blue, and the door opens!

New skit: **Mutual Hunger.**

Iron Mask felt like he just had a big feast, and wonders if Dahnans were only being fed minimally to prevent insurrections...

Shionne sort of sees his point.

Shionne lets slip that her own kind don't treat her well too, even if she was "squeaky clean." Another stomach's grumbling. It's hers. She denies it. 

Iron Mask offers the porridge leftovers...

...and she takes it.

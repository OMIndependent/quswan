Back to Nayth, who knows the Crimson Crows are undermanned and outnumbered.

Iron Mask asks if there are places to find weapons and gear from the Renan side...

Nayth mentions that we can't go "poking around" casually, but that's a given.

**Nayth:** "Across the wilderness of Ulzebek, you'll find the Fagan Ruins. There's some kind of ol' Renan castle out there. Other than being impenetrable, I forgot. But, with a Renan tagging along, who knows? Maybe you can find some way in."

Nayth suggests Shionne change into Dahnan garb.

A new skit: **Renan Technology.**

Iron Mask's curious about the rifle, and how she's able to "unsheath" it. Itâ€™s from hammerspace, or "transferal tech."

**Iron Mask:** "...it sounds pretty amazing." If only we could have that tech in real life.

**Shionne:** "You realize you're praising the tech of your enemies, right?"<br/>
**Iron Mask:** "So? Tech is tech. It's not good or bad in and of itself."

We stay at an inn and then go up to the ruins.

Before I go up to the ruins, I notice we have a sidequest. He asks us about the gigant zeugle. He wants us to take care of that. I say yes. But not now, we are not strong enough.

The Giant Zeugle Hunt begins, and the zeugle is a Mantis...

First, off we go to the main quest...
